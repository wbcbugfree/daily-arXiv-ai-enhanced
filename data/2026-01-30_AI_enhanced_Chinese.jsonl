Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark across 17 fields to evaluate long-horizon, multi-step information-seeking agents.

SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech.

This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss.

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM.

To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales.

Pre-print", "summary": "Natural-language user profiles have recently attracted attention not only for improved interpretability, but also for their potential to make recommender systems more steerable. By enabling direct editing, natural-language profiles allow users to explicitly articulate preferences that may be difficult to infer from past behavior. However, it remains unclear whether current natural-language-based recommendation methods can follow such steering commands. While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness. Finally, we offer practical design suggestions informed by our findings and discuss future steps in steerable recommender design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165SteerEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4ece\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u5230\u5185\u5bb9\u8b66\u544a\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u64cd\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 steerability \u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u77e5\u540d\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSteerEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece genres \u5230 content-warning \u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u64cd\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f17\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f17\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u5bf9\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6743\u8861\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684SteerEval\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u5b8c\u5584\u5e72\u9884\u96c6\u5408\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL.

Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time.

We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy.

After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c22\u5316\u7269\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\uff1b\u5728450\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u751f\u62101000\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u540e\u53d1\u73b06\u79cd\u65b0\u5316\u5b66\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d4\u79cd\u7ecfDFT\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u671b\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u6c22\u5b58\u50a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08\u5982Materials Project\uff09\u5bf9\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c22\u5316\u7269\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u6c22\u5b58\u50a8\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c22\u5316\u7269\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4ee5450\u6761\u6837\u672c\uff08270\u8bad\u7ec3\u300190\u9a8c\u8bc1\u300190\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u62101000\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\uff1b\u518d\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u516d\u4e2a\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa6\u4e2a\u672a\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5316\u5b66\u5f0f\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d4\u4e2a\u88ab\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff08DFT\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f3a\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5145\u6c22\u5b58\u50a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Evaluated in offline experiments and online A/B tests on an e-commerce search advertising platform serving tens of millions of users daily, our method delivers significant offline gains, showing clear benefits in both commercial performance and user experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u7535\u5546\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1aMPCoT \u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001SFT+Direct Preference Optimization \u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u3001LRKD \u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5143\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1 CoT \u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u8981\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u5f80\u5f80\u4e22\u5931 CoT \u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2 CoT (MPCoT) \u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u7531\uff1b\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u3002\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\u5f15\u5165 latent reasoning knowledge distillation (LRKD)\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6f5c\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u65e5\u5747\u6570\u5343\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5728\u7ebf A/B \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u660e\u786e\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528 CoT \u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature.

On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "OS-Search \u5c06 LLM \u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7aef\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4 Z \u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807 z* \u7531\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u9009\u53d6\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22-\u57fa\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5750\u6807\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1 z*\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u626b\u63a0\u4e0e\u5bf9 Z \u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5bf9\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u626b\u63cf Z\uff08\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4f7f LLM \u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u63d0\u5347 3.1 \u500d\uff1b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728 Z \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u672a\u62ab\u9732\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 token \u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4 OS-Search\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4 Z \u4e2d\u6311\u9009\u76ee\u6807 z*\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22-\u57fa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0b\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5750\u6807\u843d\u5728 z* \u9644\u8fd1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c Z \u7684\u626b\u63a0\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u5728 Z \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff08\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u672a\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6545\u4e8b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e Z \u7684\u626b\u63a0\u4f7f LLM \u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 3.1\u00d7\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\u5bf9 Z \u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u88ab\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u672a\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OS-Search \u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e8e\u9010\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648.

Nonetheless, emerging evidence shows that CDR can inadvertently heighten group-level unfairness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis to uncover why these fairness issues arise. Specifically, we identify two key challenges: (i) Cross-Domain Disparity Transfer, wherein existing group-level disparities in the source domain are systematically propagated to the target domain; and (ii) Unfairness from Cross-Domain Information Gain, where the benefits derived from cross-domain knowledge are unevenly allocated among distinct groups. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Domain Fairness Augmentation (CDFA) framework composed of two key components.

In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e09\u5927\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\uff1a\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u3001\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5173\u8054\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u77ed\u8bed\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e186\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd9\u4e09\u8005\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u83b7\u53d6\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u8d21\u732e\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u4f3c\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5206\u6790\uff08\u8986\u76d6186\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u79cd\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e09\u79cd\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e09\u79cd\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5927\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u7531\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\u5171\u540c\u652f\u6491\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6761\u901a\u5411\u76f8\u4f3c\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Noisy but Valid \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u88c1\u5224\u7684 LLM \u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684 Type I \u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u53ca Oracle \u95f4\u9699\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bf9 Large Language Models \u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u88c1\u5224\u5224\u65ad\u6765\u5224\u5b9a\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u662f\u5426\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u88c1\u5224\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u9633\u6027\u7387(TPR)\u4e0e\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387(FPR)\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b9\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684 Type I \u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236(\u6709\u6548\u6027)\u3002\u4e0e PPI \u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ed9\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f8\u8f83\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728 Jigsaw Comment\u3001Hate Speech\u3001SafeRLHF \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u53c2\u6570\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u7684 Oracle \u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u88c1\u5224\u8005\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u88c1\u5224\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u529f\u6548\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u88c1\u5224\u8005\u60c5\u5f62\u7ed9\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u529f\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5728 LLM \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions.

However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping.

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

Landry", "Eugene Yang", "Suzan Verberne", "Andrew Yates"], "title": "LANCER: LLM Reranking for Nugget Coverage", "comment": "ECIR 2026", "summary": "Unlike short-form retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as factoid question answering, long-form RAG requires retrieval to provide documents covering a wide range of relevant information. Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $\u03b1$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods.

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u201c\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u5934\u201d\uff08ep heads\uff09\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8df3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u4ee4\u724c\u4f4d\u70b9\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u6d3b\u5316 ep \u5934\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8df3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8df3\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u591a\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u201c\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u5934\u201d\uff08ep heads\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u6d3b\u5316\u5b83\u4eec\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ea0\u9519\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684 token \u4f4d\u70b9\uff1b\u79fb\u9664\u5355\u4e2a ep head \u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c LLM \u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8df3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u6d3b\u5316 ep heads \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8df3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6ACQO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ea7\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8def\u5e76\u884c\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u68c0\u7d22\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u6b67\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u5355\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u66b4\u6da8\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACQO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784(AQR)\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2) \u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408(RSF)\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(CRL)\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ACQO\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5177\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CRL\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHARP\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316LLMs\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4f24\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4f7f\u7528CVaR95\u7b49\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5448\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5c3e\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4ef7\u504f\u91cd\u5747\u503c\u5316\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9700\u5c06\u4f24\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u7ef4\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f24\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u6545\u969c\u6c47\u603b\uff1b\u4ee5\u52a0\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9762\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08\u4ee5CVaR95\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5bf911\u79cd\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u5728901\u6761\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u66b4\u9732\u4e0e\u6ce2\u52a8\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u8d85\u8fc72\u500d\uff1b\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c3e\u90e8\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5904\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a scalar \u57fa\u51c6\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u753b\u50cf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "LMK pooling uses landmark tokens to bridge chunks in a sequence and mean-pools over landmarks to form the final representation, improving long-context extrapolation while preserving local cues.", "motivation": "Standard pooling (CLS or mean) struggles with long sequences: CLS concentrates information at early positions, while mean pooling dilutes salient local signals, hurting short-context performance.

To consolidate existing research and establish model collaboration as a school of thought, we present MoCo: a one-stop Python library of executing, benchmarking, and comparing model collaboration algorithms at scale. MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo. We envision MoCo as a valuable toolkit to facilitate and turbocharge the quest for an open, modular, decentralized, and collaborative AI future.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoCo \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u7ad9\u5f0f Python \u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d626\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e25\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u53ef\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa MoCo\uff0c\u6536\u96c626\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u7531\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001logit\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1b\u6574\u540825\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u6709\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1/\u591a\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u572861.0%\u7684(model, data)\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c2\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u523025.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "MoCo \u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f AI \u672a\u6765\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality.

We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper.

To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128.

However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \\textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{JADE} (\\textbf{J}oint \\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{D}ynamic \\textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \\textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality.

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks.

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%.

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM Interpreter converts diagrams into concise CDL textual descriptions; an off-the-shelf LLM performs reasoning on CDL; training uses CoT-augmented SFT and GRPO with CDL-matching rewards; dataset Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT; data-efficient and competitive results on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, MathVista (5.5k data).", "motivation": "LLMs struggle with visual diagrams in PGPS.

Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDM is a conditional denoising model that learns the geometry of the physical solution manifold by denoising states, enabling a time-independent fixed-point inference that projects noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold and achieving superior data/parameter efficiency and physical consistency.", "motivation": "Surrogate models often trade data fit vs. physical law adherence; soft physics losses or post-hoc corrections fail to guarantee strict compliance or intrinsic geometry.", "method": "Train a conditional denoising network to map noisy states to clean ones, learning a vector field toward the valid subspace; formulate a time-independent fixed-point iteration to project onto the equilibrium manifold.", "result": "On a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, CDM shows higher data and parameter efficiency than physics-consistent baselines; denoising objective acts as an implicit regularizer, yielding better adherence to physical constraints without needing explicit physics losses.", "conclusion": "Denoising-based geometry learning can outperform physics-integrated loss approaches, providing a principled, efficient surrogate that enforces PDE-like constraints by design."}}

While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.", "AI": {"tldr": "FrontierScience \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u6709 Olympiad \u4e0e Research \u4e24\u6761\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u767e\u9898\uff08\u5176\u4e2d 160 \u9053\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u91d1\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u7531\u56fd\u9645\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u5956\u724c\u5f97\u4e3b\u4e0e\u535a\u58eb\u7ea7\u5b66\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "1) Olympiad \u8def\u7ebf\uff1a\u56fd\u9645\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u6c34\u5e73\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3a\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u5956\u724c\u5f97\u4e3b\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u961f\u6559\u7ec3\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u539f\u521b\u6027\u4e0e factuality\uff1b2) Research \u8def\u7ebf\uff1aPhD \u7ea7\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u79d1\u7814\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u9897\u7c92\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u7b49\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9898\u91cf\u6570\u767e\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u542b 160 \u9053\u5f00\u6e90\u91d1\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u9898\u76ee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5230\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u578b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures.

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) \u5728\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5236\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u7ea6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u524d\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u7528 Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u566a\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u53ef\u884c\u96c6\u5408\u3001\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u52a0\u566a\u4ee5\u91c7\u6837\u7ea6\u675f\u8fb9\u9645\u3002", "result": "\u5728 2D \u5206\u5e03\u3001\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cPPR \u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u7ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u5177\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u62df\u5408\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1bPPR \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$).

Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation.

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa TACO \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b warm-start \u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6cdb\u5316\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6 TACO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u653e\u677e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559 inductive bias \u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b warm-start \u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6865\u63a5\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6700\u5c0f\u9876\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u4e0a\uff0cTACO \u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u60c5\u5f62\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO \u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763 NCO \u7684\u666e\u9002\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa DoVerifier\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5 LLM \u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7 do-Calc \u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8868\u5c42\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5224\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u4ee5\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DoVerifier\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5224\u5b9a LLM \u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7 do-calculus \u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDoVerifier \u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ea0\u6b63\u56e0\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "DoVerifier \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it.

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations.

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation).

The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks.

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Drive-KD proposes a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework for autonomous driving, decomposing perception, reasoning, and planning into capability-specific single-teacher models via layer-specific attention, then unifying into a multi-teacher distillation with asymmetric gradient projection to reduce cross-capability conflicts.

We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability.

Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor.

We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training.

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "CNRE \u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5185\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u795e\u7ecf-\u903b\u8f91\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u51cf\u7f13\u6df7\u6742\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u518d\u5230\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u8ffd\u6c42\u6027\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff09\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u94fe\u7684\u5185\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "CNRE \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6d3e\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u795e\u7ecf-\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u5982\u5408\u53d6\u3001\u6790\u53d6\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u60f3\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6df7\u6742\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e CNRE \u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5230\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5185\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u964d\u4f4e\u6df7\u6742\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets.

However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales.

Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency.

This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost.

Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods.

While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d/\\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $\u03ba= \\mathcal O(\\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\\sqrt{T})$.

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLaT\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9690\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4ea7\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u624d\u7531\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u60f3\u6cd5\u843d\u5730\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u900f\u660e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CoT\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6b65\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u3001\u5141\u8bb8\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u60f3\u843d\u5730\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4ea7\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5185\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ec8\u6b62\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406-\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u63a8\u7406-\u843d\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPLaT\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4ea7\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7ec8\u6b62\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u8d2a\u5fc3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u4f46PLaT\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406-\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u51fa\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6709\u5229\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events.

By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset.

To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes.

Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical \"reasoning horizon gap\": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching.

In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\\frac{2}{3}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time.

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy.

We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments.

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Adversarial Memory Adaptation (AMA) \u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa/\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u4e09\u65b9\u5faa\u73af\uff08 challenger/evaluator/adapter \uff09\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u83b7\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u5728 LoCoMo \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8ba9\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u5177\u5907\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 challenger \u4ea7\u751f\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56de\u7b54\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\uff1bevaluator \u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff1badapter \u9488\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6848\u4f8b\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5185\u5bb9\u53cc\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002AMA \u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6 LoCoMo \u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e AMA \u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AMA \u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation.

Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus.

In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios.

The paper presents a GPT-based architecture with selective fine-tuning for clinical text classification, including detailed architectural diagrams, learning curves, and evaluation figures such as ROC curves and confusion matrices", "summary": "The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs) has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, cohort identification, and clinical decision support. However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.\n  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.\n  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.\n  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06GPT-2\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2aTransformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316EHR\u6587\u672c\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728GPT-2\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u53ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2aTransformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u540e\u7684LayerNorm\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u6587\u672c\u7684CheXpert\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u4eceMIMIC-IV-Note\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u9010\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u75be\u75c5\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5426\u5b9a/\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0e\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u627e\u5230\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cEHR\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\u03bb\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.042$).

In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate.

In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally.

We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA)\uff0c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u5143\u56de\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u91cd\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5934\u90e8\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u7535\u8def\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u5bfb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5426\u51b3\u5b9a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7535\u8def\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u4f4d\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728 Pythia \u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5411\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u589e\u8865\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5934\u90e8\u4e0e ICL \u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6a5f\u5236\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5e72\u9884\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u91cd\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982 LaTeX\u3001XML\uff09\u5145\u5f53\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5934\u90e8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u4e5f\u4f34\u968f ICL \u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5934\u90e8\u4e0e ICL \u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u7ebf\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u7535\u8def\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7535\u8def\u5efa\u7acb\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc LLM \u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4e3a\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7535\u8def\u6536\u655b\u63d0\u4f9b\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ARGORA\uff1a\u5c06\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u56fe\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bba\u70b9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ea0\u504f\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e89\u8bae\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u56e0\u679c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u805a\u5408\u6574\u5408\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bba\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bba\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba8\u8bba\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u56fe\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u8bba\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5c06\u8be5\u56fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5220\u9664\u5355\u4e2a\u8bba\u70b9\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ea0\u504f\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7528\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cARGORA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ea0\u504f\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u5f53\u4e13\u5bb6\u521d\u6b21\u610f\u89c1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u66f4\u5e38\u7ea0\u6b63\u81f3\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u800c\u975e\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u8bba\u70b9\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "ARGORA\u4e3a\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u7ea0\u504f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u5347\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "TimeSliver \u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u5171\u540c\u6784\u5efa\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6bb5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65f6\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u6cd511%\uff0c\u572826\u4e2aUEA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6/\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u72b6\u6001\u654f\u611f\u3001\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d faithful \u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u8054\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTimeSliver \u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611%\uff1b\u572826\u4e2aUEA\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e2%\u4e4b\u5185\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeSliver \u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer.

To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence.

We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\\sqrt\u03c1$, where $\u03c1$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e26\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cPLS-SVD\u5728\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u72ec\u7acb\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u63a9\u853d\u540e\u7684\u4e92\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u88absqrt(\u03c1)\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0BBP\u578b\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed9\u51fa\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u516c\u5f0f\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u548c\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u56fe\u548c\u6062\u590d\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u72ec\u7acb\u7f3a\u5931\u7684PLS-SVD\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u201c\u8109\u51b2\u201d\u578b\uff08spiked\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u5bf9\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u53d8\u9608\u503c\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6307\u5357\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u853d\u540e\u7684\u4e92\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u88ab\u4e58\u4ee5\u221a\u03c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7BBP\uff08Baik\u2013Ben Arous\u2013P\u00e9ch\u00e9\uff09\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u503c-\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u5171\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\uff1b\u8986\u76d6\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e25\u683c\u7684BBP\u578b\u76f8\u53d8\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e3b\u5947\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e3b\u5947\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u5eb8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u7684\u6781\u9650\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u534a\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u56fe\u548c\u6062\u590d\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0cPLS-SVD\u4ecd\u80fd\u5728\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u754c\u9650\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6307\u5f15\u3002"}}

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored.

We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized.

Pan"], "title": "Chain Of Thought Compression: A Theoritical Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Order-r Interaction\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5448\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u82e5\u8df3\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c31\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c4f\u969c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 NatBool-DAG \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa ALiCoT\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728 token \u5206\u5e03\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u7ea6 54.4x\uff09\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u663e\u5f0f\u8fde\u9501\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u542b CoT \u538b\u7f29\u7684\u673a\u7406\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Order-r Interaction \u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u6784\u5efa NatBool-DAG \u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u6392\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u6377\u5f84\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa ALiCoT \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728 token \u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5448\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c4\u7ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a NatBool-DAG \u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff1bALiCoT \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff0854.4x\uff09\u4e14\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f CoT \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f0f CoT \u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u88ab\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba-\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0cALiCoT \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\\widetilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability.

However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens.

While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages.

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \\underline{A}c\\underline{t}ive Latent \\underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \\textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \\textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa TGCC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51dd\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u51dd\u805a\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51dd\u7ec3\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1/\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u5f97\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a1) \u4ece\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u51dd\u805a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u539f\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u51dd\u7ec3\u56fe\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u56fe\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 FinReport \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTGCC \u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe 13.41%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u6210 5/6 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art\u3002", "conclusion": "TGCC \u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u51dd\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1/\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u4e5f\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets.

In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods.

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems.

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity.

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\\% higher accuracy, 22.90\\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With \"supervised\" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off.

However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5956\u8d4f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5934\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u6291\u5236\u5176\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 RLHF \u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u8d4f\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u5949\u627f\u504f\u597d\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u751a\u81f3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u5c06\u5956\u8d4f\u9884\u6d4b\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u5145\u5206\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u548c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5982\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u5949\u627f\u504f\u597d\uff09\u3002\u5956\u8d4f\u5934\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u5934\u5bf9\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c RLHF \u7684\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5956\u8d4f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38 RLHF \u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5bf9\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5949\u627f\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u53bb\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u8d4f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e RLHF \u6548\u679c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9 Attention-FFN \u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff08AFD\uff09\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728 rA-1F \u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18 A/F \u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6821\u51c6\u4eff\u771f\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u541e\u5410\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bbe\u5907\u7a7a\u95f2\u3002", "motivation": "AFD \u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e FFN \u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5141\u8bb8\u72ec\u7acb\u6269\u5c55\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9 Attention/FFN \u7684\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b65\u7ea7\u963b\u585e\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7a7a\u95f2\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf sizing \u6307\u5357\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u5e73\u7a33 token \u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\uff1aAttention \u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u968f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\u4e14\u8fde\u5e26\u8bf7\u6c42\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6765\u4e14\u957f\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\uff1bFFN \u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5728\u805a\u5408\u6279\u4e0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e A/F \u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u6821\u51c6\u7684 AFD \u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18 A/F \u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u6700\u4f18\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u76f8\u5dee\u7ea6 10% \u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a AFD \u62c6\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 rA-1F \u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7a7a\u95f2\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5f39\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields.

Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedGALA: \u5728\u8054\u90a6\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50GNN\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3PLM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe-\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u7ea614.37%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u9650\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u514b\u670d\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728FedGFMs\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50GNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684PLM\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6c9f\u901a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0ePLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe\u7ea614.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedGALA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3FedGFMs\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe-\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism.

We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning.

Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MADI\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Patch-level Alignment\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ee5\u53ca\u5173\u952e token \u9ad8\u4eae\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLMs\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e13\u7528MLLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u4e0e\u5171\u6027/\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "(1) Patch-level Alignment\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b(2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction\uff1a\u5c06\u5171\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u9002\u914d\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b(3) Critical-token Highlighting\uff1a\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMADI\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684MLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MADI\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios.

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks.

Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format.

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5907\u4ef6\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u95ed\u73af\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u805a\u7126\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u5982MAE/RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8425\u6307\u6807\uff08\u603b\u6210\u672c\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u7b49\u5bf9\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u9762\u5411\u5907\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b2) \u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u8425KPI\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u60c5\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728KPIs\u4e0a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u5e26\u6765\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u8fd1\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u8861\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u843d\u5730\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u7eaf\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8425\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4ece \u03b5/velocity \u8f6c\u5411 x \u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 k-Diff \u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570 k\uff1b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u53ca\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0ck-Diff \u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4f55\u504f\u5411 x \u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65ad\u5c42\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u516c\u5f0f\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e3a\u4f55\u66f4\u9002\u5408 x-pred \u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u7531\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa k-Diff \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570 k\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u5916\u90e8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0cx-prediction \u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff1bk-Diff \u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570 k\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u7406\u6027\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff1bk-Diff \u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining.

We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\\times$ and KV cache by $R\\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\\% and decoding speedups up to 117\\% on long sequences.

The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\\% and 4.63\\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\uff08Chain-of-Meta-Thought, CoMT\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Confidence-Calibrated RL, CCRL\uff09\u6765\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SFT+RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u628a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1) CoMT\uff1a\u4ee5\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u6d89\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u53d6\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002 2) CCRL\uff1a\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u4e3a2.19%\uff08\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u548c4.63%\uff08\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u964d65\u201370%\uff0c\u4ee3\u5e01\u6d88\u8017\u4e0b\u964d50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u5219\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAGE \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u65e0\u72ec\u7acb\u8bcd\u8868\u91cd\u7528\u5f00\u6e90 LLM \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u5316\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9 GBPO \u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 OneRec \u7684 GBPO\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u72ec\u7acb\u8bcd\u8868\u589e\u52a0\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5bf9\u539f\u751f LLM \u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u5e8f\u5217\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u201c\u5956\u52b1\u5d29\u6e83\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9879\u5e94\u7528\u201cBoost Factor\u201d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u201d\u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u9501\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301 GBPO \u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE \u4e3a\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8bcd\u8868\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models.

In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Large Lookup Layer (L^3)\uff1a\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e token \u7684\u8def\u7531\u805a\u5408\u591a\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u914d\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe 2.6B \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u540c\u7b49\u7a00\u758fMoE\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u91c7\u7528 Mixture-of-Experts\uff08MoE\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9700\u989d\u5916\u635f\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5929\u7136\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u90e8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u7684\u601d\u8def\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa L^3 \u5c42\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e token \u7684\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a token \u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6309\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5730\u7ec4\u5408\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e CPU \u5378\u8f7d\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\uff1b2) \u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u89c4\u6a21\u8fbe 2.6B \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "L^3 \u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u540c\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7684 MoE \u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u8868\u73b0\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e/\u6216\u76f8\u8fd1\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\uff0cL^3 \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8f74\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e0e iso-sparse MoE\u3002"}}

This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6094\u759a\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa PFLdim \u4e0e PMSdim\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5728\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u4e0e\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u7ed9\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u6b64\u7c7b\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7248\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) \u6765\u523b\u753b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) \u6765\u523b\u753b\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u754c\uff1b\u5c06\u96c6\u5408\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u754c\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9 minimax regret \u7684\u8fd1\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u5f81\uff1aPFLdim \u7cbe\u786e\u652f\u914d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u4e0e\u6094\u759a\u754c\uff1bPMSdim \u63d0\u4f9b\u968f\u673a\u5316\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u7d27\u754c\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6709\u9650 Helly \u6570\u3001\u5d4c\u5957\u6807\u7b7e\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3 Raman \u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u96c6\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6094\u759a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u96c6\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u96c6\u5408\u96c6 online learning \u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u60c5\u5f62\u3002"}}

However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism.

Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood.

Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability).

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark.

Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration.

Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u6570\u503c\u6216\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5bf9LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u5f97\u5230\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7b49\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u5907\u6f5c\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5177\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u7684LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7 elicitation \u534f\u8bae\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u7acb/\u5f03\u9009\u80fd\u6539\u5584 stated-\u4e0e forced-choice \u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728 revealed \u7aef\u5f03\u9009\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 SvR\uff1b\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u534f\u8bae\u4e14\u9700\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\u4e0e elicitation \u5236\u7ea6\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1b\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c elicitation \u534f\u8bae\u5bf9 SvR \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u572824\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd elicitation \u534f\u8bae\u3002\u5141\u8bb8 stated preference \u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u7acb\u4e0e\u5f03\u9009\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83 volunteer \u7684 stated \u4e0e forced-choice \u7684 Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u6027(\u03c1)\u3002\u5728 revealed preferences \u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u5f03\u9009\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u03c1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5728 AIRiskDilemmas \u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9 SvR \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5141\u8bb8\u4e2d\u7acb/\u5f03\u9009\u7684 stated elicitation \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8 \u03c1\uff1b\u5728 revealed \u7aef\u589e\u52a0\u5f03\u9009\u5bfc\u81f4 \u03c1 \u9644\u8fd1\u4e3a\u96f6\u6216\u8d1f\u503c\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e2d\u7acb\u7387\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728 AIRiskDilemmas \u4e0a\u672a\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u5347 SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u504f\u597delicitation\u9700\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406 indeterminate preferences\u3002"}}

We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ea7\u8054\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Cascaded Transfer Learning\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ea7\u8054\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5206\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8de8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u53d7\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6709\u5e8f\u3001\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5730\u4f20\u9012\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u6839\u6811\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u6309\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fde\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6811\u652f\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6811\u5f62\u7ea7\u8054\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u914d\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6VERSA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6765\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1VAEP\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u4ef6\u987a\u5e8f\u9519\u4e71\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6765\u6e90\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Bepro\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684K\u8054\u8d5b\uff082024\u8d5b\u5b63\uff09\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91cf\u531618.81%\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6765\u6e90\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8VAEP\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ecfVERSA\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8de8\u6765\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7ea0\u9519\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5c06VAEP\u7b49\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b18.81%\u539f\u59cb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u8db3\u7403\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects).

At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Reset-and-Discard (ReD) \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff08coverage@cost\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u6216\u65e0 pass@k \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u65ad\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u53ca\u8282\u7701\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd LLM \u4e0e HumanEval \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u7ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5 pass@k \u8861\u91cf\u6b63\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u968f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u589e\u957f\u5448\u73b0\u5e42\u5f8b\u578b\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ca\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c pass@k \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Reset-and-Discard (ReD) \u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u4e22\u5f03\u4f4e\u6548\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6@cost\uff1b\u5728\u5df2\u77e5 pass@k \u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b ReD \u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8282\u7701\uff1b\u5728\u672a\u77e5 pass@k \u65f6\uff0cReD \u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd LLM \u4e0e HumanEval \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReD \u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\u3001token \u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u529f\u7387\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "ReD \u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u6709\u65e0 pass@k \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components.

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "A data-driven, post hoc method to define the Operational Design Domain (ODD) using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation, enabling certification of safety-critical AI via a Safe-by-Design approach.

However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa FlexCausal\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684 VAE \u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7f20\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Factorized Flow \u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5916\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7f20\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u89d2\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5747\u503c\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f7c\u6b64\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5916\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa FlexCausal \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684 VAE\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Factorized Flow-based Prior \u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u6a21\u5916\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFlexCausal \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\u7f1d\u5408\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee5\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u91cd\u6784\u3001CKA\u3001RSA\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u542b\u4e49\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7f1d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u7f1d\u5408\u5177\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u53cc\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5c06\u91cd\u6784\u578b\u5ea6\u91cf\u53caCKA/RSA\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6210\u7acb\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bb9\u91cf\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1) \u7f1d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\uff1b2) \u7f1d\u5408\u662f\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u53cc\u5411\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b3) \u91cd\u6784\u578b\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0eCKA/RSA\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u662f\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b4) \u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b5) \u8868\u5f81\u6027\u5145\u8981\u4f46\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff1b6) \u5b58\u5728\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u6d3e\u751f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u6784\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u6700\u5927\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u6784\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u53cc\u5411\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM.

Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6309\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u4e3a\u51b2\u7a81\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u51b2\u7a81\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3001\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5f62\u6210Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL)\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u5230LLMs\u65f6\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5f3a\u8d1f\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u4e3a\u51b2\u7a81\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff08\u7ea650%-75%\uff09\u548c\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff08\u7ea625%-50%\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCNL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u51b2\u7a81\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3001\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u5c0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b7\u548c\u5df2\u638c\u63e1\u96c6\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6d88\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aLLMs\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c31\u5730\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u51fa\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea659.1%-81.7%\uff1b\u8986\u76d65\u4e2aLLM\u30014\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u30014\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0cCNL\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u793a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6CORDS\uff0c\u5c06\u96c6\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u573a\uff0c\u5728\u573a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u56de\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u5c0f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u586b\u5145\u8868\u793a\u6216\u5fc5\u987b\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORDS\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u573a\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b57\u6bb5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u56de\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u6620\u5c04\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u635f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5927\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u586b\u5145\u3001\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u5927\u5c0f\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains.

Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii.

We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "SENDAI \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4eff\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u573a\uff1b\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684 MODIS \u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u65ad\u53cb\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u800c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6 SENDAI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7531\u4eff\u771f\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7ea0\u6b63\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u4ee5\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u7403\u516d\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684 MODIS \u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u573a\u4e0a\uff0cSENDAI \u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c SSIM \u63d0\u5347\u8fbe 185%\uff0c\u8f83\u8fd1\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6 36%\uff1b\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u6e05\u6670\u548c\u4e9a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6536\u76ca\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u5c0f\u6539\u52a8\uff1a\u5bf9\u671f\u671b\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0IPS-GRPO\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u8fd4\u56de\u76ee\u6807\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u5cf0\u7ed3\u679c\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u653e\u5927\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u4e24\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u968f\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5206\u5316\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\uff08IPS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u9891\u6b21\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u5c06IPS\u5e94\u7528\u4e3aGRPO\u7684drop-in\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5f62\u6210IPS-GRPO\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cIPS-GRPO\u51cf\u5c0f\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u6301\u5e73\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea0\u6b63\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff1bIPS-GRPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.\n  We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.\n  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \\textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$.

Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute.

Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training.

We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e Wishart \u6295\u5f71\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1 DP\uff1b\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u4e3a\u96f6\u65f6\u4e0d DP\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u540e\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u5927/\u5c0f\u79e9\u60c5\u5f62\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ea\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd8\u8868\u660e LoRA \u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u6b64\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u5929\u7136\u79c1\u6709\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u79c1\u6709\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30 Wishart \u6295\u5f71\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0e\u5b9e\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982 LoRA\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa S \u2192 M f(S)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d M \u223c W_d(1/r I_d, r)\u3002\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1 DP \u7684\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed9\u51fa\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u5426\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5927/\u5c0f\u79e9\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4ec5\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5c06 LoRA \u7b49\u66f4\u65b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u8be5\u77e9\u9635\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f4e\u79e9\u4e0e\u5168\u79e7\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7528\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "- \u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff1aWishart \u6295\u5f71\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002 \n- \u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\uff1a\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u5177\u5907 DP\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8 AUC \u7684\u6210\u5458\u8d44\u683c\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u3002 \n- \u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u5f62\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u79e9\u4e0e\u5c0f\u79e9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u5747\u6539\u5584\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002 \n- LoRA \u5173\u8054\uff1aLoRA \u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u8be5\u77e9\u9635\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u4f46\u5355\u9760\u5176\u5185\u7f6e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u5929\u751f\u79c1\u6709\uff0c\u4e14\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u5177\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002 \n- \u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6240\u9700\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Wishart \u6295\u5f71\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5de5\u5177\u5177\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u73b0 DP\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u501f\u52a9\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\u3002\u6b64\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982 LoRA\uff09\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa KVW\uff08Knowledge Vector Weakening\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5fd8\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u524a\u5f31\u5fd8\u5374\u96c6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fd8\u5374\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u5fd8\u5374\u548c LoRA \u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5fd8\u8bb0-\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5fd8\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 LVLMs \u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5fd8\u5374\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Knowledge Vector Weakening\uff08KVW\uff09\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5168\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u5fd8\u8bb0\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u524a\u5f31\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528 undesirable knowledge\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MLLMU \u4e0e CLEAR \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cKVW \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0-\u4fdd\u7559\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5fd8\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c LoRA \u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "KVW \u4e3a LVLM \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u5fd8\u5374\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.\n  Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3.", "code_url": "https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3", "code_stars": 1, "code_last_update": "2026-01-29", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa DASH\uff08Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u89c6\u4f5c DAG \u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Descending Q-Tile Iteration \u4e0e Shift Scheduling \u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5728 NVIDIA H800 \u4e0a\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u541e\u5410\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u57fa\u7ebf\u76841.28\u00d7\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u9700\u4fdd\u6301\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4f1a\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97/\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u7ea6\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u540e\u5411\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe(DAG)\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6761\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) Descending Q-Tile Iteration\uff1a\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u5757\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u904d\u5386\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\uff1b2) Shift Scheduling\uff1a\u5728\u6240\u5efa DAG \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\u3002", "result": "\u5728 NVIDIA H800 \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cDASH \u53ef\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u541e\u5410\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6700\u5927 1.28 \u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff08GitHub\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u89c6\u4e3a DAG \u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0cDASH \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c0f\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5f3a\u7684 LLM \u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill.

Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals.

Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MoHETS\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684 Transformer\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u8d28\u4e13\u5bb6 MoHE \u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5c55\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u540c\u8d28 MLP \u4e13\u5bb6\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5f02\u8d28\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u5408\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1 MoHE \u5c42\uff1a\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7247\u8def\u7531\u5230\u5c11\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6df1\u5377\u79ef\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8def\u7531\u5230\u7684 Fourier \u57fa\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u4e8e\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u5377\u79ef\u7247\u6bb5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u5934\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b horizon \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 state-of-the-art\uff0c\u5e73\u5747 MSE \u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea6 12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u8d28\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u5916\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0cMoHETS \u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.\n  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems.

Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness.

This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples.

Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware.

The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality.

Panousis", "Diego Marcos"], "title": "Clarity: The Flexibility-Interpretability Trade-Off in Sparsity-aware Concept Bottleneck Models", "comment": null, "summary": "The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to \"induce interpretability\". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations.

Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation.

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets.

The Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9FID\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b dropout \u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4ef7FID\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "FID\u57fa\u4e8eImageNet pretrained\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5ea6\u5bf9FID\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b dropout \u8ba1\u7b97FID\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728ImageNet1K\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7ecf\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5dee\u53ef\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53cd\u6620FID\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eFID\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability.

Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices.

Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes.

This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds.

Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\\textbf{R}$ea$\\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize.

We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth.

The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors.

Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility.

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis.

We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives.

Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm.

Assess performance across wind regimes and UAS configurations (notably five-UAS).", "result": "Local wind RMSE (north/east): 0.064/0.062 m/s (low wind); 0.122\u20130.129 m/s (moderate); 0.271\u20130.273 m/s (high). Vertical RMSE: 0.029\u20130.091 m/s. PINN reconstruction captures dominant structures and vertical shear up to 1000 m. Mean wind RMSE under moderate wind: 0.118\u20130.154 m/s; best performance with five-UAS swarm.", "conclusion": "Coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate, scalable 4D wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure."}}

To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $\u0394t$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6 \u0394t \u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u5c0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u4e14\u5c3d\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728MLFF\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6b65\u957f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728 \u0394t \u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9010\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u53ef\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\u53ef\u7528\u79ef\u5206\u6b65\u957f\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684MLFF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u5747\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u79ef\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 MLFF \u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
