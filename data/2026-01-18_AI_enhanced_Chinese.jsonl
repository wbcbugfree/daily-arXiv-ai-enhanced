However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism.

However, their traditional manual development poses significant challenges related to scalability, consistency, and adaptability. Recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for automating and enhancing OKB development. This paper introduces a structured, iterative methodology leveraging LLMs to optimize knowledge acquisition, automate ontology artifact generation, and enable continuous refinement cycles. We demonstrate this approach through a detailed case study focused on developing a user context profile ontology within the vehicle sales domain. Key contributions include significantly accelerated ontology construction processes, improved ontological consistency, effective bias mitigation, and enhanced transparency in the ontology engineering process.

Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProUtt\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u53d1\u8bdd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u6811\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u6765\u591a\u8f6e\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u548c\u975e\u504f\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5546\u4e1aAPI\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d/\u975e\u504f\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ProUtt \u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f00\u53d1 exploitation \u4e0e exploration \u4e24\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u672a\u6765\u56de\u5408\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u4fee\u8ba2\u610f\u56fe\u6811\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u975e\u504f\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528 LLM \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cProUtt \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1aLLM API\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u5728 LLM-\u4f5c\u4e3a-\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ProUtt \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d/\u975e\u504f\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI.

However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and introduce iTIMO, a dataset specifically tailored for this purpose. We identify the lack of {\\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on iTIMO, revealing the limitations of current LLMs and lead to several valuable directions for future research.

Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5).

Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f02\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u628a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u83b7\u53d6/\u5c31\u8bca\u673a\u4f1a\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f02\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5d4c\u5165\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0e\u533b\u7597\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u533a\u5206 biases \u7684\u6765\u6e90\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u60c5\u5883\u4e0e disparities \u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u201c\u516c\u5e73\u201d\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u65e0\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0e\u533b\u7597\u5dee\u5f02\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u4ea7\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1b\u6f14\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9 fairness\u2013accuracy \u6743\u8861\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion.

Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06 GPTQ \u91cf\u5316\u3001LoRA \u9002\u914d\u548c\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u7ea6 2\u00d7 \u7684\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\uff1bMuon \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5c24\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u80fd\u8017\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e GPTQ \u7684\u540e\u91cf\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u3001LoRA \u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KL \u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c Muon \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u538b\u7f29-\u5fae\u8c03\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7ea6 2\u00d7 \u7684\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u5982\u5c06 6GB \u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u81f3 3GB\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec GPTQ \u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1bMuon \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u6297\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6574\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684 LLM \u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "SciNets\uff1a\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5411\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5e26\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684k\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6f2b\u6b65\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u673a\u5236\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e grounding \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u6df1\u66f4 diverse \u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 grounding \u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6574\u5408\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5206\u6563\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u975e\u53d7\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784 grounding \u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u672c\u5730\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u8fdb\u884c\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6 synthesis\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u67e5\u8be2\u672c\u5730\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u6599\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u732e\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u6709\u5411\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u8fde\u63a5\u540c\u4e00\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u5171\u73b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5e26\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684k\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6f2b\u6b65\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0e\u6c14\u5019\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u66f4\u6df1\u548c\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e grounding \u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u6700\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u5b88\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u56fe-LLM \u878d\u5408\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e grounding \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u53ca\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProPer\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff08DGA\u3001RGA\uff09\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u672a\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u3001\u9700\u660e\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u4e48\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u8981\u4e48\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3.", "method": "DGA\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9690\u6027\u9700\u6c42/\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7b5b\u9009\uff1bRGA\u5728\u663e\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u5177\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7f1d\u9699\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u9002\u5207\u6027\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0cProPer\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u548c\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe84%\u7684\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf.", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ef4\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u6392\u4ee5\u53ca\u663e\u6027-\u9690\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cProPer\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.", "code_url": "https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3 pipelines\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e LLaMA-3.2-3B \u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ee5 Instruct \u7248\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316 RLHF\uff1b\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u6781\u4f4e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff1bStatLLaMA \u5177\u5907\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e13\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f3a\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u578b LLM \u6784\u5efa\u84dd\u672c\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9700\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u5177\u5907\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8981\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u679c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6216 RLHF\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u6761\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a1) \u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u65e0\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u7840 FM\uff1b2) \u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u505a\u540e\u7f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3) \u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e26\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03 FM\u3002\u8986\u76d6\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u3001\u6765\u81ea\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLHF\uff09\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e13\u77e5\u3002\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5728 RLHF \u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6838\u5fc3\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u4ee5\u57fa FM \u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001SFT \u6216 RLHF \u540e\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u4ee5 LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct \u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\u5219\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u3002SFT \u53d8\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u957f\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684 RLHF \u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u6781\u4f4e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b StatLLaMA \u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e13\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\u4e14\u66f4\u4e3a\u5747\u8861\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u9886\u57df LLM \u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u84dd\u672c\uff1a\u4ece\u5177\u6307\u4ee4\u80fd\u529b\u7684 FM \u51fa\u53d1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf RLHF\u3001\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u597d\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b StatLLaMA\u3002"}}

Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Min-Seek \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u201c\u8bf1\u53d1\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u7684 KV \u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49 KV \u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u53ef\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u5177\u5907\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Min-Seek\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u5de7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49 KV \u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u601d\u8def\u524d\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u7801\u4e14\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u601d\u8def\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e14\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u952e\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7eed\u5199\u8d85\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bf1\u53d1\u601d\u8def\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u601d\u8def\u7684 KV \u5bf9\u800c\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58/\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "Min-Seek \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP.

However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies.

However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory.

We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task.

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4ece\u76f8\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e epistemic \u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u5386\u53f2\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba-\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u8865\u5145\u6027\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u4ec5\u4ee5\u540e\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a desiderata \u4e0e\u4ee3\u4ef7-\u6536\u76ca\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u8bc1\u83b7\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u5728 justificatory AI \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50 epistemic standards \u4e0e socio-technical practices \u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba-\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u8ffd\u6c42\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u636e\u6b64\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9 AI \u652f\u6491\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4fe1\u8d56\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e AI \u652f\u6491\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u7b49\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\\% of the training data.

Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage.

Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0cInception\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u6700 consistently \u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408LLM\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6587\u672c\u57df\u4ee5\u9002\u914dLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08Inception\u3001\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\u3001Transformer\u3001MLP\uff09\u5728\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u80cc\u9aa8\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Inception\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u672a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408LLM\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cInception\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u5bf9Polish\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u6210\u5c0f\u578bBERT\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8F1\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "Polish\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5Llama3.1\u5bf9Polish\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u6784\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83DistilBERT\u3001BioBERT\u3001HerBERT\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "DistilBERT\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u4e0aF1>0.80\uff0c\u81f3\u5c113\u7c7bF1>0.93\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u7ea6500x\u5c0f\u3001VRAM\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Na\u00efve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Na\u00efve RAG.

The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Single-Shot Planning for CUAs: \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u6076\u610f\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u524d\u7531\u53ef\u4fe1\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u63aa\u65bd\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u652f\u5f15\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u5728 OSWorld \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CUA\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u89c2\u5bdfUI\u72b6\u6001\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9694\u79bb\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0eUI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5355-shot\u89c4\u5212\uff08Single-Shot Planning for CUAs\uff09\uff1a\u53ef\u4fe1\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u4f55\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u652f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6267\u884c\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff1b\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5206\u652f\u5f15\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u67b6\u6784\u9694\u79bb\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u989d\u5916\u63aa\u65bd\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u652f\u5f15\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u5728 OSWorld \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u8fbe 57% \u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe 19%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728CUAs\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4fe1\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u9694\u79bb\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u652f\u5f15\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u4ecd\u9700\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}

In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with \"should not.\" We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSyntactic Framing Fragility (SFF) \u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u6781\u6027\uff08\u6b63/\u8d1f\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u5bf9LLM\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a23\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u572814\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u60c5\u666f\u4e0e4\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u201cshould not\u201d\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u6027\u6781\u5f3a\u3002\u8bf1\u5bfc\u94fe\u8def\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06SFF\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7eb3\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u91d1\u878d/\u5546\u4e1a\u60c5\u666f\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u6cd5\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u53d8\u6362\u63aa\u8f9e\uff08\u5982\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bed\u6cd5\u6781\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5bf923\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u542b\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u6b27\u6d32\u53ca\u4e2d\u56fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0f\u578b\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ea7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u572814\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u60c5\u666f\u548c4\u79cd\u53d7\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u603b\u8ba139,975\u6b21\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u6781\u6027\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\uff08LPN\uff09\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u6784\u5efaSFF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6b63\u5411\u4e0e\u8d1f\u5411\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a\u8bb8\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u56e0\u8bed\u6cd5\u6781\u6027\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u4f26\u7406 endorsements\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u662f\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u201cshould not\u201d\u65f6\uff0c80-97%\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u79ef\u6781\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002\u8bf1\u5bfc\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u5316\u7b80\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5728\u91d1\u878d/\u5546\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bd4\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4f26\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e94\u5c06SFF\u98ce\u683c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7eb3\u5165\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f13\u89e3\u624b\u6bb5\uff08\u5982\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u6620\u5c04\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u53d1\u5e03\u5728GitHub\u3002"}}

Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics.

We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.\n  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa STITCH\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u56fe\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 CAME-Bench \u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230 SOTA\uff0c\u5728 LongMemEval \u548c CAME-Bench \u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea635.6%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u8d8a\u957f\u6536\u76ca\u8d8a\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6f5c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa STITCH\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b65\u9aa4\u52a0\u4e0a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08retrieval cue\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u56fe\uff08contextual intent\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u56fe\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a1) \u5f53\u524d\u6f5c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6bb5\u843d\uff1b2) \u52a8\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b3) \u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6307\u660e\u54ea\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u68c0\u7d22\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CAME-Bench \u4e0e LongMemEval \u4e0a\uff0cSTITCH \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684 SOTA\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ea6 35.6%\uff0c\u4e14\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u8d8a\u5927\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u610f\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7d22\u5f15\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd/\u8ba1\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language.

We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Vir\u0101m benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability.

Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance.

Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required.

This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs.

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile.

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings.

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data.

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer.

However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss.

We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \\textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \\textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \\& 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6ODA\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347SFT\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7ODA-Math-460k\u548cODA-Mixture\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dSFT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u9760\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u9700\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OpenDataArena (ODA) \u7684\u503c\u951a\u5b9a\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee5\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u73af\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7ba1\u7ebf\u6784\u5efaODA-Math-460k\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7Anchor-and-Patch\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efaODA-Mixture100k/500k\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME\u548cHMMT\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cODA-Math-460k\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1bODA-Mixture\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u66f4\u5927\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\uff1bODA\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM post-training\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS.

Current research primarily focuses on binary \"detection\" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from \"detection\" to \"diagnosis\". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ece\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5411\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff08HD Task\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebfHDG\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec34B\u53c2\u6570\u7684HDM-4B-RL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728HaluEval\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHDG\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u53d7\u63a7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f2a\u9020\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6270\u52a8\u7b49\uff09\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bca\u65ad\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u3002\u4ee5HDG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3HDM-4B-RL\uff084B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b49\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728HaluEval\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u524d\u6cbf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff1bHDM-4B-RL\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bca\u65ad\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts.

Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that \"more context leads to better reasoning\".

However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations.

Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra \"History Is Not Enough\" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring.

Initial Draft of Camera-ready", "summary": "Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet.

We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy.

MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis.

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPF: a gradient-subspace-based fine-tuning method that preserves safety while maintaining utility by projecting out gradient components conflicting with a low-rank safety subspace; provides theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness against adversarial fine-tuning and jailbreak attacks.", "motivation": "Address the persistent safety-utility dilemma in LLM fine-tuning.

Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe + MoE \u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6b8b\u57fa\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u53ea\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u65b9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u5f81", "method": "\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e09\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6b8b\u57fa\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u56fe\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u4e13\u95e8\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u8bc6", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e MoE \u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5404\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u7684\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u5408 MoE \u878d\u5408\u662f\u63d0\u5347 PRL \u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u5230\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb"}}

We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound.

We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a \"classroom\" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different \"classroom sizes,\" showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions.

Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891nEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5728\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6743\u8861\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "nEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u5927\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81/\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u7c7bNMD\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5cf0\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u5f62\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u964d\u91c7\u6837/\u62bd\u6837\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6nEMG\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value \"whale\" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision.

We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality.

Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.\n  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.\n  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiasSeeker\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u5feb\u6377\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6309\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u572819\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u30013\u4e2aNTC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6d41\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5feb\u6377\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5feb\u6377\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5212\u5206\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u4e3a\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u30013\u4e2aNTC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cBiasSeeker\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6309\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u7684\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u573a\u666f\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands.

Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens.

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "GR-PCA introduces graph-based regularization into PCA to handle non-spherical noise by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward low-frequency graph Laplacian modes, thereby aligning components with conditional relationships.", "motivation": "PCA under isotropic-noise assumption can fail when features are dependent (non-spherical covariance).

The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy.

Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations.

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric.

This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%.

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility.

However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing.

Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%.

However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime.

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry.

However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy.

While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics.

Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains.

Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients.

If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training.

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoMorph \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5916\u63a8\u56de\u5f52\uff08TSER\uff09\u5728PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08CFE\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u3001\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u73b0\u6709CFE\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u6ce2\u5f62\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u751f\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7269\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa EvoMorph\uff1a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce2\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ec4PPG\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5fc3\u7387\u3001\u547c\u5438\u7387\u3001\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u53cd\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aPPG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3e\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684CFE\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoMorph \u80fd\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684CFE\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin.

This paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a domain-specialized large language model with seven billion parameters, fine-tuned for conversational understanding in Vietnamese debt collection scenarios. The proposed model integrates multiple conversational intelligence tasks, including dialogue understanding, sentiment recognition, intent detection, call stage classification, and structured slot-value extraction, within a single reasoning-based framework. We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets.

To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms.

Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively \"tames\" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Sand-Glass \u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u97f3\u8282\u7ea7\u65f6\u957f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca HOMURA \u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 KL \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u97f3\u8282\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs \u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5197\u957f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5b57\u5e55\u3001\u914d\u97f3\uff09\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u957f\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Sand-Glass \u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u8282\u7ea7\u65f6\u957f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa HOMURA\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26 KL \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u97f3\u8282\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7 Sand-Glass \u4e0e HOMURA\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u8282\u7ea7\u65f6\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u753b\u50cf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\uff0cGPT-5.2\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u597d\u4f46\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u654f\u611f\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u7b49\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u5927\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u6c47\u603b\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u4f53\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u683c\u5c40\u3002GPT-5.2\u5728\u5404\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4ecd\u8f83\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification.

This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity.

Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "GradESTC \u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5c06\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u5c11\u91cf\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0a\u4f20\u7aef\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e0a\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u538b\u7f29FedAvg\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u68af\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u8f6e\u4e2d\u4ec5\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5c11\u91cf\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u4e0a\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u53ea\u9700\u53d1\u9001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u53ca\u88ab\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u91cd\u6784\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0cGradESTC \u5c06\u4e0a\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea639.79%\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u7684FedAvg\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u68af\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548FL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cGradESTC \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.", "AI": {"tldr": "Looped Transformers (LTs) \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fed\u4ee3\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u867d\u7136\u589e\u52a0\u5faa\u73af\u6b21\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5f80\u5f80\u4f34\u968f\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u53e6\u5916\uff0cLT \u7684\u8868\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u8de8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5faa\u73af\u624d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aLTs \u867d\u5177\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u771f\u6b63\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5185\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u81ea\u7701\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83 Looped Transformers \u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5faa\u73af\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa-\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u52a0\u5faa\u73af\u6b21\u6570\u786e\u5b9e\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fe1\u606f\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u524d LT \u7684\u8868\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u672a\u968f\u5faa\u73af\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5faa\u73af\u9636\u6bb5\u624d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u3002", "conclusion": "LTs \u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6240\u9700\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3002"}}

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\".

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8bed\u5883\u6c14\u6ce1\uff08context bubble\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5305\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u951a\u70b9\u7247\u6bb5\u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u6b21\u8981 facet\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f15\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5747\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5top-k\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u9636 facet\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684 token \u9884\u7b97\u5185\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7247\u6bb5\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u951a\u70b9\u7247\u6bb5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e26\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4ea7\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u8986\u76d6\u6b21\u8981 facets\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f15\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u90fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u4efb\u4e00\u9879\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e14\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5305\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684 top-k \u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u5f15\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models.

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728 CBM \u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08PG-CBM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u91ca\u4ecb\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u8868\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa PG-CBM\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u7edf CBM \u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5730\u8868\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08above-ground biomass density\uff09\u4ece\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cPG-CBM \u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u4ece\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee3\u8868\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5411\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1 AI \u7684\u8fc8\u8fdb\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3002"}}

While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \\footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST", "code_url": "https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST", "code_stars": 16, "code_last_update": "2026-01-15", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165 MoST\uff08Mixture of Speech and Text\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff08MAMoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u540c\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728 ASR\u3001TTS\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53e3\u8bed\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MAMoE\uff1a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u540c\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u8def\u7531\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 MoE \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9762\u5411 ASR/TTS \u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u6574\u5957\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ASR\u3001TTS\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53e3\u8bed\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMoST \u5728\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5404\u9886\u57df\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u636e\u79f0\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e MoE \u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c LLM\u3002", "conclusion": "MoST \u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728 MoE \u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c LLM\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

By embedding combinatorial optimization oracles into learning pipelines, COAML enables the construction of policies that are both data-driven and feasibility-preserving, bridging the traditions of machine learning, operations research, and stochastic optimization. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in COAML. We introduce a unifying framework for COAML pipelines, describe their methodological building blocks, and formalize their connection to empirical cost minimization. We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure. Using this taxonomy, we review algorithmic approaches for static and dynamic problems, survey applications across domains such as scheduling, vehicle routing, stochastic programming, and reinforcement learning, and synthesize methodological contributions in terms of empirical cost minimization, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Finally, we identify key research frontiers. This survey aims to serve both as a tutorial introduction to the field and as a roadmap for future research at the interface of combinatorial optimization and machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9COAML\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u5e8f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u65e2\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53c8\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOAML\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7ec4\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8c03\u67e5\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5982\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7efc\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86COAML\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u73b0\u72b6\u7efc\u8ff0\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u8981\u70b9\u3001\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u6559\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "COAML\u6b63\u6210\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6210\u719f\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u57df\u3001\u5b8c\u5584\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5e76\u6df1\u5316\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data.

An enhanced version was accepted for oral presentation at the AI for Time Series Analysis Workshop at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ProbFM \u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e transformer \u7684\u6982\u7387\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e DER \u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff08 epistemic \u4e0e aleatoric \uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540c\u4e00 LSTM \u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4e94\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cDER \u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u907f\u514d\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef principled \u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7 DER \u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u8bc1\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ProbFM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6c\u5316\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u8bc1\u636e\u56de\u5f52\uff08DER\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9884\u8bbe\u5206\u5e03\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u540c\u4e00 LSTM \u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e94\u79cd probabilistic \u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DER\u3001Gaussian NLL\u3001Student's-t NLL\u3001Quantile Loss\u3001Conformal Prediction\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u7167\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "DER \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684 epistemic-aleatoric \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e DER \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b DER \u7684\u5206\u89e3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u9762\u5411 foundation \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a DER \u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Nair"], "title": "Data-driven stochastic reduced-order modeling of parametrized dynamical systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training.

We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u6bb5Token\u9009\u62e9\uff08T3S\uff09\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 Token \u7ea7\u522b\u91cd\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u201c\u6a21\u4eff\u951a\u70b9\u201dToken \u4e0e\u5c1a\u672a\u5b66\u4e60Token \u7684\u5171\u5b58\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u84b8\u998f\u5f80\u5f80\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u751a\u81f3\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\u5904\u540c\u65f6\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51faToken\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u5728Token\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection\uff08T3S\uff09\uff0c\u6309 Token \u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u5df2\u5feb\u901f\u951a\u5b9a\u7684 Imitation-Anchor Tokens \u4e0e\u5c1a\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 Token\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u91c7\u6837/\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c1a\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 Token \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e24\u7c7b Token \u4e0d\u80fd\u5171\u5b58\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52(AR)\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03(dLLM)\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\uff0cQwen3-8B \u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7 DeepSeek-R1\uff0cQwen3-32B \u9760\u8fd1 Qwen3-235B\uff0cT3 \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 LLaDA-2.0-Mini \u8d85\u8fc7 AR \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709 16B \u89c4\u6a21\u201c\u65e0\u601d\u8003\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Token \u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u8fde\u7eed\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8 AR \u4e0e dLLM \u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u6ede\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff08staleness-bucket aggregation with padding\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u7684IPM\u98ce\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u66f4\u65b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u5185\u52a0\u6743\u9519\u4f8b\u7d2f\u8ba1\u7684\u671f\u671b\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f71\u54cd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u6ede\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u566a\u58f0\u8d21\u732e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u65f6\u57df\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9879\uff1b\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5728\u65b0\u9c9c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8054\u90a6/\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u94fe\u8def\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7ed9\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790staleness-bucket aggregation with padding\uff1b\u5728margin separability\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u534a\u5f84\u6709\u754c\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u671f\u671b\u9519\u4f8b\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u522b\u5217\u51fa\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u6ede\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u968f\u65f6\u57df\u589e\u5927\u800c\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u91cf\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u9c9c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u671f\u671b\u52a0\u6743\u9519\u4f8b\u7d2f\u79ef\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u7531\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u6ede\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u4e3a\u968f\u65f6\u57df\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u589e\u957f\u4e14\u4e0e\u603b\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u6ede\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed9\u51fa\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u65b0\u9c9c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an \"Assistant Axis,\" which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts \"persona drift,\" a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9886\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u201cAssistant Axis\u201d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u7269\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6cbf\u8be5\u8f74\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u53ef\u653e\u5927\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\uff0c\u800c\u504f\u79bb\u4f1a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u52a9\u624b\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u504f\u79bb\u751a\u81f3\u51fa\u73b0\u795e\u79d8\u98ce\u683c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8be5\u8f74\u4e0a\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u589e\u7a33\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u4eba\u683c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u52ab\u6301\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u951a\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e3a\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u6216\u602a\u5f02\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u5b9a\u4eba\u683c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u539f\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5bfb\u627e\u4eba\u683c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u5148\u6210\u5206\uff08\u4e3b\u6210\u5206/\u8f74\u7ebf\uff09\u5f62\u6210\u201cAssistant Axis\u201d\uff1b\u5bf9\u8be5\u8f74\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u63a7\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7269\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff1b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u2018persona drift\u2019\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4fc3\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9650\u5b9a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u201cAssistant Axis\u201d\uff1b\u5411\u8be5\u8f74\u9760\u8fd1\u589e\u5f3a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u52a9\u624b\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0e\u65e0\u5bb3\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u8fdc\u79bb\u8f74\u7ebf\u5219\u6613\u5448\u73b0\u5176\u4ed6\u5b9e\u4f53\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u504f\u79bb\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u5448\u73b0\u795e\u79d8\u5316\u3001\u620f\u5267\u5316\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u8be5\u8f74\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4fc3\u6210\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\uff08\u5982\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u6559\u7ec3\uff09\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u7075\u6027\u5316\u98ce\u683c\uff1b\u6cbf\u8f74\u7ebf\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u201cpersona drift\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b drift \u5e38\u7531\u9700\u8981\u5143\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6216\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0a\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\uff1b\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8f74\u7ebf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u52ab\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u5f62\u6210\u5f3a\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\uff1b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f74\u7ebf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u533a\u57df\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u624b\u6bb5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u6b65\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684 personas \u6838\u5fc3\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \\emph{high-quality} samples.\n  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \\emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \\emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u63d2\u503c\u6cd5( collocation )\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c1/epsilon\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5448\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7(polylog)\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u88ab\u964d\u81f3\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8fd9\u662f\u5728\u4ec5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6570\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6(diffusion-based)\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9006\u6b21\u65b9\u5448\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f4e\u9636\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u63d2\u503c/ collocation \u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6570\uff08scores\uff09\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6784\u9020\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u5bf91/epsilon\u4ec5\u5448\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4ec5\u7ecf\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u4f20\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9 diffusion \u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\uff1a\u5728\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5206\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e1/epsilon\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u518d\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u9879\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e collocation \u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5728 score-based \u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation.

However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment.

Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning.

Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa AEQ-Bench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30 omni-modal \u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u97f3\u9891+\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u7406\u5fc3 judgement\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5177\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa AEQ-Bench\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff08\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8bb2\u8bdd\u8bed\u6c14\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u97f3/paralinguistic \u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5177\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u7684 OLMs\u3002", "result": "\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u7684 OLMs \u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u8fbe\uff08paralinguistic\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "AEQ-Bench \u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d OLMs \u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6 paralinguistic \u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses.

In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence.

These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same.

We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding.

Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa LIBERTy \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5e72\u9884\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b(SCM)\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6cbf SCM \u4f20\u64ad\u76f4\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u7167\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b LIBERTy \u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001CV \u7b5b\u67e5\u3001 workplace violence \u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807 order-faithfulness\u3002\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u672a\u8fbe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u4e13\u6709 LLM \u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "LIBERTy \u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5fe0\u8bda\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6025\u9700\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.
