### [1] [From Chaos to Clarity: Schema-Constrained AI for Auditable Biomedical Evidence Extraction from Full-Text PDFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14267)
*Pouria Mortezaagha,Joseph Shaw,Bowen Sun,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Schema-constrained, provenance-aware AI extraction system converts full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records with typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. It uses resume-aware hashing, caption-aware chunking, asynchronous processing, and conflict-aware consolidation to ensure traceability. Demonstrated on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) studies with full automation, stable throughput, and consistent chunk-level outputs; iterative schema refinement improved key variables like assay classification and follow-up timing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical evidence synthesis requires accurate extraction of methods, labs, and outcomes from complex PDFs. OCR errors, document fragmentation, limited throughput, and poor auditability hinder scalable synthesis; a schema-driven, provenance-aware extraction approach aims to improve accuracy, scalability, and traceability.

Method: Ingest documents with resume-aware hashing; partition into caption-aware page-level chunks; process asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls; merge chunk outputs into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance for auditability.

Result: The pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and showed strong internal consistency across chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for critical variables (assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, timing of measurement).

Conclusion: Schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable, auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Biomedical evidence synthesis relies on accurate extraction of methodological, laboratory, and outcome variables from full-text research articles, yet these variables are embedded in complex scientific PDFs that make manual abstraction time-consuming and difficult to scale. Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement. These results demonstrate that schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable and auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning modern document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.

### [2] [The Slow Drift of Support: Boundary Failures in Multi-Turn Mental Health LLM Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14269)
*Youyou Cheng,Zhuangwei Kang,Kerry Jiang,Chenyu Sun,Qiyang Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个多轮压力测试框架来评估大语言模型在精神健康场景下的安全性，揭示单轮测试掩盖的边界侵蚀问题；自适应探测延迟边界跨越但总体违规率相近，且防守边界脆弱性随对话长度增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全评估多聚焦单轮对话的禁止词检测，无法捕捉多轮对话中安全边界的逐渐侵蚀，尤其在提供安抚和共情时边界更易被突破。

Method: 设计50个虚拟患者档案，对三个前沿LLMs进行多轮对话测试，使用静态进阶和自适应探测两种压力方式，每个模型最多20轮对话；评估边界违规事件及达到边界的时间点（对话轮次）。

Result: 违规事件普遍发生；两种压力模式下违规率相近；但自适应探测显著延缓边界跨越的时间，平均轮次从9.21（静态）降至4.64；在两种机制下，作出决定性或零风险承诺是主要违规方式；单轮测试不足以评估安全边界的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调需要在扩展对话情境中考察安全边界的磨损，构建多轮压力测试框架以更真实地评估精神健康辅助场景下LLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for mental health support. However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.
  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本综述提出以七问框架揭示大语言模型多步推理的机制，连接隐含激活中的隐性推理与外显的口述推理，并提出五条未来机制研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有综述多聚焦工程改进，缺乏对大语言模型多步推理背后机制的系统化理解；需要澄清内部表征与推理过程的关系。

Method: 以七个相互关联的研究问题为核心的概念框架，对现有文献进行整合分析，考察从隐藏激活中的隐性多跳推理到口述推理如何重塑内部计算。

Result: 提出一个统一的机制框架，汇总并对比了证据，揭示隐含表示如何支撑多步推理，以及口述推理如何改变内部计算；并明确跨层次的研究重点。

Conclusion: 提出五条未来的机制研究方向，用于推动对LLM多步推理的深入理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to solve problems requiring multiple reasoning steps, yet the internal mechanisms enabling such capabilities remain elusive. Unlike existing surveys that primarily focus on engineering methods to enhance performance, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying LLM multi-step reasoning. We organize the survey around a conceptual framework comprising seven interconnected research questions, from how LLMs execute implicit multi-hop reasoning within hidden activations to how verbalized explicit reasoning remodels the internal computation. Finally, we highlight five research directions for future mechanistic studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 以评审-反驳对话为来源的 15K 人工验证问答对，构建大规模面向学术论文理解的基准 RPC-Bench，评估模型在 why/what/how 等学术问题上的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对学术论文细粒度、规模化评估；基础模型在专业科学话语和复杂图表上的理解能力尚不充分；需要对学术研究流程的理解进行系统评估。

Method: 数据集构建、面向科研流程的细粒度 taxonomy（why/what/how）、LLM−人类交互注释框架、LLM 作为评审的标注与质量控制框架、评估框架的 correctness-completeness 与 conciseness、对比人类判定、高一致性、使用 GPT-5 等模型进行基线评估。

Result: GPT-5 达成 68.2% 的 correctness-completeness，conciseness 调整后降至 37.46%；数据与代码公开；在高质量论文评审-反驳文本中覆盖 15K QA，对模型理解学术论文的能力提出挑战。

Conclusion: RPC-Bench 提供可扩展的学术文本理解评估框架，揭示当前强模型在学术论文理解上的显著差距；未来可扩展至更多学科、完善注释与评估框架、提升对复杂论文的理解与推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding research papers remains challenging for foundation models due to specialized scientific discourse and complex figures and tables, yet existing benchmarks offer limited fine-grained evaluation at scale. To address this gap, we introduce RPC-Bench, a large-scale question-answering benchmark built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs. We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding. Our code and data are available at https://rpc-bench.github.io/.

### [5] [Project Aletheia: Verifier-Guided Distillation of Backtracking for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14290)
*Aradhya Dixit,Tianxi Liang,Jai Telang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过 Verifier-Guided Distillation 在 7B 模型上训练，利用包含错误与自我修正的验证推理轨迹，使小型语言模型具备错误修复与回溯的潜在能力，从而在严格约束问题上提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在私有化、设备端部署具有吸引力，但在严格约束问题上频繁失败，原因是推断链条线性且过度自信，无法从早期错误中恢复，需降低对大模型依赖。训练出具备错误修复能力的推理行为有助于改进可解释性与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出 Verifier-Guided Distillation 训练协议，将错误修复过程（显式的冲突检测和回溯）转移到训练目标上，而不仅仅是对最终答案进行正确性优化。以 7B 模型为对象，使用包含错误与自我纠正的已验证推理轨迹进行训练。

Result: 在小型模型中显现潜在的验证行为，模型能够在必要时停下、检测矛盾并修正先前的假设，表现出对错误的自我纠正能力的初步迹象。

Conclusion: 通过在反馈轨迹中引入验证/回溯机制，可在小型语言模型中诱导类似验证的推理能力，从而提升对错误的修复能力和对严格约束问题的处理鲁棒性，开启对可控推理的可行路径。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, under 10B parameters) are attractive for private, on-device deployment, yet they frequently fail on strict constraint-satisfaction problems due to linear, overconfident reasoning traces that do not recover from early mistakes. We introduce Verifier-Guided Distillation, a training protocol that transfers the process of error repair - explicit conflict detection and backtracking - rather than only correct final answers. By training a 7B model on verified reasoning traces that include mistakes and self-corrections, we show that latent verification behavior can emerge in small models, enabling them to occasionally stop, detect contradictions, and revise earlier assumptions.

### [6] [Guided by the Plan: Enhancing Faithful Autoregressive Text-to-Audio Generation with Guided Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14304)
*Juncheng Wang,Zhe Hu,Chao Xu,Siyue Ren,Yuxiang Feng,Yang Liu,Baigui Sun,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR文本到音频生成在按复杂提示方面存在对齐不足的问题。研究发现早期前缀令牌中隐含全局语义属性（如事件计数、声源类别），并提出Plan-Critic，通过GAE灵感的目标来预测部分生成的最终指令遵循质量，以引导推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归音频生成在复杂文本提示下对全局语义的遵循能力不足的问题，揭示前缀对全局规划的潜在作用。

Method: 发现前缀令牌编码全局属性的现象；提出Plan-Critic——一个轻量级辅助模型，训练时使用GAE-inspired目标以从部分生成预测最终质量；推理时对候选前缀进行评估、剪枝低质量轨迹，并将计算资源重新分配给高潜力的规划种子。

Result: Plan-Critic-guided采样在CLAP分数上比AR基线提高约10分，达到自回归文本到音频生成的新SOTA；且计算成本维持在与标准best-of-N解码相当的水平。

Conclusion: 将因果生成与全局语义对齐桥接，证明严格自回归模型也具备前瞻性规划能力，Plan-Critic提供了一种将规划纳入自回归生成的有效框架。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.

### [7] [Quantifying Speaker Embedding Phonological Rule Interactions in Accented Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14417)
*Thanathai Lertpetchpun,Yoonjeong Lee,Thanapat Trachu,Jihwan Lee,Tiantian Feng,Dani Byrd,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Combining linguistically motivated phonological rules with speaker embeddings improves accent control in TTS and reveals entanglement between accent and speaker identity; introduces PSR metric to measure rule preservation vs. override.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and controllability of accent generation in TTS by leveraging explicit phonological rules rather than relying solely on speaker embeddings.

Method: Implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences for American vs British English; analyze interaction with speaker embeddings; introduce PSR metric; conduct experiments comparing rule-only, embedding-only, and combined approaches.

Result: Combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents; embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules; PSR quantifies the degree of preservation/override; show entanglement between accent and speaker identity; rules act as lever for accent control; framework for evaluating disentanglement.

Conclusion: Rules provide interpretable control; they facilitate disentanglement evaluation; embeddings can both help and hinder; future work on leveraging rules for controllable TTS.

Abstract: Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.

*Sasha Ronaghi,Emma-Louise Aveling,Maria Levis,Rachel Lauren Ross,Emily Alsentzer,Sara Singer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个模型-与任务无关的框架，将人机LLM结合用于定性分析，在多点糖尿病护理研究中应用于研究者摘要的定性综合和167份访谈稿的演绎编码，提高效率并保持研究严谨性，为未来在健康服务研究中的应用提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏将LLM融入定性分析的系统方法论指南，以及关于其在现实研究中对方法和结果影响的证据。需提升大规模多地点健康服务研究的分析效率，同时保持严谨性。

Method: 开发一个模型-和任务无关的框架，用于设计人-LLM定性分析方法，以支持不同的分析目标。在一项关于在FQHC的糖尿病护理的多点研究中，基于该框架实现了两种人-LLM方法：(1) 研究者生成摘要的定性综合以产生对比反馈报告；(2) 167份访谈稿的演绎编码以完善一项实践转型干预。

Result: LLM辅助实现对来自研究团队的及时反馈，并将大规模定性数据纳入理论与实践变革的依据。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了将LLMs整合到应用于健康服务研究中的可能性，以提升效率并保持研究的严谨性，为在定性研究中的持续创新提供指引。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for improving the efficiency of qualitative analysis in large, multi-site health-services research. Yet methodological guidance for LLM integration into qualitative analysis and evidence of their impact on real-world research methods and outcomes remain limited. We developed a model- and task-agnostic framework for designing human-LLM qualitative analysis methods to support diverse analytic aims. Within a multi-site study of diabetes care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), we leveraged the framework to implement human-LLM methods for (1) qualitative synthesis of researcher-generated summaries to produce comparative feedback reports and (2) deductive coding of 167 interview transcripts to refine a practice-transformation intervention. LLM assistance enabled timely feedback to practitioners and the incorporation of large-scale qualitative data to inform theory and practice changes. This work demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into applied health-services research to enhance efficiency while preserving rigor, offering guidance for continued innovation with LLMs in qualitative research.

*Crish Nagarkar,Leonid Bogachev,Serge Sharoff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 精调开放源代码的大语言模型在统计任务上达到接近统计学学生水平的表现，并且在自我评估回答质量方面优于传统评估指标，显示出在教育技术和统计分析辅助系统中的潜在应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于评估大语言模型在中等到复杂统计任务中的能力，以及其对推理质量的自我评估能力尚不明确。通过微调提升统计推理能力并比较与人类基准分数，以评估其在教育与分析工具中的可应用性，并探究模型架构对性能的影响。

Method: 对若干开放源代码LLM进行针对性数据集的微调，以提升统计推理能力；将微调后模型的表现与以人类分数为基准的评估进行对比；在高级统计任务上测试模型，同时评估其对答案质量、解释与推理的自我评估能力，并将其与BLEU/BertScore等传统指标进行比较。

Result: 微调后的模型在高级统计任务上表现优于基线，达到与统计学学生相当的水平；不同模型的提升呈现架构依赖性，某些模型获得显著增益。研究还发现LLMs在自我评估答案质量方面明显优于传统评估指标，如BLEU或BertScore。

Conclusion: 微调方法显示出在教育技术与统计分析辅助系统中的部署潜力，支持面向教育平台的可扩展自动评估与分析工具的质量控制，并可用于研究方法论的验证以及数据分析工作流的质量保障。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve statistical tasks, as well as their capacity to assess the quality of reasoning. While state-of-the-art LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a range of NLP tasks, their competence in addressing even moderately complex statistical challenges is not well understood. We have fine-tuned selected open-source LLMs on a specially developed dataset to enhance their statistical reasoning capabilities, and compared their performance with the human scores used as a benchmark. Our results show that the fine-tuned models achieve better performance on advanced statistical tasks on the level comparable to a statistics student. Fine-tuning demonstrates architecture-dependent improvements, with some models showing significant performance gains, indicating clear potential for deployment in educational technology and statistical analysis assistance systems. We also show that LLMs themselves can be far better judges of the answers quality (including explanation and reasoning assessment) in comparison to traditional metrics, such as BLEU or BertScore. This self-evaluation capability enables scalable automated assessment for statistical education platforms and quality assurance in automated analysis tools. Potential applications also include validation tools for research methodology in academic and industry settings, and quality control mechanisms for data analysis workflows.

*Jinhui Liu,Ximeng Zhang,Yanbo Ai,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个面向商业逻辑的数据合成框架，用于私有 BI 场景下的 Text-to-SQL 评估，结合商业角色、工作场景与工作流，并通过商业推理复杂度控制策略来多样化分析步骤。实验在 Salesforce 数据库上显示高商业现实性与良好问答对齐，同时揭示现有模型在复杂商业查询上的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决私有 BI 场景中现实、领域特定数据稀缺的问题；通过合成数据提升 Text-to-SQL 评估的现实性与覆盖面，并与现有方法（如 OmniSQL、SQL-Factory）进行对比，评估模型在真实商业逻辑上的表现。

Method: 基于商业人物、工作情景与工作流来生成数据，并引入商业推理复杂度控制策略，以多样化解答所需的分析步骤。对一个生产规模的 Salesforce 数据库进行评估，量化数据的商业现实性与问答对齐度，并与对比方法进行性能比较。

Result: 合成数据的商业现实性达到 98.44%，明显高于 OmniSQL（+19.5%）与 SQL-Factory（+54.7%），问答与 SQL 的对齐度为 98.59%。同时，最复杂商业查询上，现有最先进的 Text-to-SQL 模型执行准确率仅为 42.86%，揭示现有模型的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效生成具有高商业现实性、与问题-SQL 的强对齐的合成数据，有助于在私有 BI 场景对 Text-to-SQL 系统进行更严格的评估。然而，现有模型在处理复杂商业查询时仍存在显著性能不足，提示需要进一步的模型改进与针对性数据设计。

Abstract: Evaluating Text-to-SQL agents in private business intelligence (BI) settings is challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, domain-specific data. While synthetic evaluation data offers a scalable solution, existing generation methods fail to capture business realism--whether questions reflect realistic business logic and workflows. We propose a Business Logic-Driven Data Synthesis framework that generates data grounded in business personas, work scenarios, and workflows. In addition, we improve the data quality by imposing a business reasoning complexity control strategy that diversifies the analytical reasoning steps required to answer the questions. Experiments on a production-scale Salesforce database show that our synthesized data achieves high business realism (98.44%), substantially outperforming OmniSQL (+19.5%) and SQL-Factory (+54.7%), while maintaining strong question-SQL alignment (98.59%). Our synthetic data also reveals that state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL models still have significant performance gaps, achieving only 42.86% execution accuracy on the most complex business queries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律领域长文摘要的事实准确性挑战；通过可验证的事实碎片（nuggets）来辅助用户评估和改写摘要。

Method: 将 nugget 基于评估的思想转化为用户端工具，开发原型系统，覆盖两种场景：在两份摘要中判定更优者；对自动摘要进行人工改进。

Result: 提出一个面向法律领域的原型系统，展示在两个具体场景中的可行性与应用潜力，支持终端用户对摘要的评估和改进。

Conclusion: 证实 nugget 基于评估的思路具备扩展到终端用户场景的潜力，特别是在法律摘要的事实性校验与改写方面。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to summarize long documents, this trend poses significant challenges in the legal domain, where the factual accuracy of deposition summaries is crucial. Nugget-based methods have been shown to be extremely helpful for the automated evaluation of summarization approaches. In this work, we translate these methods to the user side and explore how nuggets could directly assist end users. Although prior systems have demonstrated the promise of nugget-based evaluation, its potential to support end users remains underexplored. Focusing on the legal domain, we present a prototype that leverages a factual nugget-based approach to support legal professionals in two concrete scenarios: (1) determining which of two summaries is better, and (2) manually improving an automatically generated summary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过自动执行器验证前沿LLMs产生的可执行点子并从执行反馈中学习。采用演化搜索与强化学习两条路径，在两项现实研究任务（LLM预训练与后训练）中验证可执行性与学习效果；结果显示演化搜索在样本效率和效果方面优于基线，强化学习受模式崩溃影响，提示需进一步分析执行与训练动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化AI研究潜力巨大，但当前LLMs易提出看似合理却无效的点子。通过执行层面的验证与从执行反馈中学习，可提升研究效率并检验LLMs在执行结果上的可学习性。

Method: 构建一个自动化执行器来实现点子并进行大规模GPU并行实验。将LLM的预训练与后训练问题转化为执行环境，评估在 frontier LLMs 产生的点子中可实现的比例。基于执行反馈，比较两种学习路径：演化搜索与强化学习。

Result: 演化搜索具有较高的样本效率：在后训练任务中取得比GRPO基线高出约21.4个百分点的性能（69.4% vs 48.0%），在预训练任务中缩短训练时间（19.7分钟 vs 35.9分钟），且均在仅十轮搜索内实现。 frontier LLMs往往能给出有意义的算法点子，但易在早期饱和且扩展性受限；强化学习尽管提高了执行者的平均奖励，但未提升上限，原因是模型收敛到简单点子并出现模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 执行驱动的自动化AI研究具备可行性与潜力，可快速发现有效研究路径。需要对执行的点子及训练动力学进行更深入分析，以促进未来在执行-反馈循环中的改进与稳健性提升。

Abstract: Automated AI research holds great potential to accelerate scientific discovery. However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对偏见的对抗性推理能力类似于人类：单纯移除偏见信息的提示常失败，给模型一个“盲复制品”的答案作为真知识源可提升公平性与透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在偏见情境下的对反事实推理能力，以及是否可通过对其认知过程的可控访问来改进决策公平性。

Method: 系统性比较不同提示策略（忽略、假装不了解偏见信息）对模型偏见的影响；引入一个盲复制品API的对比，观察是否能改善决策公平性与提供透明度。

Result: 忽略/不知偏见信息的提示有时无效甚至反效果；但给予模型对其自身对反事实认知的“ground-truth模型”访问（盲复制品的输出）可实现更公平的决策并帮助区分隐性偏见与有意偏见。

Conclusion: 利用自我认知的盲复制品作为外部真知识源，能够提升公平性和解释性，揭示隐性偏见行为。

Abstract: Fair decisions require ignoring irrelevant, potentially biasing, information. To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 社会 Caption 框架基于互动理论，用于评估多模态大语言模型的社会理解能力，覆盖社会推理（SI）、整体社会分析（HSA）与定向社会分析（DSA）三维度，通过分析规模、架构与口语上下文等因素，结合 MLLM 判断器进行可扩展的自动化评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要对多模态大语言模型的社会理解能力进行系统、理论驱动的多维度评估，以填补现有评估在理论支撑和可扩展性方面的不足。

Method: 提出 Social Caption 框架，定义 SI、HSA、DSA 三个维度；分析影响变量（规模、架构、口语上下文等），并通过基于 MLLM 的判断器进行实验以探索可扩展的评测。

Result: 该框架揭示规模、架构和口语上下文等因素对 SI/HSA/DSA 表现的影响；以 MLLM 判断器的实验提供关于自动化评估可扩展性的重要洞察。

Conclusion: Social Caption 提供一个以互动理论为基础的社会理解评估框架，有助于系统评估 MLLMs 的社会理解能力，并指向实现可扩展自动化评估的路径。

Abstract: Social understanding abilities are crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret human social interactions. We introduce Social Caption, a framework grounded in interaction theory to evaluate social understanding abilities of MLLMs along three dimensions: Social Inference (SI), the ability to make accurate inferences about interactions; Holistic Social Analysis (HSA), the ability to generate comprehensive descriptions of interactions; Directed Social Analysis (DSA), the ability to extract relevant social information from interactions. We analyze factors influencing model performance in social understanding, such as scale, architectural design, and spoken context. Experiments with MLLM judges contribute insights about scaling automated evaluation of multimodal social understanding.

### [15] [Say Anything but This: When Tokenizer Betrays Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14658)
*Navid Ayoobi,Marcus I Armstrong,Arjun Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows tokenization artifacts in LLMs can mislead reasoning; introduces a tokenization-consistency probe; analyzes 11k trials across open-source LLMs; uncovers phantom edits and 8 artifact categories; argues for tokenizer-level remedies before larger model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern subword tokenizers produce non-unique encodings where different token ID sequences map to the same surface string, creating a representational mismatch that can cause fragile reasoning and misalignment between internal representations and text semantics.

Method: Develops a tokenization-consistency probe that asks models to replace specific target words in a context while keeping all other content fixed. Evaluates over 11,000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to identify cases where outputs appear to reason correctly but are affected by tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts. Analyzes errors to categorize eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, such as whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation.

Result: Found a non-trivial rate of phantom edits where models maintain surface-level plausibility but underlying reasoning is altered due to tokenizer-induced representational differences. Identified eight artifact categories and described their patterns and prevalence across models and tasks.

Conclusion: Tokenizer artifacts contribute to apparent reasoning deficiencies. Recommends tokenizer-level remedies and careful evaluation of tokenization effects before scaling up model size or data, to improve robustness of reasoning and reduce phantom-edit failures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) reason over discrete token ID sequences, yet modern subword tokenizers routinely produce non-unique encodings: multiple token ID sequences can detokenize to identical surface strings. This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct "words" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.

### [16] [AdaTIR: Adaptive Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14696)
*Zhaiyu Fang,Ruipeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaTIR shifts tool use from static invocation to difficulty-aware internalized reasoning, reducing tool calls significantly while preserving or improving accuracy, and introduces Clipped Advantage Shaping to fix sign reversal; achieves strong results including AIME 2024 with tool access disabled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses cognitive offloading in tool-augmented LLMs by enabling adaptive tool usage based on task difficulty, ensuring efficiency is a constraint while correctness remains the primary objective.

Method: Introduce a difficulty-aware efficiency reward and dynamic tool budgets, enabling internalization of reasoning for simple tasks and selective tool invocation for complex tasks. Identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties can outweigh correctness rewards, and propose Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS) to align incentives so correctness dominates while efficiency is constrained.

Result: Tool calls are reduced by up to 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex tasks; accuracy is maintained or improved. Notably, AdaTIR outperforms baselines and achieves a 4.8% gain on AIME 2024 even when tool access is strictly disabled.

Conclusion: AdaTIR demonstrates that adaptive, difficulty-aware internalization of reasoning plus CAS can yield substantial tool-efficiency gains without sacrificing accuracy, offering a robust path for next-generation tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current agents tend to exhibit cognitive offloading, redundantly invoking external tools even for simple tasks. In this paper, we suggest that true agentic intelligence requires not just tool invocation, but the adaptive wisdom to discern when to use them. We propose AdaTIR, a framework that shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to difficulty-aware reasoning internalization. By introducing a difficulty-aware efficiency reward, AdaTIR dynamically adjusts tool budgets based on task complexity--internalizing reasoning for simple tasks while selectively invoking tools for complex tasks. Furthermore, we identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties outweigh correctness rewards, mistakenly penalizing correct rollouts with negative advantages. To resolve this, we propose Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS), which ensures that correctness remains the primary objective while using efficiency as a secondary constraint. Empirical results demonstrate that AdaTIR reduces tool calls by up to 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex challenges while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Notably, AdaTIR successfully internalizes reasoning, outperforming baselines by 4.8% on AIME 2024 even when tool access is strictly disabled.

### [17] [ClaimDB: A Fact Verification Benchmark over Large Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14698)
*Michael Theologitis,Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu,Chirag Shah,Dan Suciu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimDB 提供了一个以大规模结构化数据为证据的事实核验基准；在此规模下，基于“阅读”证据的做法效果有限，需转向可执行程序的推理；现有模型普遍未超 83% 的准确率，且易于 abstention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核验基准多以文本证据为主，难以覆盖来自大规模结构化数据库的证据来源，且缺乏对从多个表和记录组合推理的评估。

Method: 构建 ClaimDB：80 个真实数据库，覆盖治理、医疗、媒体、教育、自然科学等领域；证据来自数百万条记录和多张表；评估 30 种最先进的专有和开源语言模型（<70B 参数），比较准确率与 abstention 能力。

Result: 当前模型表现普遍不理想，均未超过 83% 的准确率；超过一半模型低于 55%；闭源与开源模型在 abstention（承认无证据时停止判断）方面均存在欠缺，影响高风险数据分析的可靠性。

Conclusion: 需要以可执行程序的推理来处理结构化证据， ClaimDB 将推动相关研究与评测；基准、代码和排行榜对推动改进具有促进作用。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in fact-verification benchmarks, claims grounded in large-scale structured data remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce ClaimDB, the first fact-verification benchmark where the evidence for claims is derived from compositions of millions of records and multiple tables. ClaimDB consists of 80 unique real-life databases covering a wide range of domains, from governance and healthcare to media, education and the natural sciences. At this scale, verification approaches that rely on "reading" the evidence break down, forcing a timely shift toward reasoning in executable programs. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source (below 70B) LLMs and find that none exceed 83% accuracy, with more than half below 55%. Our analysis also reveals that both closed- and open-source models struggle with abstention -- the ability to admit that there is no evidence to decide -- raising doubts about their reliability in high-stakes data analysis. We release the benchmark, code, and the LLM leaderboard at https://claimdb.github.io .

### [18] [DARL: Encouraging Diverse Answers for General Reasoning without Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14700)
*Chongxuan Huang,Lei Lin,Xiaodong Shi,Wenping Hu,Ruiming Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 DARL 框架，通过在与参考答案保持受控偏离的前提下促进多样性输出，同时保持对齐，兼容现有通用强化学习方法，解决 RLVR/RLPR 的过拟合风险，在十三个基准上实现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如 RLVR 依赖领域验真器，难以扩展到开放/general 域；RLPR 虽扩展到通用域，但易过拟合参考答案，限制输出多样性，尤其在开放任务（如写作）中。需要在不依赖额外验证器的前提下提升输出多样性与推理能力。

Method: 提出 DARL，鼓励在参考答案的受控偏离范围内产生多样性答案，同时保留与参考的对齐；与现有通用 RL 方法完全兼容，无需新增验真器；通过在奖励或约束中引入多样性约束来实现。

Result: 在十三个基准上进行广泛实验，DARL 持续提升推理性能，与 RLPR 比肩甚至超越。对六个推理基准平均提升约 1.3 点，对七个通用基准平均提升约 9.5 点，显示在推理准确性与输出多样性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: DARL 能在不增加外部验真器的情况下提升输出多样性与推理准确性，并可无缝整合进现有强化学习管线，缓解对参考答案的过拟合，具备良好的通用性与实证效用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated promising gains in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its dependence on domain-specific verifiers significantly restricts its applicability to open and general domains. Recent efforts such as RLPR have extended RLVR to general domains, enabling training on broader datasets and achieving improvements over RLVR. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their tendency to overfit to reference answers, which constrains the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks such as writing, where multiple plausible answers exist. To address this, we propose DARL, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning framework that encourages the generation of diverse answers within a controlled deviation range from the reference while preserving alignment with it. Our framework is fully compatible with existing general reinforcement learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated without additional verifiers. Extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in reasoning performance. Notably, DARL surpasses RLPR, achieving average gains of 1.3 points on six reasoning benchmarks and 9.5 points on seven general benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both reasoning accuracy and output diversity.

### [19] [Render-of-Thought: Rendering Textual Chain-of-Thought as Images for Visual Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14750)
*Yifan Wang,Shiyu Li,Peiming Li,Xiaochen Yang,Yang Tang,Zheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 RoT 框架，将推理步骤渲染为图像，并通过 VLM 的视觉编码器对齐文本与视觉空间，实现推理过程的可分析性、3-4x 的 token 压缩与显著加速，在不额外预训练的前提下与现有方法保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Chain-of-Thought 在推理文本上的冗长性导致的高计算开销，以及对中间推理过程缺乏监督和可分析性的问题。通过将推理链可视化以便显式、可追踪地监督推理过程。

Method: 提出 Render-of-Thought (RoT) 框架：将文本推理步骤渲染成图像，利用现有 Vision-Language Models 的视觉编码器作为语义锚点，将视觉嵌入与文本空间对齐，具备即插即用且无需额外预训练。

Result: 在数学与逻辑推理基准上实现 3-4x 的 token 压缩与显著的推理加速，相较显式 CoT 保持竞争力，验证了该范式的可行性。

Conclusion: RoT 将推理链以图像形式呈现并在视觉-文本对齐框架中进行解析，提供一种可分析、低开销的推理范式，具备良好的扩展性与解释性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT

*Anqi Li,Yuqian Chen,Yu Lu,Zhaoming Chen,Yuan Xie,Zhenzhong Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsyFIRE 框架+ RECAP 两阶段模型；构建含 13 种抗拒行为的 ClientResistance 数据集；在中文文本咨询中实现高性能且具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 NLP 对抗拒分类过于简单化、忽视治疗干预的时序性、缺乏可解释性；需要细粒度、可解释的抗拒检测以改善临床关系与干预。

Method: 建立 13 种细粒度抗拒行为与协作互动的理论框架 PsyFIRE；基于该框架构建含 23,930 条标注话语与上下文依据的 ClientResistance 数据集；在此基础上提出 RECAP 的两阶段模型，用于抗拒检测及细粒度类别识别并给出解释。

Result: RECAP 在区分合作/抗拒上达到 91.25% F1；在细粒度类别上达到 66.58% macro-F1；相较领先的提示式大模型基线提升超过 20 点。应用于另一数据集与 62 名辅导员的试点研究，揭示抗拒的流行程度及对治疗关系的负面影响，显示提升辅导员理解与干预策略的潜力。

Conclusion: PsyFIRE 与 RECAP 提供更好的人机可解释性与检测效果，数据集与模型具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing and navigating client resistance is critical for effective mental health counseling, yet detecting such behaviors is particularly challenging in text-based interactions. Existing NLP approaches oversimplify resistance categories, ignore the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and offer limited interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we propose PsyFIRE, a theoretically grounded framework capturing 13 fine-grained resistance behaviors alongside collaborative interactions. Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations.
  RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies.

### [21] [Comparative Study of Large Language Models on Chinese Film Script Continuation: An Empirical Analysis Based on GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14826)
*Yuxuan Cao,Zida Yang,Ye Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对53部中国经典电影的续写基准进行跨模型评估，比较GPT-5.2与Qwen-Max-Latest在结构保留、整体质量与风格一致性等方面的表现。GPT-5.2在结构与质量、综合评分上显著优于Qwen-Max，ROUGE-L对比小幅提升，后者在ROUGE-L略高但在结构/风格/稳定性方面落后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在创作写作领域，评估大语言模型在具有文化特定叙事任务中的能力，提供可复现的中文创作评估框架与基准，为后续模型改进提供对照。

Method: 构建53部经典电影的中文续写基准，采用“前半段到后半段”的续写范式，针对每部影片采样3次，得到303个有效样本（GPT-5.2: 157，98.7%有效；Qwen-Max: 146，91.8%有效）。评价指标包含ROUGE-L、结构相似性（Structural Similarity）以及基于大语言模型的评估（DeepSeek-Reasoner）。对144对样本进行配对比较，采用统计分析。

Result: ROUGE-L：Qwen-Max略高（0.2230 vs 0.2114，d=-0.43）。但GPT-5.2在结构保留（0.93 vs 0.75，d=0.46）、整体质量（44.79 vs 25.72，d=1.04）以及综合分（0.50 vs 0.39，d=0.84）上显著优于Qwen-Max，且整体效应量达到大效应（d>0.8）。GPT-5.2在人物一致性、语调/风格匹配与格式保持等方面表现更好；Qwen-Max在生成稳定性方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 提供一个可复现的中文创作评估框架；在电影情节续写这一具有文化专属性的任务中，GPT-5.2展现出更强的结构一致性和整体创作质量，尽管Qwen-Max在词汇/句法层面的表征略占优势，但在一致性与稳定性方面存在不足，提示未来关注点为统一性与长期一致性的提升。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative writing, their performance on culturally specific narrative tasks warrants systematic investigation. This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a "first half to second half" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).
  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d>0.8).
  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability. This study provides a reproducible framework for LLM evaluation in Chinese creative writing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 LcRL：一个语言耦合的群体相对策略优化的多语言检索增强生成框架，通过语言耦合分组抽样减少知识偏差，在奖励端引入反一致性惩罚以缓解知识冲突；在数据受限和跨大规模语言集合检索的场景下表现竞争力，且开源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言 MRAG 中的单一回合检索与优化的“通用策略”导致的知识偏差和知识冲突问题；需要能够在多语言环境中更好地整合外部知识，并在数据稀缺和语言规模大时仍具鲁棒性。

Method: 提出 LcRL，包含语言耦合的群体相对策略优化用于策略与奖励； rollout 阶段采用语言耦合的分组采样以降低偏差；奖励模型引入辅助的反一致性惩罚以缓解知识冲突；并在训练过程中将策略和奖励对齐。

Result: 实验表明 LcRL 在多语言 MRAG 任务上具有竞争性表现；对受限训练数据和大规模语言集合的场景鲁棒性良好。

Conclusion: LcRL 能有效缓解跨语言知识偏差和冲突，提升多语言检索增强生成的性能与适用性，适用于现实场景；代码已开源。

Abstract: Multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (MRAG) requires models to effectively acquire and integrate beneficial external knowledge from multilingual collections. However, most existing studies employ a unitive process where queries of equivalent semantics across different languages are processed through a single-turn retrieval and subsequent optimization. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy is often suboptimal in multilingual settings, as the models occur to knowledge bias and conflict during the interaction with the search engine. To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict. Experimental results demonstrate that LcRL not only achieves competitive performance but is also appropriate for various practical scenarios such as constrained training data and retrieval over collections encompassing a large number of languages. Our code is available at https://github.com/Cherry-qwq/LcRL-Open.

TL;DR: PodBench is a benchmark for podcast script generation with 800 samples and long-context, multi-speaker instructions, plus a combined quantitative and LLM-based evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation resources for long-form, audio-centric podcast script generation are scarce; there is a need for a reproducible benchmark that tests long contexts and multi-speaker coordination.

Method: Construct PodBench with 800 samples, inputs up to 21k tokens, and complex multi-speaker instructions; propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that blends quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment; compare proprietary models to open-source models, including those with explicit reasoning.

Result: Proprietary models generally excel; open-source models with explicit reasoning show superior robustness in long contexts and multi-speaker coordination; high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance.

Conclusion: PodBench provides a reproducible testbed to address challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation and to study the gap between instruction following and content substance.

Abstract: Podcast script generation requires LLMs to synthesize structured, context-grounded dialogue from diverse inputs, yet systematic evaluation resources for this task remain limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce PodBench, a benchmark comprising 800 samples with inputs up to 21K tokens and complex multi-speaker instructions. We propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that integrates quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment. Extensive experiments reveal that while proprietary models generally excel, open-source models equipped with explicit reasoning demonstrate superior robustness in handling long contexts and multi-speaker coordination compared to standard baselines. However, our analysis uncovers a persistent divergence where high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance. PodBench offers a reproducible testbed to address these challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation.

TL;DR: 提出 Corpus Clarification 框架以预处理大型公民对话数据，构建 GDN-CC 数据集并验证小型开源模型在注释重现任务中的表现，最终发布大规模自动标注语料 GDN-CC-large。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升公民贡献文本在实际分析中的标准化和可用性，降低对昂贵大模型的依赖，使可在本地资源下运行的模型也能用于政治分析和主题建模。

Method: 提出 Corpus Clarification 预处理框架，将噪声化多主题贡献转化为结构化的自包含论证单元；构建人工标注的数据集 GDN-CC（1,231 条贡献，2,285 个论证单元，含论证结构注释和澄清）; 对小型语言模型进行微调并与大模型比较其在注释重现任务中的表现；评估其在观点聚类任务中的可用性；发布自动标注的 GDN-CC-large（240k 条贡献）。

Result: 微调后的小型模型在重现注释方面达到甚至超过大模型；小型模型具备用于观点聚类的可用性；GDN-CC-large 是最大的民主咨询数据集的自动标注版本。

Conclusion: 证明标准化公民贡献是可行的，且在资源受限场景下也可通过小型开源模型实现；提供有用的公共数据集，促进方法可重复性与民主数据分析的可及性。

Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand Débat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.

### [25] [A Comprehensive Benchmark of Language Models on Unicode and Romanized Sinhala](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14958)
*Minuri Rajapakse,Ruvan Weerasinghe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR:  Sinhala language model benchmark across Unicode and Romanized scripts; open-source models show strongest Unicode (Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407) and Romanized (Mistral-7B-v0.3) performance, with Llama-3.1-8B being robust across scripts, while closed-source models vary by script.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the under-exploration of LM performance on low-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala, especially for Romanized Sinhala common in digital communication. Provide guidance for practitioners selecting models and emphasize the importance of script-aware training data.

Method: Evaluate open-source models using perplexity on a diverse Unicode and Romanized Sinhala corpus; assess leading closed-source models through qualitative analysis of sentence completion across the same scripts.

Result: Key findings: Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 best for Unicode text; Mistral-7B-v0.3 best for Romanized text; Llama-3.1-8B shows strong, balanced performance for both scripts. Among closed-source models, Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel for Unicode, Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs best for Romanized Sinhala. Highlights the critical role of training data in handling script variation.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for model selection in Sinhala NLP, underscoring the need for script-aware training data and suggesting that no single model universally dominates across scripts. Results can inform deployment choices and future research on script-robust language modeling.

Abstract: The performance of Language Models (LMs) on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala remains under-explored, particularly for Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of modern LMs on a diverse corpus of Unicode and Romanized Sinhala. We evaluate open-source models using perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a text, and leading closed-source models via a qualitative analysis of sentence completion. Our findings reveal that the Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model achieves the strongest predictive performance on Unicode text and the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model for Romanized text. The results also highlight the strong all-around performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model for both scripts. Furthermore, a significant performance disparity exists among closed-source models: Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel at Unicode generation, whereas Claude-3.5-Sonnet is superior at handling Romanized text. These results provide an essential guide for practitioners selecting models for Sinhala-specific applications and highlight the critical role of training data in handling script variations.

*Chaymaa Abbas,Nour Shamaa,Mariette Awad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言污染检测在LLM评测中的重要性与可行性：阿拉伯语翻译可能掩盖传统污染信号，但对英语基准的跨语言检测揭示污染仍存在，本文提出Translation-Aware Contamination Detection以跨译版本对比信号来揭示污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有污染检测多聚焦英语基准，忽视其他语言的污染与跨语言传播，导致评估结果的公平性与可重复性受影响。需要在多语言环境下理解污染动态并开发翻译感知的评估框架。

Method: 在多语言设置下，将若干开源权重的LLM在不同比例的阿拉伯语数据上进行微调；以原始英语基准进行评估以检测记忆效应，扩展Tested Slot Guessing方法，加入选择排序策略并结合Min-K%概率分析，捕捉行为与分布层面的污染信号；提出Translation-Aware Contamination Detection，通过对比多种译本的基准信号来识别污染。

Result: 阿拉伯语翻译会抑制传统污染指标，但对具有强阿拉伯语能力的模型，暴露出污染带来的好处更明显；Mink%分数上升，跨语言答案一致性增加。Translation-Aware方法在英语单一语言方法失效时仍能可靠揭露污染。

Conclusion: 强调需要多语言、翻译感知的评估管线，以确保LLM评估的公平性、透明性与可重复性。

Abstract: Data contamination undermines the validity of Large Language Model evaluation by enabling models to rely on memorized benchmark content rather than true generalization. While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.
  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail. Together, our findings highlight the need for multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines to ensure fair, transparent, and reproducible assessment of LLMs.

TL;DR: KRPO通过知识重构驱动的提示优化框架，结合自评估、文本梯度提示优化与关系规范化记忆，提升大语言模型在开放域关系三元组抽取中的稳定性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLMs的ORTE在缺乏反思机制、对语义歧义敏感、易将错误抽取模式固化的问题；需要在不依赖固定手工提示的情况下实现持续改进。

Method: 1) 基于知识重构的自评估，将结构化三元组投射到语义一致性分数以提供内部反馈；2) 基于文本梯度的提示优化器，能够吸收历史经验并迭代优化提示以引导后续抽取任务；3) 关系规范化记忆，收集代表性关系并提供语义上不同的模式供三元组使用；4) 在三个数据集上进行大规模实验，评估抽取F1。

Result: KRPO显著优于强基线，提升抽取F1分数。

Conclusion: 通过知识重构驱动的提示优化与关系规范化记忆，实现对ORTE的持续改进与鲁棒性提升，实验结果验证其有效性。

Abstract: Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) is the foundation for mining structured knowledge without predefined schemas. Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score.

*Zhichao Yan,Yunxiao Zhao,Jiapu Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Shaoru Guo,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个基于Horn规则的全局推理评估框架LogicScore，用以克服AQA领域中对局部归因的“属性近视”。通过回溯验证评估三个维度：完整性、简洁性和确定性，并在多数据集与多模型上揭示现有LLMs在全局推理质量上的明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评价方法偏重局部事实及其归因，忽略长文答案的全局逻辑一致性，导致模型在看似有据的回答中存在推理缺口。

Method: 提出LogicScore框架，基于Horn规则，将反向验证融入评估流程，系统性评估完整性、简洁性和确定性三大推理维度。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MusiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA等三大数据集及20余个LLMs上进行广泛实验，发现模型在归因层面高分，但在全局推理质量上存在显著差距；例如Gemini-3 Pro达到92.85%精确度的归因分数，却仅实现35.11%的简洁性。此结果提示需要把推理连贯性作为与事实基础同等重要的评价目标。

Conclusion: LogicScore为评估LLMs全局推理能力提供了新标准，促使研发者在提升事实能力的同时加强对推理连贯性的关注。代码公开以促成复现与后续改进。

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

*Vuong Hung Truong,Mariana Gabrielle Cangco Reyes,Masatoshi Koizumi,Jihwan Myung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究揭示 Reddit 大规模数据中语义熵的昼夜节律性，局部语义探索在上午峰值，而全局语义多样性在一天后段峰值，呈现“丰富即富集”的动态，与情感无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示 circadian 生物节律对高维语义行为的影响，填补对语言语义维度在时间维度上的认知机制空白，评估光照提示对节律的潜在驱动。

Method: 利用预训练 Transformer 将文本嵌入向量，计算语义熵作为探索-利用的指标；区分局部与全局语义熵分析日内模式，控制情感变量，使用 Reddit 数据推断节律与光照对齐。

Result: 发现显著的昼夜节律性：局部语义探索在早晨峰值；全局语义多样性在一天后段峰值，呈现“富者越富”的动力学；这些模式并未被情感极性解释，与 mood 区分开来；与已知的昼夜神经调质系统模式一致，暗示生物时钟对语义领域也有影响。

Conclusion: 生物昼夜节律扩展到语义域，表明语义探索是一个独立于情感的认知维度，日内模式可能受季节性光照驱动的节律性机制调控。

Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.

TL;DR: 建立一个包含200例胸部X光影像、12标签的基准数据集和辅助标注流程，用于评估多模态大模型在放射学任务中的性能，并提供一个可公开的 holdout 集以独立评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量、领域专家驱动的基准数据集对于实现临床实用的多模态大模型至关重要，需降低标注成本并提高一致性。

Method: 从MIDRC获取13,735张去识别的胸部X光及其报告；用GPT-4o从报告中提取异常发现并映射至12个基准标签，使用本地Phi-4-Reasoning模型完成映射；随机选取1000个样本根据AI建议标签供专家评审；17名胸科放射科医生参与标注，三名专家对每张影像给出Agree All/Agree Mostly/Disagree；最终在381张影像中达到Three Radiologists同意，选出200张组成基准集，其中100张对外发布、100张作为holdout待RSNA独立评估；公开提供该基准集及12标签。

Result: 生成了包含200张胸片、12标签的基准数据集；holdout数据集供独立评估；公开发布链接；提出了AI辅助标注流程以提升标注规模和减少遗漏。

Conclusion: 该工作提供高质量、可复现的基准与标注流程，支持对比不同模型，推动放射影像多模态LLM评估标准化与规模化标注。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于证据的跨时比较评审质量框架，并在 ICLR、NeurIPS、ACL 上应用，结果显示中位评审质量并未呈现持续下降趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回应关于评审质量下降的普遍叙事，评审质量难以衡量，跨场景、跨时间的比较困难。

Method: 构建多维评审质量框架，标准化评审格式，使用面向编辑与作者的效用度量，结合大语言模型(LLM)与轻量化度量，进行跨时比较分析。

Result: 在跨时分析中，未发现跨 venues 与年度存在一致的中位评审质量下降趋势；不同会议之间的评审格式多样性得到体现。

Conclusion: 提出替代解释与未来研究路线，呼吁更严格的实证研究设计和可重复性的数据收集，以更好地理解评审质量的演变。

Abstract: Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.

### [32] [Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15220)
*Anmol Goel,Cornelius Emde,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh,Martin Gubri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benign fine-tuning of frontier language models can cause privacy collapse: models maintain high performance yet reveal or leak contextual privacy, with privacy representations unusually fragile to fine-tuning. This vulnerability is supported by broad empirical evidence and implies safety gaps for specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exposes a critical risk to user privacy and system safety when fine-tuning powerful models. Current safety benchmarks may not detect privacy vulnerabilities, especially under agentic or memory-based tasks, necessitating a deeper investigation into how training-time and fine-tuning data shape privacy behavior.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study across six models (closed and open weights), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Includes mechanistic analysis comparing privacy-relevant representations to task-relevant features and examining specific leakage phenomena (e.g., tool usage, internal variable exposure, memory boundary violations).

Result: Found evidence of privacy collapse across settings: models degrade contextual privacy, share information with tools inappropriately, and violate memory boundaries, despite maintaining strong performance on standard safety/utility benchmarks. Privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning relative to task-relevant features.

Conclusion: There is a critical gap in current safety evaluations for deploying specialized agents; safety assessments must explicitly test contextual privacy under fine-tuning and agentic use cases, and future work should explore mitigation strategies to preserve privacy during fine-tuning.

Abstract: We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 元数据条件化用于区域化大型语言模型（LLMs）的本地化，使用URL、国家/洲标签等元数据对0.5B和1B参数的新闻数据进行预训练，经过四组对照实验，元数据条件化在不损害跨区域泛化的前提下提升区域内性能，并使全球模型能够实现与区域特定模型相当的本地化效果，且提高学习效率。通过URL级元数据捕捉地理信号，且区域覆盖的平衡性仍关键；在800题本地化新闻多选题基准及指令微调后，元数据条件化的全局模型性能可与LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct相当。总体表明元数据条件化是一个实用且计算高效的本地化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在全球范围内表现趋于同质化的问题，提出一种轻量级、可扩展的本地化手段，通过元数据（如URL、地区标签）对模型进行条件化，以实现区域化能力的提升而不需要完全区域专属模型。

Method: 基于4个对照实验，对31个模型（0.5B与1B参数）在大规模新闻数据上进行从头训练，数据带有经过验证的URL、国家标签、洲标签等元数据。进行URL级、地区级等元数据的消融实验，并在新闻MCQ本地化基准和指令微调场景下评估性能。比较对象包括区域特定模型与全球模型，评估跨区域泛化、学习效率，以及对缺失区域的鲁棒性。

Result: 元数据条件化在区域内性能提升稳健且不牺牲跨区域泛化；全球模型能通过元数据达到与区域模型相当的本地化水平，且在学习效率上得到提升；URL级元数据包含大量地理信号，区域覆盖的平衡性仍然关键，元数据无法弥补所有缺失的区域；在800题本地化新闻MCQ与指令微调后，元数据条件化的全局模型性能达到与LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct相当的水平，且数据量显著较少。

Conclusion: 元数据条件化为语言模型本地化提供了一个实用、计算高效的路径，既保留跨区域泛化，又提升区域化表现，具备良好的数据效率与可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained by treating text as a single global distribution, often resulting in geographically homogenized behavior. We study metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach for localization, pre-training 31 models (at 0.5B and 1B parameter scales) from scratch on large-scale English news data annotated with verified URLs, country tags, and continent tags, covering 4 continents and 17 countries. Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.

TL;DR: LLMs suffer lower numeric accuracy when inputs use underrepresented numeral scripts/formats; few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping can significantly reduce this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked challenge of multilingual numerical reasoning: robustness of LLMs to diverse numeral scripts and formatting, ensuring reliable interpretation and manipulation of numbers.

Method: Evaluate LLM performance on numerical tasks across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats; test prompting strategies such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping to measure impact on accuracy.

Result: LLM accuracy declines for inputs rendered in underrepresented numeral scripts or formats; targeted prompting strategies substantially narrow the gap and improve cross-script numerical reasoning.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical, previously underexplored challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning. Provides actionable prompting-based approaches (few-shot, explicit numeral mapping) and motivates future work to enhance LLMs' numerical robustness across diverse numeral systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive proficiency in basic arithmetic, rivaling human-level performance on standard numerical tasks. However, little attention has been given to how these models perform when numerical expressions deviate from the prevailing conventions present in their training corpora. In this work, we investigate numerical reasoning across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats. We show that LLM accuracy drops substantially when numerical inputs are rendered in underrepresented scripts or formats, despite the underlying mathematical reasoning being identical. We further demonstrate that targeted prompting strategies, such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping, can greatly narrow this gap. Our findings highlight an overlooked challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and provide actionable insights for working with LLMs to reliably interpret, manipulate, and generate numbers across diverse numeral scripts and formatting styles.

TL;DR: 提出 AdSent：一个情感鲁棒的假新闻检测框架，通过 LLM 生成的情感对抗攻击、情感偏移分析，以及情感无关训练，提升鲁棒性与泛化能力，在三数据集上优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感信号在假新闻检测中常被利用，但容易被对抗性情感操控攻击所利用，LLM 驱动的情感扰动尚未被充分研究，需要提升检测对情感扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 使用大语言模型进行受控的情感为基础的对抗攻击；2) 分析情感变化对检测性能的影响；3) 提出情感无关的训练策略以提高对这类扰动的鲁棒性；在三类基准数据集上进行广泛实验，比较与基线方法。

Result: 情感转变显著影响检测性能：中性文章更易被判定为真实，非中性文章更易被判定为假；AdSent 在准确率和鲁棒性方面显著优于竞争基线，且对未见数据集与对抗场景具有良好泛化。

Conclusion: 情感操控构成假新闻检测的关键脆弱点，情感无关训练可有效提升鲁棒性与泛化性；未来可进一步扩展到跨模态或更强的对抗防御。

Abstract: Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.

Motivation: 公共辩护机构面临繁重案源和资源不足，现有 AI 法律检索研究未对辩护工作场景产生明确帮助。此研究旨在在实际公共辩护环境中开发可用的检索工具并改进相关基准。

Method: 与新泽西公共辩护办公室合作，开发 NJ BriefBank；通过在检索任务中引入领域知识（如法理推理的查询扩展、领域数据和合成示例）来提升检索质量；对现实辩护场景的查询进行分类，公开手工标注的公共辩护检索数据集。

Result: 发现现有法律检索基准难以迁移到公共辩护场景；通过领域知识引入，检索质量得到提升；提供查询分类、数据集及公开资源，为未来研究提供基线和起点。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建实用、可靠的公共辩护检索 AI 工具以及更真实的法律检索基准提供起点，强调将领域知识融入检索、并鼓励后续在真实场景中的进一步验证与扩展。

Abstract: AI tools are increasingly suggested as solutions to assist public agencies with heavy workloads. In public defense, where a constitutional right to counsel meets the complexities of law, overwhelming caseloads and constrained resources, practitioners face especially taxing conditions. Yet, there is little evidence of how AI could meaningfully support defenders' day-to-day work. In partnership with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, we develop the NJ BriefBank, a retrieval tool which surfaces relevant appellate briefs to streamline legal research and writing. We show that existing legal retrieval benchmarks fail to transfer to public defense search, however adding domain knowledge improves retrieval quality. This includes query expansion with legal reasoning, domain-specific data and curated synthetic examples. To facilitate further research, we provide a taxonomy of realistic defender search queries and release a manually annotated public defense retrieval dataset. Together, our work offers starting points towards building practical, reliable retrieval AI tools for public defense, and towards more realistic legal retrieval benchmarks.

TL;DR: 解释类型显著引导用户在检索增强生成系统的回答中判断可信度，但信任不仅取决于客观质量，还受回答清晰度、可操作性与用户先验知识影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在理解在信息获取系统中，生成式AI的回答若被不同形式的解释所包裹，用户的信任感会如何变化，以及不同解释类型对可信度判断的影响。

Method: 采用受控两阶段用户研究：让参与者在一对回答中选择更可信的一方（其中一方在客观质量上更高），对照有无三种解释类型之一的效应：源头归属、事实依据、信息覆盖。实现了在有/无解释条件下的比较与三种解释类型的独立效应分析。

Result: 结果显示，解释显著引导用户倾向于选择更高质量的回答；但信任并非仅由客观质量决定，受回答的清晰度、可操作性以及参与者的先验知识等因素显著影响。

Conclusion: 解释有助于引导用户识别高质量回答，但信任的形成是多因素的，应在系统设计中同时提升回答的清晰性、可操作性，并考虑用户的知识背景。

Abstract: The integration of generative AI into information access systems often presents users with synthesized answers that lack transparency. This study investigates how different types of explanations can influence user trust in responses from retrieval-augmented generation systems. We conducted a controlled, two-stage user study where participants chose the more trustworthy response from a pair-one objectively higher quality than the other-both with and without one of three explanation types: (1) source attribution, (2) factual grounding, and (3) information coverage. Our results show that while explanations significantly guide users toward selecting higher quality responses, trust is not dictated by objective quality alone: Users' judgments are also heavily influenced by response clarity, actionability, and their own prior knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出在RAG中预测两类性能：RPP（检索输出的效用）和GPP（最终回答质量），并通过多类特征（检索性能预测、阅读者信号、查询无关信号）构建线性回归模型，实验在NQ数据集显示融合多类特征最能预测RAG性能。


<details>

Motivation: 改进RAG系统需要在检索文档对回答的贡献与最终答案的质量之间建立可预测信号。通过借鉴QPP等方法并引入读者视角和文档质量特征，提升预测准确性。

Method: 使用线性回归模型，输入特征来自：1) 相关性/检索信号（QPP等） 2) 阅读者信号（如在输入查询条件下的上下文困惑度/LLM perplexity） 3) 查询无关的文档质量与可读性特征，训练两个任务RPP与GPP。

Result: 在Natural Questions数据集上，单独或组合特征均可预测RAG性能，且把多类别特征结合起来能获得最准确的RPP和GPP预测。

Conclusion: 将QPP思路扩展到RPP/GPP是可行的，额外的读者中心特征和无关性/可读性信号可提升预测准确性，支持更好的RAG系统自适应选择文档与回答生成。

Abstract: The quality of answers generated by large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is largely influenced by the contextual information contained in the retrieved documents. A key challenge for improving RAG is to predict both the utility of retrieved documents -- quantified as the performance gain from using context over generation without context -- and the quality of the final answers in terms of correctness and relevance. In this paper, we define two prediction tasks within RAG. The first is retrieval performance prediction (RPP), which estimates the utility of retrieved documents. The second is generation performance prediction (GPP), which estimates the final answer quality. We hypothesise that in RAG, the topical relevance of retrieved documents correlates with their utility, suggesting that query performance prediction (QPP) approaches can be adapted for RPP and GPP. Beyond these retriever-centric signals, we argue that reader-centric features, such as the LLM's perplexity of the retrieved context conditioned on the input query, can further enhance prediction accuracy for both RPP and GPP. Finally, we propose that features reflecting query-agnostic document quality and readability can also provide useful signals to the predictions. We train linear regression models with the above categories of predictors for both RPP and GPP. Experiments on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset show that combining predictors from multiple feature categories yields the most accurate estimates of RAG performance.

### [39] [When Text-as-Vision Meets Semantic IDs in Generative Recommendation: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14697)
*Shutong Qiao,Wei Yuan,Tong Chen,Xiangyu Zhao,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: OCR-based text representations, rendered as images and encoded with vision-based OCR models, consistently match or exceed standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in unimodal and multimodal Generative Recommendation, and remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard text encoders are optimized for well-formed natural language, but item descriptions in real-world data are symbolic/attribute-centric with numerals, units, and abbreviations. In multimodal GR, text and image embeddings often have mismatched geometry, hindering cross-modal fusion. Treat text as a visual signal to align representations with visual cues.

Method: Render item descriptions as images and extract text embeddings using vision-based OCR models. Evaluate OCR-text against conventional text embeddings across four datasets and two generative backbones, in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Test robustness to extreme spatial-resolution compression.

Result: OCR-text representations either match or outperform standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning across unimodal and multimodal setups. They also exhibit strong robustness to aggressive spatial-resolution compression, suggesting efficiency and practicality for deployment.

Conclusion: Viewing text as a visual signal via OCR-based Semantic IDs improves semantic coherence and cross-modal fusion, offering robust and efficient representations for Semantic ID learning in GR models.

Abstract: Semantic ID learning is a key interface in Generative Recommendation (GR) models, mapping items to discrete identifiers grounded in side information, most commonly via a pretrained text encoder. However, these text encoders are primarily optimized for well-formed natural language. In real-world recommendation data, item descriptions are often symbolic and attribute-centric, containing numerals, units, and abbreviations. These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.
  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models. Experiments across four datasets and two generative backbones show that OCR-text consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Furthermore, we find that OCR-based Semantic IDs remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression, indicating strong robustness and efficiency in practical deployments.

TL;DR: 提出一种多任务学习框架，统一图像检索、文本检索与NLU任务的特征表示，通过共享文本编码器提升多语言检索的效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型将图像与文本编码在共享嵌入空间，但在文本检索方面落后于专用文本模型；增加文本编码器会带来存储与推理开销，且多语言场景检索效率下降。需要一个统一的特征表示来提升多模态与多任务的检索与理解能力。

Method: 在一个框架内联合优化图像检索、文本检索与NLU任务，使用一个共享的文本编码器，并通过引入NLU特征来提升意图理解与检索准确性，从而兼容处理图片、长文本、短文本与意图丰富的查询。

Result: 理论上实现跨模态与跨任务的统一表征，减少冗余的文本编码，提升多语言场景下的检索能力与效率；但原摘要未给出具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 本工作首次将多任务学习应用于同时优化多语言图像检索、文本检索与NLU任务，展示共享文本编码器在统一表示学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems typically employ Vision Language Models (VLMs) that encode images and text independently into vectors within a shared embedding space. Despite incorporating text encoders, VLMs consistently underperform specialized text models on text-only retrieval tasks. Moreover, introducing additional text encoders increases storage, inference overhead, and exacerbates retrieval inefficiencies, especially in multilingual settings. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-task learning framework that unifies the feature representation across images, long and short texts, and intent-rich queries. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize multilingual image retrieval, text retrieval, and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks within a single framework. Our approach integrates image and text retrieval with a shared text encoder that is enhanced by NLU features for intent understanding and retrieval accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GCF和基于图的社交推荐在参数规模和可扩展性方面的挑战；现有方法需要大量参数来分配显式的用户/物品嵌入，导致计算成本高。

Method: 通过以社会有意义的信号来构建用户表示，不为每个用户学习显式嵌入；并在时间和内存效率上优化建模过程，同时保留或提升推荐性能；相对于最轻量的GCF基线，参数量减少至多50%。

Result: 在13个GCF和基于图的社交推荐基线上实现SOTA，覆盖从冷启动到高度活跃用户的不同互动稀疏度，表现出色，且具备良好的时间和内存效率。

Conclusion: 参数高效的用户表示学习与社交知识整合可以在保持或提升推荐性能的同时显著降低模型参数规模，提升可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Graph-based social recommendation (SocialRec) has emerged as a powerful extension of graph collaborative filtering (GCF), which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture multi-hop collaborative signals from user-item interactions. These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.

*Parviz Ahmadov,Masoud Mansoury*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Post-hoc fairness method PopSteer uses a Sparse Autoencoder to interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommender systems by identifying popularity-sensitive neurons via synthetic users and adjusting their activations; improves fairness with minimal accuracy loss and provides interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Popularity bias causes overexposure of popular items, underexposure of many items, harming fairness and possibly recommendation quality; existing mitigation methods lack transparency; a transparent, interpretable, post-hoc solution is desirable.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder to mimic a trained recommender model while enabling neuron-level interpretability; generate synthetic users with strong preferences for popular or unpopular items to identify neurons encoding popularity signals through activation patterns; steer recommendations by modulating the activations of the most biased neurons; evaluate on a sequential recommender across three public datasets.

Result: PopSteer yields significant fairness improvements with minimal impact on accuracy; provides interpretable, neuron-level insights and enables fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: PopSteer offers a transparent, interpretable post-hoc mechanism to mitigate popularity bias in sequential recommendation, balancing fairness and accuracy while giving interpretable control over the trade-off.

Abstract: Popularity bias is a pervasive challenge in recommender systems, where a few popular items dominate attention while the majority of less popular items remain underexposed. This imbalance can reduce recommendation quality and lead to unfair item exposure. Although existing mitigation methods address this issue to some extent, they often lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with strong preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns. We then steer recommendations by adjusting the activations of the most biased neurons. Experiments on three public datasets with a sequential recommendation model demonstrate that PopSteer significantly enhances fairness with minimal impact on accuracy, while providing interpretable insights and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

TL;DR: NUMEN提出通过无学习的确定性字符哈希，将语言直接投射到高维向量，从而打破固定长度嵌入的维度瓶颈，在LIMIT数据集上超过BM25，表明密集检索的瓶颈在嵌入层而非架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决即使是7B参数的嵌入模型在简单检索任务上仍落后于BM25的问题。理论指出维度瓶颈来自将丰富语言信息压缩到固定长度向量。提出一种无学习、可扩展容量的替代方案以提升检索性能。

Method: 采用确定性字符哈希将文本投射到高维向量空间，无需训练；支持无限词汇量；嵌入维度可按需扩展，容量随需增长。

Result: 在LIMIT基准上达到 Recall@100=0.9390，维度为32,768；成为首个超过BM25基线（Recall@100=0.936）的密集检索模型。

Conclusion: 核心问题在于嵌入层容量而非模型架构或训练策略。解决之道是扩大嵌入空间，而非提升训练能力。

Abstract: Why do even the most powerful 7B-parameter embedding models struggle with simple retrieval tasks that the decades old BM25 handles with ease? Recent theory suggests that this happens because of a dimensionality bottleneck. This occurs when we force infinite linguistic nuances into small, fixed-length learned vectors. We developed NUMEN to break this bottleneck by removing the learning process entirely. Instead of training heavy layers to map text to a constrained space, NUMEN uses deterministic character hashing to project language directly onto high-dimensional vectors. This approach requires no training, supports an unlimited vocabulary, and allows the geometric capacity scale as needed. On the LIMIT benchmark, NUMEN achieves 93.90 % Recall@100 at 32,768 dimensions. This makes it the first dense retrieval model to officially surpass the sparse BM25 baseline 93.6 %. Our findings show that the real problem in dense retrieval isn't the architecture, but the embedding layer itself. The solution isn't necessarily smarter training, but simply providing more room to breathe.

Abstract: Agentic search has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm, where an agent interleaves multi-step reasoning with on-demand retrieval to solve complex questions. Despite its success, how to design a retriever for agentic search remains largely underexplored. Existing search agents typically rely on similarity-based retrievers, while similar passages are not always useful for final answer generation. In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent. Extensive experiments on seven single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that our retriever, termed \ours{}, consistently outperforms strong baselines across different search agents.

*Denise M. Case*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文给出关于本体中立性的不可行性结果：若本体在根本层面包含因果或规范性结论，它就无法在冲突解释框架之间作为中性共享底层；中性底层须为预因果、预规范的，并将解释、评价与外化，同时明确实体的身份与持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续的法律、政治与分析分歧环境下，需要一个能够跨框架稳定共享的底层本体，以实现可追溯性与问责。

Method: 理论论证与形式分析：将中立性定义为对不兼容扩展的interpretative non-commitment与稳定性，证明包含因果/规范性承诺的本体与中立性冲突；推导出预因果/预规范的必要性。

Result: 不可行性定理：任何声称因果或 deontic 结论为本体事实的子本体都无法作为跨框架的中性底层；只有预因果/预规范的底层才能在外化解释等同时保持一致性。

Conclusion: 论文不提出具体本体或协议，而是给出在多框架冲突下维持稳定共享表示所需的设计约束。

Abstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

Conclusion: 主张采用 Liberal 路线，赋予AI认知治理一个与AI伦理同等的可争议、显式治理结构，以规范信念形成与表达。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

TL;DR: 提出 VisTIRA 框架和 LaTeX→图像的推理管线，以及基于 SnapAsk 的工具使用轨迹，用于提升视觉数学推理；结果表明工具集成推理有效提升图像题推理，OCR 定位对小模型有额外改善但规模增大后效益递减；模态差距与模型规模呈负相关，结构化推理与 OCR 定位互为补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同一数学题以文本与图像两种模态呈现时，视觉模型在数学推理上的表现显著落后，原因在于读取密集公式、排版以及混合符号-图示上下文的困难导致模态差距（modality gap）。

Method: 提出 VisTIRA（Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent）作为工具集成的分解式推理框架，通过将图像中的题目分解为自然语言的推理链和可执行的 Python 步骤来推导答案；并构建 LaTeX 基pipe，将链式推理文本生成具有挑战性的图像形式；基于真实作业风格数据集生成的工具使用轨迹（SnapAsk）用于对 VLM 进行微调。

Result: 实验表明工具集成的监督提升了图像基推理能力；OCR 基于定位（grounding）对较小模型能进一步缩小差距，但随着模型规模增大收益减弱。

Conclusion: 模态差距的严重程度与模型规模呈反向关系；结构化推理与 OCR 基础定位是推进视觉数学推理的互补策略。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究微调后的LLM在PDDL规划任务中的泛化能力，是可迁移的规划能力还是域记忆的体现。

Method: 对1.7B参数的LLM进行40,000个域-问题-计划三元组的微调，覆盖10个IPC 2023域；在域内和跨域场景下评估；引入三种诊断干预：实例级符号匿名化、紧凑计划序列化、以VAL验证器为信号的奖赏微调（verifier-reward fine-tuning）

Result: 域内有效计划率为82.9%，跨域对未见域为0%。符号匿名化与紧凑序列化降低了性能，表明对表层表示敏感；verifier-reward微调在监督训练的前半阶段即可达到饱和，但不能提升跨域泛化。总体在域内≈80%附近，跨域崩溃，表明微调模型依赖域特定模式而非可迁移的规划能力。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM基于微调的规划能力存在显著的跨域泛化缺口，强调需要诊断工具来发现原因，并推动关注可迁移的规划能力而非仅靠域内记忆。

Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

Conclusion: 将膝点引导的组选择和多树GP框架结合，可显著提升大规模动态多模式RCPSP的调度性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

TL;DR: 提出并评估基于本地大语言模型的自适应匿名化框架SFAA，用于定性访谈文本的检测、分类与去识别，包含规则替换、上下文重写、泛化与抑制等策略。通过两项案例研究（82个面对面访谈、93次机器主导访谈）及两种本地模型（LLaMA、Phi）评估，结果显示Phi在发现敏感数据方面优于LLaMA并能在保持文本情感不变的前提下达到约91%的敏感数据覆盖率和约94.8%的情感保持率，表明该方法对定性数据分析影响低且具有可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定性研究文本包含隐私风险，手动去标识耗时且不一致，传统自动化工具局限于模式匹配，缺乏上下文，可能改变含义；需要可重复、上下文感知的隐私保护方法。

Method: 提出SFAA框架，三步：检测、分类、自适应匿名化；四种策略：规则替换、上下文重写、泛化、抑制；依据标识类型与风险等级选择策略；遵循GDPR、HIPAA、OECD等规范；采用双重方法评估（人工与LLM辅助）；两案例研究；使用本地模型LLaMA与Phi进行评估。

Result: LLMs检测到的敏感数据数量多于人类评审；Phi优于LLaMA，但错检略多；Phi覆盖约91%的敏感数据，且保留原文情感的94.8%，对定性分析影响极小。

Conclusion: 在本地LLM条件下，SFAA能实现可靠、可重复、情境感知的定性文本匿名化；Phi表现最佳，表明基于LLM的自适应匿名化在保护隐私与保持数据分析完整性之间具有良好折中；可为合规与伦理标准下的定性研究数据处理提供有效方案。

Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

### [52] [Gaming the Judge: Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought Can Undermine Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691)
*Muhammad Khalifa,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Jaekyeom Kim,Sungryull Sohn,Yunxiang Zhang,Moontae Lee,Hao Peng,Lu Wang,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based evaluation is vulnerable: manipulating agent reasoning traces can artificially inflate false-positive rates in judges; content-based manipulation is particularly effective; prompting strategies and larger judge-time compute help but do not fully mitigate; robust judging requires evidence-based verification against observable data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The common assumption is that an agent's chain-of-thought (CoT) faithfully reflects internal reasoning and the environment state. The paper challenges this by showing LLM judges can be gamed through manipulated reasoning traces, risking unreliable evaluation.

Method: Systematically rewrite agent CoTs while keeping actions and observations fixed, across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. Compare style-based manipulations ( presentation changes ) with content-based manipulations (fabricating task-progress signals). Evaluate prompting-based defenses and scaling judge-time compute to mitigate susceptibility.

Result: Manipulated reasoning alone can raise false-positive rates of leading LLM-based judges by up to 90%. Content-based manipulations outperform style-based ones. Prompting strategies and increased judge-time compute reduce, but do not fully eliminate, susceptibility to manipulation.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation is fundamentally vulnerable to reasoning-manipulation. There is a need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence rather than relying solely on internal CoT traces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

Conclusion: AutoDriDM 填补感知中心和决策中心评测之间的空白，为更安全、可靠的现实自驾 VLMs 提供指引，推动感知-决策耦合的模型设计与评估研究。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

*Mingxuan Song,Yusen Huo,Bohan Zhou,Shenglin Yin,Zhen Xiao,Jieyi Long,Zhilin Zhang,Chuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 GRPO-Adaptive 与 DARA 框架，将大语言模型（LLM）的就地学习能力与精细化优化结合，用于 AI 生成竞价（AIGB）中的预算约束下的广告主累计价值最大化，在少样本场景下展示优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在广告投放优化中，广告主通常数据稀缺，传统强化学习难以在 few-shot 场景中有效学习。LLMs 拥有强大的就地学习与推理能力，但缺乏对齐到数值优化的精确性。需一种方法既能利用 LLM 的推理能力，又能实现高精度的数值优化。

Method: GRPO-Adaptive：一种高效的LLM后训练策略，通过训练过程中动态更新参考策略来提升推理能力与数值精度。DARA：双阶段框架，将决策分为两步：第一步为 few-shot 推理者，利用上下文提示生成初步计划；第二步为细粒度优化器，用反馈驱动的推理对计划进行细化与改进。两者结合实现对 AIGB 的高效、精确优化。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据环境中进行的广泛实验显示，所提出的方法在预算约束下的累计广告主价值方面持续优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM 的就地学习与可控数值优化分离并协同，DARA 框架有效提升了 AIGB 任务的性能，具备较好的普适性与应用潜力，但需要注意推理-优化之间的耦合与计算成本。

Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative reasoning and problem solving approach in symbolic AI. Its rule-based formalism makes it inherently attractive for explainable and interpretive reasoning, which is gaining importance with the surge of Explainable AI (XAI). A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.

Motivation: 现有无监督摘要多依赖单模态特征，忽略语义信息在关键帧选择中的导向作用，且GAN训练过程不稳定，难以获得一致的摘要质量。

Method: 引入帧级语义对齐注意力机制并嵌入到关键帧选择器中，指导基于Transformer的生成器在对抗训练中更好重建视频；采用增量训练策略，逐步更新模型组件以缓解GAN训练不稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的语义引导无监督视频摘要框架通过语义对齐和增量训练提升关键帧选择与视频重建效果，具有较强的实证支持与潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

### [57] [Towards Bound Consistency for the No-Overlap Constraint Using MDDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14784)
*Amaury Guichard,Laurent Michel,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于有界一致性的 no-overlap 约束筛选的新算法：通过基于 Ciré & van Hoeve 的 no-overlap MDD 提取时间窗边界、对 MDD 宽度设阈值以得到松弛 MDD，从而实现多项式时间的边界筛选；实验显示在带时窗和即时到达(JIT)目标的排程问题上显著降低搜索路径和求解时间，并与以往 Ciré & van Hoeve 的先行-后续规则互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 no-overlap 的边界一致性求解是 NP-hard，但在实际排程中，仍需有效的过滤来显著缩小搜索树，以提高求解效率。

Method: 在 Ciré 与 van Hoeve 给出的 no-overlap MDD 的基础上，提取作业的时间窗边界以实现起始/结束时间的有界收敛；同时通过将 MDD 的宽度限制为阈值来构建一个松弛的 MDD，从而对边界一致性过滤进行近似。实验中将该过滤应用于带时间窗和即时到达目标的排序问题（1 | r_j, d_j, ar{d}_j | ∑ E_j + ∑ T_j），并与 Ciré & van Hoeve 的先后检测算法进行对比。

Result: 所提出的带宽度阈值的筛选在树中访问的节点数量和求解时间上，优于现有的先行-先后算法，且与经典传播方法互补，显著降低了多实例的求解成本。

Conclusion: 基于 MDD 的边界筛选方法在 no-overlap 约束下实现了有界一致性，且通过松弛的 MDD 仍保持有效性，提供了对传统传播的有效补充并在实际排序问题中表现出更好的剪枝效率。

Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed CI4A: an agent-centric, semantic UI component interface built atop Ant Design, converting UI interaction into a unified tool primitive set; enables a dynamic action space for agents; improved WebArena benchmark yields SoTA 86.3% success and higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between LLMs' high-level planning and low-level, fine-grained web component manipulation by designing interfaces optimized for agents rather than humans, enabling more robust grounding and control.

Method: Introduce Component Interface for Agent (CI4A) as a semantic encapsulation of UI component interaction into unified tool primitives. Implemented in Ant Design covering 23 UI component categories. Developed a hybrid agent with a dynamic action space that adapts to page state and invokes CI4A tools. Refactored WebArena benchmark using CI4A-integrated Ant Design to evaluate SoTA methods.

Result: CI4A-enabled agent substantially outperforms existing approaches on WebArena, achieving a new state-of-the-art task success rate of 86.3% and notable improvements in execution efficiency.

Conclusion: Agent-optimized, semantic UI abstractions (CI4A) can significantly enhance task performance and efficiency in web interaction tasks, suggesting broader applicability to other UI frameworks and potential for improved grounding of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs achieve high flat accuracy in chest X-ray classification but exhibit severe abstraction errors under clinical taxonomies; taxonomy-aware tuning and risk-aware thresholds can reduce catastrophic abstraction errors to <2% with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between flat accuracy and clinically meaningful hierarchies by quantifying abstraction errors and aligning VLM representations with medical taxonomies to ensure safer deployment.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics; define Catastrophic Abstraction Errors (cross-branch mistakes); propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings to align representations with taxonomy.

Result: Identified substantial misalignment with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance; proposed methods reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2% while maintaining competitive overall performance.

Conclusion: Hierarchical evaluation and taxonom y-aware, representation-level alignment are essential for safer, clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs in medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

Motivation: 解决知识表示与推理系统（KR&R）与主流面向对象编程之间的集成鸿沟；现有 KR&R 框架依赖外部本体与专用语言，难以与指令式代码无缝集成；通过将知识作为一等公民的编程抽象，实现逻辑推理与面向对象实现的一体化。

Method: 提出 KRROOD 框架，利用原生类结构表示知识，模糊地跨越逻辑编程与面向对象编程的边界，使知识成为编程语言的一部分。通过在同一语言层面对推理与执行进行支持，结合 OWL2Bench 与人机任务学习场景进行评估。

Conclusion: KRROOD 成功搭建了 KR&R 与软件工程之间的桥梁，将知识提升为编程中的第一公民，适用于需要丰富推理能力的自主动系统。

Abstract: This paper introduces KRROOD, a framework designed to bridge the integration gap between modern software engineering and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR&R) systems. While Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard for developing complex applications, existing KR&R frameworks often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages that are difficult to integrate with imperative code. KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms. We evaluate the system on the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario. Experimental results show that KRROOD achieves strong performance while supporting the expressive reasoning required for real-world autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.

*Fabio Morreale,Joan Serrà,Yuki Mistufuji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes Explainable AI (XAI) from a traditional, model-centric view to a Barad-inspired, emergent practice where explanations arise from material-discursive entanglements among AI systems, humans, contexts, and interpretive tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question the ontological and epistemological assumptions in current XAI that treat meaning as immanent to models and explanations as deployable outside observers; argue for an agential realism-based framework to ethically orient XAI design.

Method: Theoretical analysis drawing on Barad's agential realism; reading a broad set of XAI methods through this lens; identifying hidden assumptions and limitations; developing design principles; illustrating with a speculative text-to-music interface case study.

Result: Reveals how many XAI methods embed implicit separations between explainer and system; articulates an ethical dimension; proposes a framework for emergent interpretation and actionable design directions for XAI interfaces that foster co-constituted meanings, demonstrated via a speculative implementation case.

Conclusion: XAI should be conceptualized as emergent, material-discursive practice shaped by situated entanglements; design should enable ongoing, context-sensitive interpretation rather than fixed, detached explanations.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

Method: 通过针对OCR和事实核验的微基准测试与案例研究，量化AI工具在简单任务上的效率损失，并提出用于工具选择的框架。

Result: 量化了约6.5x的延迟惩罚与潜在的算法谄媚风险；提出工具选择工程和确定性-概率性决策矩阵作为解决方案。

Conclusion: 主张教育与培训应扩展至“何时不用AI”的判定，以提升数字素养与资源利用效率。

Abstract: The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在专门领域的多跳组合推理能力有限，需以结构化领域知识作为可验证的监督信号来支撑推理过程的可组合性和可解释性。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱的隐式奖励的后训练流水线：在短跳推理路径（1-3跳）上进行监督微调和RL训练，通过从知识图谱路径派生奖励信号，促使模型在RL中也优化中间公理的组合而非仅最终答案；14B模型；零样本评估在4-5跳的复杂推理任务上。

Result: 在最困难的推理任务上，模型显著优于更大模型及前沿系统（如GPT-5.2、Gemini 3 Pro），并对获得性扰动（选项打乱等）具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将推理过程“grounded”于结构化知识是可扩展且高效的智能推理路径，路径派生的奖励提供可验证的、可组合的推理信号，具备跨域迁移潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

Method: 提出 Latent Action Queries，构建双分支架构以估计视觉先验 p(a|v) 与语言条件后验 π(a|v,ℓ)，并通过最大化动作与指令之间的条件点互信息 PMI(I(a;ℓ|v)) 来训练策略；在现有数据上实现，无需额外数据。

Result: 在 SimplerEnv 与 RoboCasa 上进行了广泛实验，尤其在 OOD 的 SimplerEnv 基准上实现 11.3% 的性能提升，证实了对语言在动作层面的鲁棒 grounding 能力的提升。

Conclusion: 通过贝叶斯分解与 PMI 目标抑制视觉捷径，强化对指令的遵循与 grounding，提升 VLA 的泛化性与鲁棒性，且无需额外数据，适用于复杂多任务的机器人操作场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.

Conclusion: 证明将非结构化呼叫中心对话转换为有价值的问答微调数据资源的可行性，提升客户服务领域的 Q&A 系统潜力；并推动可重复研究的发展。

Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: Exploratory study of Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) style attacks on diffusion LLMs (LLaDA). Evaluates prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation on AdvBench harmful prompts. Provides preliminary insights into robustness and attack surface, and suggests new optimization/evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in diffusion LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs are a growing alternative to autoregressive models, but their security and robustness to adversarial prompts are underexplored. Understanding the attack surface is crucial to develop defenses and reliable evaluation.

Method: Implement GCG-style adversarial prompts for diffusion LLMs (LLaDA). Test variants including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation on harmful prompts from AdvBench in an exploratory setting.

Result: The study yields initial insights indicating a nontrivial attack surface for diffusion LLMs and varying effectiveness across attack variants; findings are preliminary and framed as a first step without definitive quantitative claims.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in diffusion LLMs and motivates future work on robustness and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: While most LLMs are autoregressive, diffusion-based LLMs have recently emerged as an alternative method for generation. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks have proven effective against autoregressive models, but their applicability to diffusion language models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an exploratory study of GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion with mAsking), an open-source diffusion LLM. We evaluate multiple attack variants, including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, on harmful prompts drawn from the AdvBench dataset. Our study provides initial insights into the robustness and attack surface of diffusion language models and motivates the development of alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in this setting.

### [68] [Divide and Refine: Enhancing Multimodal Representation and Explainability for Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14274)
*Anh-Tuan Mai,Cam-Van Thi Nguyen,Duc-Trong Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DnR 将多模态情感识别中的模态信号显式分解为独特、冗余和协同成分，并通过定制化目标函数对其进行强化，从而提升在 IEMOCAP、MELD 上的表现，且可与各种 MERC 引擎无缝对接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核心动机是克服现有对比学习和数据增强在保持模态特异性与跨模态信号界限方面的不足；在数据预处理阶段就维护三类信息分量，以提升表征的信息性和可用性。

Method: 分阶段设计：Divide 将每个模态分解为唯一性、成对冗余和协同信息；Refine 针对这三类分量设计定制化目标，强化信息性并保持各自角色；结果表示可插拔，与不同 MERC 架构兼容；实现开源。

Result: 在 IEMOCAP 和 MELD 数据集上，针对多种 MERC 基线显示一致提升。

Conclusion: 显式分割、精炼与再结合是一种面向情感识别的 principled 策略，DnR 提供一个通用且兼容性强的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/mattam301/DnR-WACV2026

Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.

Method: 在单一模型上比较 3-8 位 K-quant 与遗留格式，测量下游任务（推理、知识、指令遵循、真实性）、困惑度、CPU 前解/解码吞吐量，以及模型大小、压缩、量化耗时等指标。

Result: 提供了基于多任务和资源预算的实用量化方案选择指南，帮助读者在实际使用中做出知情决策。

Conclusion: 通过统一的经验评估框架，明确量化方案在准确性、效率与资源需求之间的权衡，读者可据此在实际应用中选取合适的 llama.cpp 量化方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.

### [71] [On the Limits of Learned Importance Scoring for KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14279)
*Brady Steele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIP, a 1.7M-parameter non-query-aware scorer for KV cache compression, fails to outperform simple baselines. Position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N) and prefill attention perform as well or better. Marginal information in KV beyond position and prefill appears limited. Circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories may explain difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether learned, non-query-aware KV cache scorers can meaningfully improve token retention efficiency over simple heuristics, across multiple seeds, retention levels, and tasks.

Method: Introduce Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations without involving current queries. Use multi-horizon lookahead and cross-attention. Compare SIP against baselines (random, etc.), across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Test position-based heuristics (e.g., keep first 4 + last N tokens) and the effect of prefill attention.

Result: SIP does not outperform simple baselines across the evaluation settings. Position-based heuristics match or exceed learned approaches. Prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers. Marginal information in KV beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction.

Conclusion: Learned, non-query-aware KV cache scorers (SIP) offer little or no advantage over simple heuristics or prefill strategies. The difficulty may stem from circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories, implying fundamental limits to KV-based importance prediction.

Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.

TL;DR: 跨三大算法类别的结构药物设计基准测试：对15种模型在药物属性、结合亲和性及蛋白靶点的对接姿态等方面进行横向比较，揭示各类别的优势与局限，并提出将3D/1D/2D模型结合的设计思路与改进方向。代码公开在 GitHub。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结构药物设计领域缺乏跨算法的系统对比研究，难以在不同算法基础上进行公平评估并提炼各自的优劣势。建立基准测试有助于量化药物性质、对接表现与化学有效性之间的权衡，从而推动模型设计的综合改进。

Method: 建立一个横跨搜索式、深度生成、强化学习三大类的基准集，选取十五种不同模型，在指定靶蛋白上评估所生成分子的药物理化性质、对接亲和力与构象/姿态。将1D/2D的配体中心方法视为黑盒对接函数进行评估，并对多蛋白靶标进行系统比较。

Result: 在不同模型类别间呈现出明显的模式：3D结构模型在结合亲和力方面表现突出，但化学有效性和对接姿态质量存在不一致；1D模型在常规分子指标上表现可靠但难以达到最佳结合亲和力；2D模型呈现折衷的性能，化学有效性高且结合评分适中。对多目标的深入分析揭示了各类别的改进方向，为整合不同方法的优点提供了证据。代码完全公开，便于复现实验。

Conclusion: 通过系统比较不同算法基准，提出将不同方法的优势综合以克服各自局限的设计方向，并为未来SBDD模型的开发提供具体改进点与设计建议。

Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

Abstract: Tree structures appear in many fields of the life sciences, including phylogenetics, developmental biology and nucleic acid structures. Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods.

Motivation: 在硬标签黑盒设置中仅可观察到顶1标签，梯度信息极度受限，难以进行有效的对抗攻击分析或鲁棒性研究。因此需要一个从原理出发的统一视角，将现有符号翻转攻击解释为梯度符号恢复，并提出高效、可推广的攻击框架。

Method: 将现有硬标签符号翻转攻击统一为对真梯度符号的近似恢复；提出零查询频域初始化，以提高初始符号近似的方向性；再结合 Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) 进行高效的查询优化，降低查询复杂度；给出理论保证：在温和假设下，初始化的余弦相似度优于随机baseline，PDO显著降低查询成本；在 CIFAR-10、ImageNet、ObjectNet 上的广泛实验。

Result: 方法在多种模型（包括标准/对抗训练、商业 API、CLIP 等）和任务（图像分类、密集预测等）上，始终优于最先进的硬标签攻击的攻击成功率与查询效率，尤其在低查询情况下表现突出；能泛化到损坏数据、生物医学数据等场景，并成功绕过 Blacklight（检测率为0%）；代码将公开。

Conclusion: 提供了硬标签攻击的第一性原理理解，并提出普适的攻击框架，适用于多种任务与防御场景，具有潜在的安全与防御研究意义。

Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.

TL;DR: LAEP在MoE LLM的预训练阶段通过层级自适应的专家剪枝和跨设备重新组织，显著降低参数数量并提升训练效率（以1010B基线模型为例，提升约48.3%，参数减少33.3%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE LLM预训练阶段的计算瓶颈，主要来自专家资源的低利用率和训练效率不足；现有方法多在后训练阶段进行剪枝，未能在训练中直接提升效率。

Method: 在预训练阶段对每层的专家进行自适应 pruning，按 token 分布统计对专家进行跨设备重新分配和排序，以提高负载均衡和利用率；结合层级信息实现对不同层的不同剪枝策略。

Result: 通过实验，LAEP 显著降低模型规模并提升预训练效率；在从头开始预训练1010B 基线模型时，获得约48.3% 的训练效率提升和约33.3% 的参数减少，同时在多领域保持优良性能。

Conclusion: LAEP 成功将剪枝与再分布整合到 MoE 预训练阶段，证明在不显著牺牲性能的前提下提升训练效率和减少模型规模，具有实际落地潜力和扩展性。

Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

Conclusion: 方法在动态环境下提升个性化推荐效果，具备良好可部署性和策略迁移能力，适合快速变化的用户行为与奖励分布。

Abstract: Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithms are widely adopted for personalized recommendations but often struggle in dynamic environments typical of fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and dramatic shifts in reward distributions due to external influences necessitate frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system. We subsequently deployed this system to production as the default catalog personalization system in May 2025 and observed a further 0.5% revenue improvement.

### [77] [DiSPA: Differential Substructure-Pathway Attention for Drug Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14346)
*Yewon Han,Sunghyun Kim,Eunyi Jeong,Sungkyung Lee,Seokwoo Yun,Sangsoo Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSPA is a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response via bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression; it introduces a differential cross-attention module to suppress spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GDSC, especially in the disjoint-set generalization setting, with mechanistically informative attendances and zero-shot transfer from bulk to spatial transcriptomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches often treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or fuse them late, making it hard to model fine-grained, context-dependent drug action and to achieve robust interpretability in noisy, high-dimensional biological networks.

Method: DiSPA explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. It introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway–substructure associations and amplifies contextually relevant interactions. The model is evaluated on the GDSC benchmark, with strong performance in the disjoint-set setting and transferability to spatial transcriptomics.

Result: DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on the GDSC benchmark, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting that tests generalization to unseen drug–cell combinations. Beyond accuracy, its learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and show coherent organization across biological pathways. Notably, DiSPA trained on bulk RNA-seq enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics to reveal region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining.

Conclusion: DiSPA provides a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation and offering potential for cross-modality and spatial-data generalization.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug response in precision medicine requires models that capture how specific chemical substructures interact with cellular pathway states. However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.

Conclusion: VJEPA/ BJEPA 为高维、噪声环境中的自监督表示提供一个概率化、可扩展且具备不确定性处理能力的框架，促进无观测似然的鲁棒规划与零-shot任务迁移。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.

TL;DR: 在风险分数流上进行在线自适应核密度估计，将密度转换为尾部质量曲线以满足容量约束，并通过跨带宽检测到的密度谷进行“捕捉”以确定分流阈值；实现无标签、支持多队列、实时运算，更新复杂度为 O(G)，并且每个活动占用常数内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不手动设定阈值或使用 Top-K 的前提下，将连续分数流有效分流到一个或多个评审队列，同时对分布漂移、多峰性和容量约束做出自适应处理，保证吞吐与稳定性。

Method: 对分数流进行在线自适应核密度拟合，将密度转换为尾部质量曲线以匹配容量；在不同带宽下检测密度谷并将阈值“捕捉”到该谷处以实现稳定切分；该过程无标签、支持多队列路由、可在滑动窗口或指数遗忘框架下实时运行；每事件的更新复杂度为 O(G)，并且对每个活动仅占用常数内存。

Result: 在合成、漂移、多峰的流数据上实现了与容量对齐的能力，同时显著降低阈值抖动，与现有方法具有可比性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种无标签、实时且低内存开销的分流策略，利用跨带宽的密度谷鲁棒地确定分流阈值，适用于多队列扩展和动态分布的风险评分流。

Abstract: We study the problem of converting a stream of risk scores into one or more review queues under explicit intake constraints[cite: 6]. Instead of top-$K$ or manually tuned cutoffs, we fit an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transform the density into a tail-mass curve to meet capacity, and ``snap'' the resulting cut to a persistent density valley detected across bandwidths[cite: 7]. The procedure is label-free, supports multi-queue routing, and operates in real time with sliding windows or exponential forgetting[cite: 8]. On synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams, the method achieves competitive capacity adherence while reducing threshold jitter[cite: 9]. Updates cost $O(G)$ per event with constant memory per activity

Abstract: Probabilistic computing using probabilistic bits (p-bits) presents an efficient alternative to traditional CMOS logic for complex problem-solving, including simulated annealing and machine learning. Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -timing, intensity, and offset- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSR-HINE: 一个层次化隐式预测器，用多尺度潜在先验与多速率循环模块来进行长序列的混沌动力系统预测，显著缓解误差累积并保持慢模态上下文与快速尺度变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间尺度预测的混沌动力系统易产生快速误差放大与分布漂移，常规自回归模型在长程滚动中产生物理不一致性和统计崩溃，需兼顾慢模态稳定性与快速变动。

Method: 层次化隐式前馈：粗到细的潜在先验生成；一个隐式一步预测器通过多尺度潜在注入来修正状态；门控融合与后验潜在实现尺度一致的更新；轻量级隐状态校正以使记忆与融合潜在对齐。通过在不同时间尺度的多速率循环模块共同作用，保持慢尺度的长期上下文并保留快尺度的波动。

Result: 在两组基准数据集上相比U-Net自回归基线，MSR-HINE表现显著：Kuramoto–Sivashinsky在H=400时端点RMSE下降62.8%，端点ACC由-0.155提升至0.828，ACC>=0.5的可预测性区间从241步扩展至400步；Lorenz-96在H=100时RMSE下降27.0%，端点ACC由0.144提升至0.545，ACC>=0.5区间从58步扩展至100步。

Conclusion: MSR-HINE通过在多尺度潜在与时间尺度上协同建模，成功缓解混沌滚动中的误差累积，提升长程预测稳定性与可预测性，且对两组典型基准具广泛适用性。

Abstract: Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.

TL;DR: 提出一个将两大范式PINNs和神经算子(NOs)置于共同设计空间中的统一视角，基于三个维度（学习内容、物理结构嵌入方式、跨问题实例的计算负载摊销）对现有方法进行分类，从而揭示学习PDE的结构性属性带来的挑战，并促进对物理与数据结合的可靠学习型PDE求解器的发展。

Motivation: 当前缺乏对物理感知数据驱动PDE求解方法的统一理解框架，难以清晰比较不同方法的关系、局限性及在科学工作流中的角色。本工作通过将PINNs与Neural Operators放入共同设计空间，促成方法论上的整合与综合。

Method: 提出一个共享的设计空间，将现有方法从三个基本维度进行组织：1) 学习的对象（解场 vs 算子等）；2) 将物理结构嵌入学习过程的方式（物理约束、先验等）；3) 如何在不同问题实例之间分摊计算负载（跨实例摊销、一次训练多题适用性等）。通过这种结构化视角对进展进行分析。

Conclusion: 该综述提供了一个统一的分析镜像，将PINNs与Neural Operators映射到同一设计空间，推动在PDE问题上的物理数据耦合方法的设计与应用。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.

### [83] [On the Runway Cascade of Transformers for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14522)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过 runway-aware rewiring，将 runway（信息传播的间接路径）纳入直接路径注意力，使解码器自回归Transformer在不增加参数的情况下实现更平衡的信息传播，从而提升语言建模、信息检索和外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解码器自回归Transformer中，因因果遮蔽导致直接路径与中间令牌形成的间接路径信息传递存在错位，产生冗余与无关信息的级联（runway cascade），影响表示质量和下游任务性能。

Method: 提出 runway-aware rewiring，在每个令牌的直接-path注意力中嵌入 runway 语境。该机制基于对 runway 景观的摘要来重写注意力模式，使模型对累积的表征影响有意识地传播，且无需增加额外参数，可无缝集成到标准注意力。

Result: 在实验中，重连的 Transformer 在通用语言模型、信息检索和外推能力方面相对于标准 Transformer 表现出稳定提升。

Conclusion:  runway-aware rewiring 为解码器型Transformer提供了一种低成本、可集成的改进信息传播机制，缓解直接与间接信息传播错位带来的负面影响。

Abstract: In decoder-only (causal) transformers, the computation graph created by causal masking routes information through both direct-path attention and indirect paths formed by intermediate tokens. We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

### [84] [Search over Self-Edit Strategies for LLM Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14532)
*Alistair Cheong,Haolin Cong,Tyler Yang,Dustin Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can perform one-shot self-improvement by generating self-edit templates to update their weights via self-supervised next-token prediction, tested in SEAL with and without an archive of past templates. Archive improves performance relative to basic baselines but does not beat the strongest Rewrite baseline; naive archives risk homogenization, suggesting explicit novelty pressure is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate bottlenecks of freezing/fixed update rules in foundation models during open-ended search by enabling the model to drive its own data selection and training hyperparameters through feedback.

Method: Within SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setup, allow the model to generate its own self-edit templates and restrict updates to self-supervised next-token prediction. Compare two variants: no-archive and with a lightweight archive of past templates, on Qwen3-8B evaluated on SQuAD.

Result: No-archive variant matched weaker baselines; archive variant outperformed Implications and approached but did not surpass the strongest Rewrite baseline. Analysis of exploration collapse showed that naive archives can provide short-term robustness but accelerate homogenization; novelty pressure may be required for consistent gains.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates potential for model-driven, one-shot self-improvement but highlights risks of homogenization with naive template archives. To consistently exceed optimized human strategies, future work should incorporate explicit novelty pressures and better management of training data/hyperparameters, possibly beyond simple archival mechanisms.

Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

TL;DR: 提出一种无再训练的量化与内存协同设计 QMC，将权重分为 inliers 与 outliers，使用多级 ReRAM 存放 inliers、MRAM 存放高精度 outliers，在边缘设备上实现对大型语言模型的高效推理，显著降低内存、数据传输、能耗和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘端对 SLM 部署的现实需求：内存、延迟、能耗受限；量化受设备噪声影响；现有内存层级结构导致带宽瓶颈；需要面向 LLM 推理的混合内存架构。

Method: 提出 Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC)：识别 SLM 的 inlier 与 outlier 权重；将 inlier 存放于多级 ReRAM（紧凑存储）；将关键 outliers 悬留在 on-chip MRAM（高精度存储）以抗噪声；实现 retraining-free 的量化与内存协同；与不同数据格式相结合以提升压缩与推理效率。

Result: 在语言建模与推理基准上，QMC 表现优于或接近最先进的量化方法，且在算法层和现实部署下均实现更高压缩。相较于 FP16，在最新边缘 AI 平台上，QMC 将内存占用降低 6.3x-7.3x、外部数据传输降低 7.6x、能耗降低 11.7x、延迟降低 12.5x，显示其可扩展、可部署的优势。

Conclusion: QMC 提供了一种可扩展、部署就绪的边缘推理协同设计，有效缓解设备噪声与内存带宽约束，适用于边缘平台的对对大型语言模型推理。

Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

TL;DR: 将MITRE ATT&CK文本标注任务建模为分层多标签分类，使用传统机器学习在通用威胁情报文本上实现高于SOTA的准确率，且无需LLMs；GPT-4o在 tactic 级别表现较差；并发布开源模型。

Motivation: 解决手工标注耗时、成本高的问题，提出一个分层任务空间框架以系统化探索自动化标注方法，并提供可复用的工具与数据供安全社区验证与扩展，尤其扩展到金融领域的威胁情景。

Method: 对MITRE ATT&CK的术语与层级进行分层任务空间建模，提出多标签分层分类模型，在一般的威胁情报文本上进行训练与评估；与GPT-4o进行对比；公开模型与代码，并将_baseline_扩展到专家产出的一组威胁情景语料库。

Result:  tactic级准确率约94%， technique级约82%；模型达到或超过现有SOTA，且仅使用经典机器学习；GPT-4o tactic级约60%；提供可复用工具与开源代码（如GitHub项目）。

Conclusion: 分层多标签分类在MITRE ATT&CK文本标注任务中具有高效性与可扩展性，能够在不依赖大语言模型的前提下实现强性能；为安全领域的威胁情景标注提供实用、可复现的解决方案与资源。

Abstract: MITRE ATT&CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified "task space" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.

TL;DR: LLMs fine-tuned for counterfactual explanations (CFEs) yield plausible, valid, and actionable CFs in clinical sensor data; used for data augmentation to improve robustness under label scarcity, outperforming optimization-based baselines in plausibility, validity, and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在生成对比因果解释（CFE）方面的能力，探讨其作为干预手段与数据增强的潜力，提升传感器基础数字健康模型的可解释性、鲁棒性和数据效率。

Method: 在多模态AI-READI临床数据集上，比较GPT-4（零-shot与少-shot）及BioMistral-7B、LLaMA-3.1-8B等开源模型在预训练与微调条件下的CF生成。评价维度包括干预质量、特征多样性和增强效果；对比DiCE、CFNOW、NICE等优化基线；对数据增强情景进行标签稀缺下的模型鲁棒性评估。

Result: 微调后的LLMs，尤其是LLaMA-3.1-8B，生成的CFs具有高可信度（可置信度达99%）、强有效性（至0.99）及现实且可行为调整的特征改变；用于数据增强时，在三种稀缺情景下平均实现20%的F1回升；与优化基线相比，LLMs在临床可操作性和语义连贯性方面更优。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的对照因果解释在可解释干预设计与数据高效训练方面展现出潜力，SenseCF对LLM进行微调以生成有效、代表性的CF，并帮助不平衡数据中的少数类，提高模型鲁棒性和预测性能。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.
  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance

Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.

TL;DR: 提出两种基于 Muon 的变体 Muon-NSR 与 Muon-VS，通过对动量进行正交化前的方差自适应归一化，提升大语言模型预训练的收敛速度与验证损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大模型成本高，优化器效率成为关键；在现有 Adam 的符号更新基础上，探索与正交化相关的动量更新以提高收敛性。

Method: 在 Muon 框架上引入两种变体：NSR（噪声对比信号比）和 VS（方差基缩放），对动量在正交化前进行方差自适应归一化；NSR 通过噪声-信号比进行调制，VS 进行方差基础缩放且不引入额外超参数。

Result: 在 GPT-2 和 LLaMA 预训练中，方法加速收敛并得到更低的验证损失，优于经过调优的 AdamW 及 Muon 基线；在 LLaMA-1.2B 上，Muon-NSR 与 Muon-VS 相对最近基准的调优 Muon，使达到目标验证损失所需的迭代次数减少约 1.36 倍。

Conclusion: 两变体验证了对动量正交化过程引入方差自适应归一化的有效性，能在不增加超参数的情况下提升预训练效率与性能，具有实用性与推广价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.

### [90] [Relational Graph Modeling for Credit Default Prediction: Heterogeneous GNNs and Hybrid Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14633)
*Yvonne Yang,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Massive-scale heterogeneous graph for credit default risk, where hybrid models combining tabular features and GNN embeddings outperform standalone GNNs; contrastive pretraining stabilizes training but yields limited downstream gains; explainability and fairness analyses are conducted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capture cross-entity dependencies in multi-table financial histories to improve credit scoring and fairness, by integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities in a large heterogeneous graph.

Method: Construct a heterogeneous graph with over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower features with granular transaction-level entities (installment payments, POS cash balances, credit card histories). Evaluate heterogeneous GNNs (heterogeneous GraphSAGE, relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN) against strong tabular baselines. Also assess a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived embeddings; investigate contrastive pretraining with generic graph augmentations; perform structured explainability and fairness analyses.

Result: Standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline. The hybrid ensemble that combines tabular features with GNN embeddings achieves the best performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. Contrastive pretraining improves optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Explainability and fairness analyses reveal how relational signals influence subgroup behavior and screening outcomes.

Conclusion: GNNs add value mainly when used to augment strong tabular models; coupling relational representations with tabular features yields the strongest predictive gains. Contrastive pretraining can stabilize training but may not translate into substantial performance gains without task-aligned augmentations. Relational signals have notable implications for fairness and subgroup behavior, warranting careful explainability and fairness considerations.

Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.
  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.

Abstract: Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis.

Conclusion: 该工作揭示FRL的新型脆弱性，强调需要针对排序型联邦学习的更强防御措施；同时提供代码以便复现实验与防御研究。

Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA

Conclusion: 提供一种新的扩 scaling 方向，结合多解采样、扩展 rollout 与模型合并，显著提升LRM的推理稳定性与效率，推动对复杂推理任务的能力提升。

Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.

Conclusion: IBMDP 为数据丰富但缺乏仿真器的序列实验设计提供实用解法，集成规划提高决策质量与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.

Conclusion: 通过将内部信息流与外部结构博弈结合，FSX 提供更忠实、可高效推理的解释框架，揭示模型推理中的结构性机理。

Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

### [97] [Mechanism Shift During Post-training from Autoregressive to Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14758)
*Injin Kong,Hyoungjoon Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training diffusion reconfigures internal computation: MDMs shift from autoregressive to distributed processing, enabling global planning; mechanism shift depends on task structure; local tasks preserve ARMs-like circuitry while global planning shows rewired, early-layer emphasis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear whether post-trained MDMs exhibit genuine bidirectional reasoning or simply reuse autoregressive heuristics; need to uncover internal algorithmic transformations from ARMs to MDMs at the circuit level.

Method: Comparative circuit analysis of autoregressive models and their masked-diffusion counterparts, examining how structural task properties (local vs global dependencies) influence circuitry; assessment of initialization pathways, early-layer processing, and semantic specialization vs integration.

Result: Identification of a systematic mechanism shift: MDMs largely retain ARMs circuitry for local causal tasks but discard initialized pathways for global planning, with increased early-layer processing and a shift toward distributed integration.

Conclusion: Diffusion post-training reorganizes internal computation in a fundamental way to support non-sequential, globally planning behavior, not merely adjusting parameters.

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

Conclusion: 有限差异搜索为连续特征下的最优决策树学习提供了一种有效的 anytime、完备解法，具有更好的实用性和稳健性，建议在需要随时可用高质量模型的场景中采用。

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.

Method: 在等参数规模的设定下建立理论分析，比较 MoE 与密集模型在特征噪声下的表现，推导泛化误差界与收敛性，辅以合成数据与真实语言任务的实验验证。

Result: 在特征噪声存在时，稀疏专家激活降低泛化误差、提高对扰动的鲁棒性、加快收敛；实验结果支持理论结论，MoE 的鲁棒性与效率提升得到一致性证据。

Conclusion: 稀疏的模块化计算通过噪声过滤作用，为 MoE 提供鲁棒性与效率优势，理论分析与实验结果相互印证。

Abstract: Despite their practical success, it remains unclear why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models can outperform dense networks beyond sheer parameter scaling. We study an iso-parameter regime where inputs exhibit latent modular structure but are corrupted by feature noise, a proxy for noisy internal activations. We show that sparse expert activation acts as a noise filter: compared to a dense estimator, MoEs achieve lower generalization error under feature noise, improved robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence speed. Empirical results on synthetic data and real-world language tasks corroborate the theoretical insights, demonstrating consistent robustness and efficiency gains from sparse modular computation.

Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.

Conclusion: 该框架在理论与实验层面均证明了对高斯后验的显著优势，提供了一个稳定、鲁棒且可扩展的BBVI方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.

Motivation: 推理模型在编码与数学推理等任务中性能突出但推理速度慢，低比特量化对准确率影响显著，需通过训练期量化策略提升推理效率与精度。

Result: 在 SFT 与 RL 两类训练下，知识蒸馏被证实为鲁棒目标；PTQ 能为 QAT 提供强初始化，提升精度并降低训练成本；在具备冷启动条件下，RL 在量化模型中也可行且带来额外收益；对齐 PTQ 校准域和 QAT 训练域可加速收敛且提升最终精度；Reasoning-QAT 在多种后端与数据集上持续优于现有 PTQ 方法；例如在 Qwen3-0.6B 上，MATH-500 的提升达到 44.53%，且在 2 位量化时能恢复性能。

Conclusion: 将 PTQ 与 QAT 的优点整合成一个高效工作流 Reasoning-QAT，稳健超越现有 PTQ 基线，具有良好的泛化性，适用于多种推理任务和模型。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.

Conclusion: 该三阶段框架有效兼顾通信效率与推理鲁棒性，适用于多模态边缘学习场景，提升分布式学习在无线链路中的实用性。

Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

*Han Li,Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种融合外部证据与伪造特征的多模态谣言检测模型，通过对比学习和自适应融合，在 Weibo 和 Twitter 数据集上优于主流 baselines。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中混合图文的谣言传播日益猖獗，单纯基于文本或图像的检测难以有效发现语义不一致和伪造内容。现有多模态方法存在特征提取不足、对齐噪声、融合策略僵化，以及缺乏外部事实证据来核验复杂谣言的问题。

Method: 使用 ResNet34 作为视觉编码器、BERT 作为文本编码器；增加伪造特征模块，通过傅里叶变换提取频域痕迹和压缩伪影；BLIP 生成的图像描述用于桥接图像与文本语义；引入双对比学习，在文本-图像和文本-描述之间计算对比损失以提升语义不一致检测；采用门控自适应特征尺度融合机制动态调节多模态融合，降低冗余。

Result: 在微博与推特数据集上，模型在宏平均准确率、召回率和F1等指标上显著优于主流基线。

Conclusion: 通过整合外部证据、伪造特征、跨模态对比学习与自适应融合，提升对复杂混合媒体谣言的鲁棒性和检测性能。

Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

TL;DR: 提出 DEGen 与新的 regret 估计 MNA，用于无监督环境设计的 RL 训练课程生成；通过密集奖励信号和更有效的难度量化来提升在大规模环境中的泛化和零样本表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UED 旨在自动生成 RL 训练课程以提升泛化，但在环境参数子集导致任务复杂性显著增加的情形下，设计有效课程困难；现有方法依赖的遗憾近似难以进行有效信用分配，且规模增大时问题更加显著。

Method: 提出 Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen)，以产生更密集的环境等级奖励信号，缓解信用分配难题并提高对大规模环境的可扩展性；同时引入 Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA) 作为改进的遗憾近似，用以更好识别具有挑战性的等级。将 DEGen 与 MNA 结合，达到优于现有方法的效果，且代码公开。

Result: 经验结果表明，MNA 优于现有遗憾近似；结合 DEGen 时，整体表现优于现有方法，尤其在环境规模增大时更明显。

Conclusion: 该方法通过密集奖励信号和更强的难度识别，提升 UED 在更大环境中的可扩展性和性能；为 RL 的自适应课程设计提供更有效的工具，同时提供可重复的代码实现。

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InstructTime及InstructTime++，将时序分类从判别式映射转为多模态生成任务，通过时序离散化、对齐投影和自监督预训练实现跨模态对齐，进一步通过隐式特征建模提升性能。实验表明在多数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序分类多采用直接映射到类别标签的判别式方法，难以融入上下文特征并捕捉类别之间的语义关系；需要一种统一的跨模态生成框架以利用文本、指令等信息提升分类效果。

Method: 将连续时间序列量化为离散时间令牌，建立对齐投影层，使用生成式自监督预训练实现跨模态对齐；语言模型输出文本标签。InstructTime++引入隐式特征建模，通过统计特征、视觉语言的图片描述等方式提取隐含模式并转化为文本描述以供融合。

Conclusion: 将时序分类重新定义为多模态生成任务可更好地利用上下文和语义关系，InstructTime提供新的研究方向；InstructTime++通过隐式特征补充弥补语言模型的 inductive bias，从而进一步提升性能与表达能力。

Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种回归式模型 L-RAPM，用于估计篮球阵容在对抗中表现，通过控制对手并利用阵容成分信息来应对数据稀疏问题；相较于基线，在预测能力方面有提升，且提升在阵容样本越少时越明显。

Motivation: NBA 等体育比赛中阵容替换频繁，导致极度稀疏的数据；单个阵容的出场次数有限，统计噪声大，亟需能在稀疏数据下估计阵容效应的方法。

Method: 提出回归基础的 L-RAPM，同时对阵容所面对的对手进行控制，并利用阵容中球员的特征信息来建模阵容效应，可能将对手效应和球员效应分解为可估的参数。

Result: 实验结果显示 L-RAPM 的预测能力优于当前基线，且当阵容样本较小时，改进程度更大。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解阵容数据的稀疏性问题，提升阵容预测与分析的准确性，具有阵容优化和对抗策略制定的潜在应用。

Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.

### [111] [RadixMLP - Intra-batch Deduplication for Causal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15013)
*Michael Feil,Julius Lipp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RadixMLP 提出了一种利用前缀树结构的 MLP 位置化统计来消除重复计算的技术，用于因果Transformer在批量推理中的共有前缀场景。通过将批量映射到前缀树，聚合共享前缀的计算并在注意力边界处再将结果散回，RadixMLP 实现单次前向传播、无状态的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量推理中许多序列具有共享的前缀（系统提示、few-shot 示例、公共查询等），标准推理引擎对每个序列独立计算，导致对相同的 MLP 激活重复多次，存在显著冗余。需在不改变模型结构的前提下高效复用前缀计算以提升吞吐。

Method: 基于位置相关的计算特性，RadixMLP 将批量动态映射到前缀树（prefix trie），将共享段聚合为压缩表示以进行逐位置的计算（MLP、LayerNorm、线性投影、嵌入等），并在完成后仅在注意力边界处将结果散回回去。该方法是无状态的，且在单次前向传递内完成。

Result: 在 MS MARCO v1.1 的端到端服务基准上，使用 Qwen3 系列模型（0.6B–8B 参数），RadixMLP 在重排/重新排序工作负载中实现约 1.44–1.59 倍的加速；在具有更长共享前缀的合成基准上可达到最高约 5 倍加速。

Conclusion: RadixMLP 为带共享前缀的批量推理提供了实用且无状态的加速方案，能显著降低重复 MLP 及相关层的计算开销，且实现简单、可在端到端服务中使用，代码公开（GitHub）。该方法的思想可扩展到其他前缀重用场景。

Abstract: Batch inference workloads for causal transformer models frequently process sequences that share common prefixes, such as system prompts, few-shot examples, or shared queries. Standard inference engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix. We introduce RadixMLP, a technique that exploits the position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings to eliminate this redundancy. RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. RadixMLP is stateless and operates within a single forward pass. In end-to-end serving benchmarks on MS~MARCO v1.1 with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59$\times$ speedups in realistic reranking workloads, with up to $5\times$ speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes. Our code is available at https://github.com/michaelfeil/radix-mlp.

Conclusion:  FluidGym 首次提供可微分、可扩展的 AFC RL 基准，促进方法对比与集成研究，并在 GitHub 上公开资源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在 CIFAR-10 上对 Dense、SoftMoE、SparseMoE 分类头进行比较，结果显示 MoE 在等容量条件下略增验证准确率并维持均衡的专家利用，但实际推理速度提升未显现；SoftMoE 展现更高的曲率尖度，而 Dense/SparseMoE 的曲率相似；损失表面扰动分析揭示非局部行为差异；结论指出需硬件与路由实现优化以兑现 MoE 的潜在加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 MoE 在视觉分类中的行为特征，评估其对预测性能、专家利用、泛化和推理效率的影响，并与 Dense 基线对比，尤其比较 SoftMoE 与 SparseMoE 的表现及其与曲率特征之间的关系。

Method: 在等容量条件下，比较 Dense、SoftMoE、SparseMoE 分类头在 CIFAR-10 上的性能；通过正则化确保专家利用均衡，避免专家崩溃；计算训练与测试集上的 Hessian 最大特征值与迹以衡量曲率；进行损失表面扰动分析以评估非局部行为；评估推理效率，验证简单条件路由是否在现代硬件上带来加速。

Result: 所有 MoE 变体在验证集准确率上略高于 Dense；SoftMoE 具有更高的曲率指标（最大特征值与迹），Dense 与 SparseMoE 的曲率相近；泛化性能相近；损失表面扰动显示非局部行为差异；纯路由实现未在现代硬件上实现推理加速，体现理论与实现之间的差距。

Conclusion: MoE 在视觉分类中可提升准确率并保持较好专家利用，曲率分析表明 SoftMoE 的尖度较高但未直接解释泛化差异；要实现实际推理加速需在路由实现与硬件协同方面进行优化，方能缩小理论潜力与实际性能之间的差距。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable conditional computation by routing inputs to multiple expert subnetworks and are often motivated as a mechanism for scaling large language models. In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

### [116] [Auditing Language Model Unlearning via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15111)
*Anmol Goel,Alan Ritter,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PID-based auditing reveals residual, redundant information about forgotten data persists after language-model unlearning and correlates with adversarial leakage; introduces a representation-based risk score to decide abstention at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between claimed effectiveness of unlearning and actual retention of information in internal representations. An interpretable, formal audit is needed to quantify and mitigate privacy leakage.

Method: Develop an interpretable information-theoretic framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to decompose mutual information between forgotten data and model representations into redundant, unique, and synergistic components, comparing representations before and after unlearning to identify residual knowledge; validate with reconstruction-attacking correlations; propose a risk-score based on representations to guide abstention.

Result: Redundant information shared across models persists post-unlearning and constitutes residual knowledge; this residual correlates with vulnerability to known reconstruction attacks; a representation-based risk score is proposed to enable abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, yielding theoretical insights and practical tools to improve safe deployment of language models by diagnosing and mitigating privacy leakage.

Abstract: We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.

Method: 提出双模态统一检索模块：语义存储来自前缀结构化文本；结构存储来自基于中心性度量的 motif。设计双视图对齐以同时捕捉内容与关系模式；通过上下文增强（in-context augmentation）将检索文本与 motif 作为证据用于下游任务。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上进行的大规模实验显示，RAG-GFM 在跨域节点分类和图分类任务上持续优于13个state-of-the-art baselines，体现出更高的效果与效率。

Conclusion: 将知识从模型参数中解耦并外部化，提升下游适应性、扩展性与可解释性；检索-增强框架对图任务具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 在稀疏回报下，RL训练的Transformer会自发地收敛到一个可解释的逐步图遍历算法；“简单样本”的分布对是否能推广到更长链路至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示稀疏奖励如何通过梯度流驱动模型学会链式推理（CoT），并在受控合成任务与实际语言模型任务中验证机制。

Method: 对单层 Transformer 在一个需要 CoT 的合成图遍历任务上的梯度流动进行理论分析，证明在仅以最终答案正确性作为训练信号时，梯度会驱动模型收敛到逐步、可解释的节点遍历算法；并刻画“简单样本”在分布中的作用及其对可推广性的影响，随后在合成数据和真实语言模型的数学推理任务上进行实验以验证理论。

Result: 理论结果表明，稀疏回报下的梯度流可促使模型形成结构化的、可解释的图遍历策略；当训练分布中包含足量的简单示例时，该策略能泛化至更长的推理链；反之，若简单示例的质量或数量不足，梯度学习将变得不可行。实验支持理论，且在实际语言模型的任务中也观察到类似现象。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了稀疏回报驱动下的CoT形成机制，强调数据分布（尤其是简单样本的存在与否）对模型推理能力的影响，并提示在设计训练分布时需关注样本难度结构以实现对更长推理链的泛化。

Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

*Dhrubo Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZENITH is a zero-overhead LR optimizer that adapts the learning rate from the temporal evolution of the gradient norm, outperforming baselines in CNN classification and MS COCO tasks, while being compatible with regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual LR schedule tuning and existing adaptive optimizers incur computational/memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. A lightweight, history-informed LR adaptation could improve efficiency and generalization.

Method: ZENITH uses the temporal evolution of the gradient norm (training history) to adapt the learning rate with zero extra overhead, avoiding additional memory/computation and being compatible with regularization.

Result: In image classification across 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks, ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy with lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yields superior mAP in MS COCO object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation using the R-CNN family. Regularization compatibility further improves generalization.

Conclusion: ZENITH provides an efficient, regularization-friendly LR adaptation mechanism that improves both training efficiency and model performance across vision tasks.

Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.

Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.
