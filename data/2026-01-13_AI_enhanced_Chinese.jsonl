Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods. Beyond social choice, SP-Rank supports downstream applications in learning-to-rank, extracting expert knowledge from noisy crowds, and training reward models in preference-based fine-tuning pipelines. We release the dataset, code, and baseline evaluations (available at https://github.com/amrit19/SP-Rank-Dataset ) to foster research in human preference modeling, aggregation theory, and human-AI alignment.", "code_url": "https://github.com/amrit19/SP-Rank-Datase", "AI": {"tldr": "SP-Rank \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u4e2a\u4eba\u6295\u7968\uff09\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u4ed6\u4eba\u6295\u7968\u7684\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u57fa\u51c6\u663e\u793a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u63d0\u5347 Ground-truth \u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SP-Rank \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08>1.2\u4e07 datapoints\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5730\u7406\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u3001\u7ed8\u753b\u7b493\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u542b9\u79cd elicitation formats\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca SP-Voting \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u7eaf\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e24\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5305\u62ec\u5b8c\u6574 ground-truth \u6392\u5e8f\u6062\u590d\u3001\u5b50\u96c6\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6295\u7968\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6295\u7968\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5168\u91cf\u548c\u5b50\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u63a8\u52a8\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u4f17\u5305\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u504f\u597d\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment.

With limited staff support, exhaustive reading during hearings is impractical. We present CourtNav, a voice-guided, anchor-first navigator for legal PDFs that maps a judge's spoken command (e.g., \"go to paragraph 23\", \"highlight the contradiction in the cross-examination\") directly to a highlighted paragraph in seconds. CourtNav transcribes the command, classifies intent with a grammar-first(Exact regex matching), LLM-backed router classifying the queries using few shot examples, retrieves over a layout-aware hybrid index, and auto-scrolls the viewer to the cited span while highlighting it and close alternates. By design, the interface shows only grounded passages, never free text, keeping evidence verifiable and auditable. This need is acute in India, where judgments and cross-examinations are notoriously long.In a pilot on representative charge sheets, pleadings, and orders, median time-to-relevance drops from 3-5 minutes (manual navigation) to 10-15 seconds; with quick visual verification included, 30-45 seconds.

Recent foundation models for transaction analysis process tabular data sequentially but rely on index-based representations for categorical merchant fields, causing substantial semantic information loss by converting rich textual data into discrete tokens. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can address this limitation through superior semantic understanding, their computational overhead challenges real-time financial deployment. We introduce a hybrid framework that uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight transaction models, balancing interpretability with operational efficiency.

The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a \"table of media-bias elements\". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition.

This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance.

To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7d22\u5f15\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u68c0\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7ea7\u8054\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u5355\u53ec\u56de\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea627%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u95fb\u76f8\u5173\u8d8b\u52bf\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u56e0\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u70b9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7d22\u5f15\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u9759\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u68c0\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ea7\u8054\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5355\u53ec\u56de\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4ee5\u5fae\u8c03\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6b63\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u6bd4\u63d0\u534727%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u67e5\u8be2\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6865\u63a5\u9759\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLCL\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548cIgbo\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u53c2\u6570\u503c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u82e5\u5e72\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u53d1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMLCL\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001Igbo\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u82e5\u5e72\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u53d1\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5931\u8d25\u6765\u81ea\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u88ab\u8fdd\u80cc\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u503c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08parameter value language mismatch\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6267\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u3002\u67d0\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a simplified yet effective framework that leverages prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought task decomposition to guide reasoning within a single large language model. Specifically, our approach decomposes the relevance judgment process into four interpretable subtasks: translation, intent understanding, category matching, and relevance judgment -- and fine-tunes a base model (Qwen2.5-14B) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. This design not only reduces computational and storage overhead but also enhances interpretability by explicitly structuring the model's reasoning path. Experimental results show that our single-model framework achieves competitive accuracy and high inference efficiency, processing 20 samples per second on a single A100 GPU.

Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\\mfmd). In this work, we propose \\mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \\mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \\mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u5408\u4f5c\uff1a\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u4f5c\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540e\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff1b\u4eba\u683c\u4f5c\u7528\u504f\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76Big Five\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9LLM\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u663e\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9GPT-3.5-turbo\u3001GPT-4o\u3001GPT-5\u8fdb\u884cBig Five Inventory\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u72ec\u7acb\u64cd\u7eb5\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81f3\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u663e\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e9\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u88ab\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u540e\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "EquFL \u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u4e00\u4e2a\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u5230 FedAvg \u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u6216\u5728\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eaf\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u3001\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u6574\u5408\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u6536\u5230\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u540e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c0f\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230 FedAvg \u90a3\u6837\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u8bc1\u660e EquFL \u6536\u655b\u81f3\u4e0e FedAvg \u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u51cf\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e EquFL \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EquFL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u65e0\u987b\u4fee\u6539\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the increasing volume of user-generated reviews has led to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to identify content that aligns with their specific preferences. Existing review ranking systems typically rely on metrics such as helpfulness votes, star ratings, and recency, but these fail to capture individual user interests and often treat textual sentiment and rating signals separately. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions. A relevance scoring algorithm matched these profiles with unseen reviews based on sentiment and aspect similarity. Top-matched reviews were then summarized to reflect individual interests. A user study with 70 participants demonstrated that the personalized approach improved satisfaction, perceived relevance, and decision-making confidence, while reducing time spent reading. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in alleviating information overload and delivering content tailored to user-specific preferences, emphasizing its value in enhancing user experience in review-rich decision-making environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u753b\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9605\u8bfb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u661f\u7ea7\u548c\u65f6\u6548\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4e14\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u5e38\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u661f\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u753b\u50cf\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u753b\u50cf\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8981\u70b9\uff08aspect\uff09\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\uff1b4) \u9009\u53d6\u9876\u7ea7\u5339\u914d\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c abstractive summarization\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u4f53\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "result": "70\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6574\u5408\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts.

We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\u03ba= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality.

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs.

Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search.

The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the \"competence paradox\" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks. Overall, the paper argues for epistemic fidelity over surface realism as a prerequisite for using LLM-based simulated students as reliable scientific and pedagogical instruments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5 Epistemic State Specification (ESS) \u548c Goal-by-Environment \u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u805a\u7126 epistemic fidelity \u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u201c\u80fd\u529b\u6096\u8bba\u201d\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4eff\u771f\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u4eff\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49 Epistemic State Specification (ESS)\u6765\u9650\u5b9a\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Goal-by-Environment \u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4eff\u771f\u7cfb\u7edf\u653e\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff1b\u7efc\u5408\u68b3\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0 epistemic fidelity\uff1b\u672a\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8ba8\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03 epistemic fidelity \u76f8\u8f83\u8868\u5c42\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06LLM\u4eff\u771f\u5b66\u751f\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u524d\u63d0\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u805a\u7126\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728IL\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u901a\u7528DAgger\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u968f\u673a/\u4ea4\u4e92\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728IL\u7528\u4e8eSDP\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55DAgger\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u6309\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684DAgger\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u805a\u5408\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u4e92\u52a8\uff1b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u533b\u5e08-\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6765\u81ea\u968f\u673a/\u968f\u673a\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6240\u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1IL\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5f15\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u65f6\u53ef\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a/\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6216\u805a\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002"}}

Current methods partition documents individually, but complex queries need information scattered across multiple sources: the knowledge fragmentation problem. We introduce Cross-Document Topic-Aligned (CDTA) chunking, which reconstructs knowledge at the corpus level. It first identifies topics across documents, maps segments to each topic, and synthesizes them into unified chunks.\n  On HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning, our method reached 0.93 faithfulness versus 0.83 for contextual retrieval and 0.78 for semantic chunking, a 12% improvement over current industry best practice (p < 0.05).

While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MisBelief \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u8de8\u591a\u89d2\u8272 LLM \u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b3a\u9a97\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u5ff5\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u3001\u53ef\u8fa9\u89e3\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u9010\u6b65 refinement \u53ef\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u5c11\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u53ef\u8fa9\u8bc1\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "MisBelief \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u534f\u540c\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u7684 LLM \u751f\u6210 4,800 \u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e09\u79cd\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30 7 \u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027 LLM \u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u63d0\u51fa DIS\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u8b66\u793a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u5ff5\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7ecf\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001\u5177\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6781\u6613\u88ab\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8bf4\u670d\uff0cfalsehood \u4fe1\u5ff5\u5e73\u5747\u4e0a\u5347 93.0%\uff1bDIS \u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u5ff5\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bc1\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5177\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cLLM \u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0cDIS \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines.

While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MemBuilder\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec34B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f52\u56e0\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u5f00\u653e/\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5e94\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MemBuilder\uff1a\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a20\u5bc6\u4e2d\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8d21\u732e\u611f\u77e5\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u4ee5\u6309\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f71\u54cd\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "4B \u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MemBuilder \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f52\u56e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches.

Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%.

While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship.

Specifically, we enable the draft model to execute iterative retrieval speculations to break the theoretical speedup limits; to alleviate rejections without rollback, the target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance. \\textsc{Double} is entirely training-free and lossless. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art speedup of $\\textbf{5.3}\\times$ on LLaMA3.3-70B and $\\textbf{2.8}\\times$ on Qwen3-32B, significantly outperforming the advanced method EAGLE-3 that requires extensive model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Double \u5f15\u5165\u540c\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6865\u63a5 SD \u4e0e PSD\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u7406\u8bba\u52a0\u901f\u4e0a\u9650\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u5230 5.3\u00d7\uff08LLaMA3.3-70B\uff09\u548c 2.8\u00d7\uff08Qwen3-32B\uff09", "motivation": "PSD/SD \u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1aDraft \u4e0e Target \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5de8\u989d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "Double \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8349\u7a3f\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u63a8\u6d4b\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u7406\u8bba\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u6743\u5a01\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a token \u6307\u5f15\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u56e0\u62d2\u7edd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u62d2\u7edd\u9020\u6210\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230 5.3\u00d7 \u4e0e 2.8\u00d7 \u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 EAGLE-3\u3002", "conclusion": "Double \u89e3\u51b3 Retrieval Precision-Efficiency Dilemma\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u635f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u76f4\u8fbe\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u9519\u8bef\u5373\u53ef\u81f4\u547d\uff1b\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u3001\u81f4\u547d\u540e\u679c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e03\u9879\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a Complete Information\u3001Incomplete Information\u3001Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR) \u4e09\u7c7b\u3002Complete Information \u4f7f\u7528 ASCII \u5730\u56fe\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u6b67\u4e49\uff1bIncomplete Information \u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1bSOSR \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u751f\u547d\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u4e0eVLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce81%\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u653e\u5927\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u82e5\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5728 ASCII \u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u52300% \u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u706b\u707e\u6f14\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5411\u5371\u9669\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u9003\u751f\u51fa\u53e3\u3002\u5f3a\u8c031%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\uff1b\u5373\u4fbf\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u58f0\u79f0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u598299%\uff09\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684LLMs\u5c1a\u672a\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b83\u4eec\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Preprint; work in progress", "summary": "Modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle with a fundamental architectural tension: vector indices are optimized for query latency but poorly handle continuous knowledge updates, while data lakes excel at versioning but introduce query latency penalties. We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices). The approach enables production RAG deployments requiring simultaneous optimization for query performance, update efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALVGL\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f+\u4f4e\u79c3\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u7528ADMM\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7684\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u9ad8\u65af/\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709/\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u590d\u6742\u3001\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u6613\u5931\u6548\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f+\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5ADMM\u4f18\u5316\u8be5\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u5206\u7ec4\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u65e0\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cALVGL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5176\u6240\u6784\u9020\u7684\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5177\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ALVGL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f+\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cdSCM\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa WildSci \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u8bae\u6587\u732e\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d69\u5927\u5b66\u79d1\u300126\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d69\u4e2a\u5b66\u79d1\u548c26\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u660e\u786e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7ec4\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff1b\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "WildSci \u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far.

To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises.

Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price.

Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{Z}eroth- and \\textbf{F}irst-\\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones.

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL-based post-training of lightweight LLMs for e-commerce fraud detection using GSPO with a rule-based reward on raw transaction data; real dataset shows improved F1 on held-out data, driven by exploration to find novel fraud signals.", "motivation": "LLMs have potential for fraud detection but limited empirical validation in real-world financial contexts; need to overcome traditional ML limitations and leverage domain-specific textual transaction data to detect fraud more effectively.", "method": "Post-train lightweight language models with reinforcement learning using the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm and a rule-based reward on raw transaction data (customer info, shipping, product descriptions, order history) from a real dataset; RL exploration encourages discovery of trust/risk signals beyond engineered features.", "result": "Significant improvements in F1-score on held-out test data; performance gains mainly attributed to the exploration mechanism of RL enabling discovery of novel fraud indicators not captured by traditional features.", "conclusion": "RL-based post-training can unlock the latent fraud-detection potential of LLMs on real e-commerce data, offering practical benefits beyond traditional ML approaches and highlighting the importance of exploration in identifying novel fraud signals."}}

Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as \"Reasoning + X\", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters.

Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLMs\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faTokens Per Correctness (TPC) \u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03 OverSearchQA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u62d2\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Tokens Per Correctness (TPC) \u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5c42\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u5c42\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u516c\u5f00 OverSearchQA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u641c\u7d22\u5728\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u524a\u5f31\u62d2\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2) \u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u7d22\u653e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\uff1b3) \u8bc1\u636e\u7ec4\u6210\u5bf9\u62d2\u7b54\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u8bc1\u636e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u62d2\u7b54\u6548\u679c\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 TPS\uff08TPC\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u6210\u672c-\u6548\u76ca\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5c42\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03 OverSearchQA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces a causal learning framework to extend ULTR for unbiased ranking by modeling click generation with SCMs, measuring bias leakage via conditional mutual information, and regularizing training to disentangle true relevance from biases; uses a doubly robust estimator for reliable risk estimation and achieves improved ranking under multiple interacting biases.", "motivation": "Limitations of existing ULTR methods: primarily address position bias via propensity estimation, but fail to quantify residual bias or guarantee risk, and struggle with multiple interacting biases such as position and trust bias.", "method": "Builds a Structural Causal Model of click generation, defines a bias leakage measure using conditional mutual information between observed clicks and true relevance given the model, and optimizes a loss with a disentanglement regularizer plus a doubly robust risk estimator.", "result": "Empirical evaluation on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks shows reduced bias leakage and improved ranking performance, particularly when multiple biases interact.", "conclusion": "A unified causal-learning approach that (i) quantifies and regularizes bias leakage, (ii) extends ULTR beyond position bias, and (iii) provides more reliable risk estimates, leading to better ranking under realistic multi-bias scenarios."}}

Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup. We run a suite of experiments on ranking tasks derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ESCI (Reddy et al., arXiv:2206.06588).

Evidence on joint destination choice", "comment": "23 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Social activities result from complex joint activity-travel decisions between group members. While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based analysis for incorporating non-traditional data sources on social activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5206\u6790\u65e5\u672c\u7fa4\u804a\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5c31\u9910\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65c5\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7fa4\u4f53\u5171\u540c\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7fa4\u804a\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3002LLMs\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u8f85\u52a9\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\u7684 prompting \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6b65\u63d0\u53d6\u6838\u5fc3\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9910\u5385\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u5404\u5907\u9009\u9009\u9879\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d\u3001\u9a71\u52a8\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u6355\u6349\u663e\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u65b9\u9762\u8f83\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u9690\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u88ab\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u63a7\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u5999\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5c06\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4f1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6 MLA-STNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cdMamba-\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4e0e\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u5448\u7c07\u72b6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u5608\u6742\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u52a0\u4e4b\u6cbb\u7406\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e0e\u62a5\u544a\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u9632\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "method": "MLA-STNet \u5305\u542b\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) STG-MA\uff08\u65f6\u7a7a\u5730\u7406\u7684Mamba\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2) STS-MA\uff08\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684Mamba\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u65e5\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9 NYC \u4e0e Chicago \u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u768475\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cRMSE \u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u591a6%\uff0cRecall \u63d0\u9ad88%\uff0cMAP \u63d0\u9ad85%\uff1b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u8fbe50%\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u9632\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e MLA-STNet \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u8d28\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs.

While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors.

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies.

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting.

This study addresses this critical gap by investigating automatic text detoxification (toxic to neutral rewriting) for two low-resource African languages, isiXhosa and Yor\u00f9b\u00e1. The work contributes a novel, pragmatic hybrid methodology: a lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and a controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites, which captures idiomatic usage, diacritics, and code switching, was developed to train and evaluate the model. The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yor\u00f9b\u00e1), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences. These results demonstrate that scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer (TST) in African languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u53bb\u6bd2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 isiXhosa \u4e0e Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 \u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u7ed3\u5408 TF-IDF + \u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47/\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u5230\u4e2d\u6027\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5728\u4e24\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u91cd\u5199\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u6bd2\u6027\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6587\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728 African \u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53cb\u597d\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u53bb\u6bd2\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\uff1aTF-IDF \u7279\u5f81 + Logistic Regression\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u91cd\u5199\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5178\u4e0e token \u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u91cd\u5199\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u6bd2\u6027-\u4e2d\u6027\u91cd\u5199\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e60\u60ef\u7528\u8bed\u3001\u53d8\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42 K \u6298\u3001\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c ROC-AUC\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1aisiXhosa 61\u201372%\uff0cYor\u00f9b\u00e1 72\u201386%\uff1bROC-AUC \u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe 0.88\u3002\u91cd\u5199\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u53e5\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u975e\u6bd2\u6027\u53e5\u5b50\u4fdd\u6301 100% \u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9762\u5411\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6587\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a African \u8bed\u8a00\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u4e5f\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression.

This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit \"OR\" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit \"AND\" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator.

While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multilingual unlearning evaluated on Aya-Expanse 8B across 10 languages; data vs concept unlearning; higher stability in high-resource languages; asymmetric transfer among related languages; syntactic similarity best predicts cross-lingual unlearning behavior.", "motivation": "Address safety and fairness of multilingual LLMs by studying unlearning in multilingual settings; extend unlearning benchmarks beyond English to diverse languages and script families to understand cross-lingual transfer and biases embedded in pretraining/fine-tuning data.", "method": "Two settings: data unlearning and concept unlearning.

However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score.

Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $\u03b5> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples.

The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities.

We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer.

Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks.

This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses.

However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner.

Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection.

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoMonitor-Bench \u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b 3,010 \u6761\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3a Miss Rate (MR) \u4e0e False Alarm Rate (FAR)\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8861\u91cf\u6f0f\u68c0\u5931\u6548\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5bf9 12 \u5bb6\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e 10 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 MR \u4e0e FAR \u4e4b\u95f4\u5448\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u4e3a\u63a2\u7a76\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53c8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 153,581 \u6761\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u5bf9 Qwen3-4B-Instruction \u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u5728\u6613\u6784\u9020\u7684\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u51fa\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14 MR \u4e0e FAR \u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03 AutoMonitor-Bench\uff1a\u5305\u542b 3,010 \u6761\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6210\u5bf9\u5730\u5305\u542b\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e benign\uff08\u826f\u6027\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u4ee5 Miss Rate (MR) \u4e0e False Alarm Rate (FAR) \u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u7684\u6f0f\u68c0\u4e0e\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u5bf9 12 \u6b3e\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e 10 \u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6784\u5efa 153,581 \u6761\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03 Qwen3-4B-Instruction\uff0c\u4ee5\u8003\u5bdf\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u4e14\u8f83\u6613\u6784\u9020\u7684\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4e0e\u66f4\u9690\u6027\u7684\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cMR \u548c FAR \u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5f20\u529b\u3002\u4ee5\u6613\u6784\u9020\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u3001\u9690\u6027\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u591a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Romanization in pretraining mLMs yields mixed results: minimal loss for segmental-script languages, degradation for morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese/Japanese) that high-fidelity romanization only partially mitigates; no evidence that increased subword overlap harms cross-lingual transfer; romanization can improve encoding efficiency for segmental scripts with little to no performance cost.", "motivation": "To assess whether romanization is a generally suitable representation for pretraining large multilingual language models, beyond the setup that favors romanization (high-resource Latin-script transfer, close-script relatives).

However, for morphosyllabic scripts, the benefits are limited and losses persist; vocabulary overlap alone does not imply negative cross-lingual interference, suggesting romanization's applicability is language-script dependent and warrants careful script choice in pretraining."}}

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7 clustering \u5c06\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001RSS \u53d8\u52a8\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u697c/\u591a\u5c42\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5ffd\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5c04\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u53ef\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u5c42\u7ea7\u6216\u697c\u5c42\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5f3a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c06\u672a\u89c1\u6307\u7eb9\u5206\u914d\u5230\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7c07\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u5728\u6240\u9009\u7c07\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b50\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ee5\u5efa\u7b51\u5c42\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4f46\u697c\u5c42\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u6240\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u201d\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u89e6\u53d1\u5c31\u80fd\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u624b\u6bb5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\uff1b\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8bc1\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5747\u672a\u627e\u5230\u7b26\u5408\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30SAE\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u8bc1\u4f2a\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b5b\u9009\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\uff081\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173Token\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u3001\uff082\uff09\u7531LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8de820\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u3001\u5c42\u6570\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u89e6\u53d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\uff1b\u5c06\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173token\u6ce8\u5165\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6587\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5f15\u53d159%-94%\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u5bf9\u4f59\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\uff0cLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bc1\u4f2a\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6ee1\u8db3\u771f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6216\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684SAE\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u672c\u8eab\u3002"}}

Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001 psychologically-grounded \u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8d8a\u72f1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e26\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u64cd\u63a7\uff08\u5982 FITD\uff09\u53ef\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u9700\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 Foot-in-the-Door\uff08FITD\uff09\u7b49\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6280\u5de7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u975e\u6cd5\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u76841500\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u5927 LLM \u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\uff08\u5e26\u5386\u53f2\uff09\u4e0e\u5355\u8f6e\uff08\u65e0\u5386\u53f2\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\u3002", "result": "GPT \u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\uff0cASR \u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u7ea632\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bGoogle Gemini 2.5 Flash \u5c55\u73b0\u6781\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u514d\u75ab\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\uff1bAnthropic Claude 3 Haiku \u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u4f46\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u5404\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u53d9\u4e8b\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b89\u5168\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions.

We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa AGDC\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u79bb\u6563-\u8fde\u7eed\u6df7\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 EOS \u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa ContLayNet \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316-baselines\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u5316 token \u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u503c\u57df\uff08\u5982\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7535\u8def\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u91cf\uff1a\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u503c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u503c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a MLP \u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574 EOS token \u7684 logits \u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ContLayNet\uff08334K \u6837\u672c\uff09\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u56fe\u5f62\u5e03\u5c40\u3001SVG\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cAGDC \u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6df7\u5408\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u6563-\u8fde\u7eed\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u6d45\u7684\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e0eQLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Llama 3 8B\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTRM\u5728\u541e\u5410\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30TRM\u5728ARC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u8d21\u732e\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9012\u5f52\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684TRM\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff1a1) 1000\u6837\u672c\u6295\u7968\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u8f6e\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b2) puzzle-id\u6d88\u878d\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b3) \u9012\u5f52\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6709\u6548\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728canonical vs heavy augmentation\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b5) \u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08Llama 3 8B\u7684QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u5728canonical ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u541e\u5410\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5e7f\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c1000\u6837\u672c\u6295\u7968\u6bd4\u5355\u8f6e\u63a8\u65ad\u5728Pass@1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b2) puzzle-id\u6d88\u878d\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7a7a\u767d\u6216\u968f\u673aID\u5bfc\u81f4\u96f6\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u9012\u5f52\u8f68\u8ff9\u663e\u793a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740latent\u66f4\u65b0\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f83\u6d45\uff1b4) \u91cd\u589e\u5e7f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b5) \u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684Llama 3 8B QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTRM\u7684\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u541e\u5410\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u7efc\u5408\u770b\uff0cARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u6e90\u4e8e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5c06\u5176\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u6210\u5206\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases.

In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217 Transformers \u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u76f8\u52a0\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u540e\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff09\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65cf\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u8fd8\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u5e26\u5c40\u90e8\u5377\u79ef\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u878d\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u88ab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u9879\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e token \u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd Transformer \u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ec5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u540c\u4e00 Transformer \u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5212\u5206\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u76f8\u52a0\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u540e\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u77ed\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\uff08AG News\u3001IMDB\u3001ArXiv\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u8fd8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef learnable \u7684\u878d\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u4ee5\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u751a\u5fae\uff1b\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u589e\u76ca\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff1blearnable \u878d\u5408\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65cf\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff1b\u95e8\u63a7/\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u878d\u5408\u662f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217 Transformer \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u975e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5316\u878d\u5408\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6 DSTS\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206 ASD \u4e0e TD\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4fa7\u91cd\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6 DSTS\uff0c\u6574\u5408 Class-aware Representation \u4e0e Imbalance-aware Mechanisms\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u533a\u5206 ASD \u4e0e TD\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDSTS \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u773c\u52a8 ASD \u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 DSTS \u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges.

While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively.

Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts.

The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa IIB-LPO\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u89e6\u53d1\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\u3001\u4ee5\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f35.3%\uff0c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u81f37.4%\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5168\u5c40\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u6613\u88ab\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u957f\uff1b\u5c40\u90e8token\u66f4\u65b0\u53d7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa IIB-LPO\uff1a\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\uff1b\u4ee5\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b5b\u9009\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u5bf9 token \u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u8f83\u524d\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe5.3%\uff0c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe7.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\u7684\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks.

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u8fdb\u884cPAC\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u7b49\uff08SP\uff09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c5e\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff08EPO\uff09oracle\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u88ab\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u5f85\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c5e\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff08EPO\uff09oracle \u7684\u901a\u7528PAC\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u5ba1\u8ba1\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 SP dimension \u4f5c\u4e3a\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u66f4\u65b0\u96c6\u5408\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u91cf\u5ea6\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u5b83\u5ba1\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u9669\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7531 SP dimension \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u5ba1\u8ba1\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7 EPO oracle \u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u89c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u66f4\u65b0\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u660e SP dimension \u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare the performance and interpretability of Prophet with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest, under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor.

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions.

However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \\textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks.

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.
