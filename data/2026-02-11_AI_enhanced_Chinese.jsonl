Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs.

While recent scaling efforts have improved model capacity, they often fail to construct both context-aware and context-independent user intent from the long-term and real-time behavior sequence. Meanwhile, recent work also suffers from inefficient and homogeneous interaction mechanisms, leading to suboptimal prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose HeMix, a scalable ranking model that unifies adaptive sequence tokenization and heterogeneous interaction structure. Specifically, HeMix introduces a Query-Mixed Interest Extraction module that jointly models context-aware and context-independent user interests via dynamic and fixed queries over global and real-time behavior sequences. For interaction, we replace self-attention with the HeteroMixer block, enabling efficient, multi-granularity cross-feature interactions that adopt the multi-head token fusion, heterogeneous interaction and group-aligned reconstruction pipelines. HeMix demonstrates favorable scaling behavior, driven by the HeteroMixer block, where increasing model scale via parameter expansion leads to steady improvements in recommendation accuracy. Experiments on industrial-scale datasets show that HeMix scales effectively and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{SARM}, an end-to-end ranking architecture that integrates natural-language semantic anchors directly into ranking optimization, enabling fine-grained author representations conditioned on multimodal content. Each semantic anchor is represented as learnable text tokens jointly optimized with ranking features, allowing the model to adapt content descriptions to ranking objectives. A lightweight dual-token gated design captures domain-specific live-streaming semantics, while an asymmetric deployment strategy preserves low-latency online training and serving.

To address this limitation, we propose PerPEFT, a personalized PEFT strategy for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, PerPEFT groups users by interest and assigns a distinct PEFT module to each group, enabling each module to capture the fine-grained item aspects most predictive of that group`s purchase decisions. We further introduce a specialized training technique that strengthens this user-group conditioning. Notably, PerPEFT is PEFT-agnostic and can be paired with any PEFT method applicable to multimodal foundation models. Through extensive experiments, we show that (1) PerPEFT outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 15.3% (NDCG@20) and (2) delivers consistent gains across diverse PEFT variants.

To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies.

We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns.

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations.

We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets.

To address these challenges, we propose DiffuReason, a unified \"Think-then-Diffuse\" framework for sequential recommendation. It integrates multi-step Thinking Tokens for latent reasoning, diffusion-based refinement for denoising intermediate representations, and end-to-end Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) alignment to optimize for ranking performance. In the Think stage, the model generates Thinking Tokens that reason over user history to form an initial intent hypothesis. In the Diffuse stage, rather than treating this hypothesis as the final output, we refine it through a diffusion process that models user intent as a probabilistic distribution, providing iterative denoising against reasoning noise. Finally, GRPO-based reinforcement learning enables the reasoning and refinement modules to co-evolve throughout training, without the constraints of staged optimization.

We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available.

However, in the initial retrieval stage, practitioners face an inherent tradeoff between embedding expressiveness and the scalability and latency of serving components, resulting in the need for representations that are both compact and expressive. To address this challenge, we propose a training strategy for learning high-dimensional sparse embedding layers in place of conventional dense ones, balancing efficiency, representational expressiveness, and interpretability. To demonstrate our approach, we modified the production-grade collaborative filtering autoencoder ELSA, achieving up to 10x reduction in embedding size with no loss of recommendation accuracy, and up to 100x reduction with only a 2.5% loss. Moreover, the active embedding dimensions reveal an interpretable inverted-index structure that segments items in a way directly aligned with the model's latent space, thereby enabling integration of segment-level recommendation functionality (e.g., 2D homepage layouts) within the candidate retrieval model itself.

Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels.

To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning.

Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages.

Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software.

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation.

To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS).

Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law.

We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u672a\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u6269\u5c55\u8bcd\u8868\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5411\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b0\u8bcd\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53470.54%\u548c2.60%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u9009\u62e9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u76ca\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6b64\u524d\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u652f\u63f4\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bcd\u8868\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u8868\u793a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u56db\u6b65\uff1a(1)\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u8bcd\u8868\uff1b(2)\u7b5b\u9009\u539f\u59cb\u8bcd\u8868\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\uff1b(3)\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b(4)\u57fa\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u540e\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u53470.54%\uff0c\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u53472.60%\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u672a\u51fa\u73b0\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u667a\u80fd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u8bcd\u8868\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Submitted to ACL 2026", "summary": "Model compression is increasingly essential for deploying large language models (LLMs), yet existing evaluations are limited in method coverage and focus primarily on knowledge-centric benchmarks. Thus, we introduce UniComp, a unified evaluation framework for comparing pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. UniComp evaluates compressed models along three dimensions: performance, reliability, and efficiency, using a diverse set of capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks together with a hardware-aware efficiency analysis. Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniComp\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u572840\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\u4e25\u91cd\uff09\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6027\u80fd-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534750%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e9f\u9700\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u533a\u3002", "method": "UniComp\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3002\u4ece\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u80fd\u529b/\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u591a\u5143\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08>40\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u516d\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(i)\u538b\u7f29\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u7559\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u9000\u5316\uff1b(ii)\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u867d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff1b(iii)\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fbe50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5c40\u9650\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards.

Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks.

By shifting from state-by-state sampling to aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements, BRAIN is resilient to Gaussian noise characteristic of AIMs. We evaluate BRAIN across diverse combinatorial topologies, including the Curie-Weiss and 2D nearest-neighbor Ising systems. We find that under realistic 3\\% Gaussian measurement noise, BRAIN maintains 98\\% ground state fidelity, whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods degrade to 51\\% fidelity.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents.

First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings.

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss.

To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions.

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral).

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach.

To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks.

We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns. In contrast, our gradient residual substantially improves approximation quality.

In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation.

We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning.

This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity.

In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards.

Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors.

Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents.

Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison.

BG-MCTS consistently outperforms budget-agnostic tree-search baselines across different budgets on MATH500 and AIME24/25 with open-weight LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data.

Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality.

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \\geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \\leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification.

In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency.

Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures. These findings highlight the complex relationship between data non-linearities, preprocessing quality, and attribution fidelity, underscoring the vital role of pre-processing techniques in enhancing model interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation.

We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation.

Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules.

Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods.

In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons.

To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design.

Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers.

We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize).

Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems.

Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption.

Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets.

Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN.

We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP).

Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations.

We explore the reverse: crafting training data that induces model behavior. Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models.

The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework.

However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations.

A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.\n  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In contrast to the empirical success of self-improvement, the theoretical foundation of this generative, iterative procedure in a practical, finite-sample setting remains limited. We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks.

We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity.

We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks.

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model.
