An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions, i.e., research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas, and modeling of ideation transitions that capture the logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval, and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, where our approach achieves Recall@30 of 0.329 (16.7% over baselines), our ideation transition retrieval reaches Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment attains 0.37 correlation with expert judgments.

Bridging Sparse and Dense Models", "comment": "25 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs)\uff0c\u4ee5\u573a\u8bba\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u66ff\u4ee3 Transformer/\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u8c31\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e Navier\u2013Stokes \u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57fa\u4e2d\u7684\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u8c31\u6295\u5f71\u53d6\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u7528 Navier\u2013Stokes \u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u573a\u8bba\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a SPDE \u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u8868\u793a\u5e26\u6765\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u7ea6\u675f\u6027\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u60f3\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u58f0\u79f0\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "SGFMs \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u8bba\u3001\u8c31\u57df\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%.

Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted.

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as \"diversity\" or \"debiasing\", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters.

Pilot feasibility study using public-access large language models without API-level orchestration", "summary": "This paper presents a tri-agent cross-validation framework for analyzing stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems. The architecture integrates three heterogeneous LLMs-used for semantic generation, analytical consistency checking, and transparency auditing-into a recursive interaction cycle. This design induces Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS), where intermediate representations are continuously refined through mutually constraining transformations irreducible to single-model behavior. Across 47 controlled trials using public-access LLM deployments (October 2025), we evaluated system stability via four metrics: Reflex Reliability Score (RRS), Transparency Score (TS), Deviation Detection Rate (DDR), and Correction Success Rate (CSR). The system achieved mean RRS = 0.78+-0.06 and maintained TS >= 0.8 in about 68% of trials. Approximately 89% of trials converged, supporting the theoretical prediction that transparency auditing acts as a contraction operator within the composite validation mapping. The contributions are threefold: (1) a structured tri-agent framework for coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs, (2) a formal RKS model grounded in fixed-point theory, and (3) empirical evaluation of inter-model stability under realistic, non-API public-access conditions.

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \\textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \\textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding.

Pan"], "title": "Consistency-Aware Editing for Entity-level Unlearning in Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful information from their training data. Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff08CAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u201c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u201d\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5bf9\u624b\u6027\u6539\u5199\uff09\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728RWKU\u548cToFU\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u7528\u51e0\u5341\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8bb0\u4f4f\u654f\u611f\u3001\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6d88\u9664\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6539\u5199\u7684\u540c\u4e49\u8868\u8ff0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u8f91\uff08CAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u2460 \u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u5173\u4e8e\u8be5\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6539\u5199\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u2461 \u4ee5\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u2462 \u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728RWKU\u4e0eToFU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCAE\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9057\u5fd8/\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u5220\u9664\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4ec5\u82e5\u5e72\uff08\u6570\u5341\uff09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u5220\u9664\u3002", "conclusion": "CAE\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5220\u9664\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ee5\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5feb\u601d\u7ef4/\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(DScheLLM)\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7cbe\u8c03\u7684OpenPangu\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eLoRA\uff0c\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6162\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u683c\u5f0f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u4e3a\u9762\u5bf9\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u662f\u5c06LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5feb\u601d/\u6162\u601d\uff09\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u65e5\u7a0b\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5feb\u3001\u6162\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5bf9Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u51c6 job shop \u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6162\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u88ab\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e14\u683c\u5f0f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c06LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u666e\u9002\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5c06\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

However, real-world information needs often require reasoning about temporal evolution and synthesizing evidence across time periods. We introduce TEMPO, the first benchmark combining temporal reasoning with reasoning-intensive retrieval across 13 domains. TEMPO features: (1) 1,730 complex queries requiring deep temporal reasoning such as tracking changes, identifying trends, or comparing cross-period evidence; (2) step-wise retrieval planning with 3,976 decomposed steps and gold documents mapped to each step for multi-hop evaluation; and (3) novel temporal metrics including Temporal Coverage@k and Temporal Precision@k measuring whether results span required time periods. Evaluation of 12 retrieval systems reveals substantial challenges: the best model (DiVeR) achieves only 32.0 NDCG@10 and 71.4\\% Temporal Coverage@10, demonstrating difficulty in retrieving temporally complete evidence. We believe TEMPO provides a challenging benchmark for improving temporal reasoning in retrieval and RAG systems. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tempo-bench/Tempo.

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e DTW \u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4 DiCE \u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u9891\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e SEP \u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728 SEP \u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 >80% \u7684 DTW \u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u90bb\u6027\uff09\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e DiCE \u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation.

However, existing spatiotemporal retrieval methods are often extensions of conventional vector search systems that rely on external filters or specialized indices to incorporate temporal and spatial constraints, leading to inefficiency, architectural complexity, and limited flexibility in handling heterogeneous modalities. To overcome these challenges, we present a unified spatiotemporal vector retrieval framework that integrates temporal, spatial, and semantic cues within a coherent similarity space while maintaining scalability and adaptability to continuous data streams. Specifically, we propose (1) a Rotary-based Unified Encoding Method that embeds time and location into rotational position vectors for consistent spatiotemporal representation; (2) a Circular Incremental Update Mechanism that supports efficient sliding-window updates without global re-encoding or index reconstruction; and (3) a Weighted Interest-based Retrieval Algorithm that adaptively balances modality weights for context-aware and personalized retrieval. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while maintaining robustness under dynamic data evolution.

It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures.

The scale of this data and its unstructured format still continue to grow requiring ever more robust automated extraction and retrieval mechanisms. Existing work, leveraging the web pages Document Object Model (DOM), often derives clustering vectors from coordinates informed by the DOM such as visual placement or tree structure. The construction and component value of these vectors often go unexamined. Our work proposes and examines DOM coordinates in a detail to understand their impact on web page segmentation. Our work finds that there is no one-size-fits-all vector, and that visual coordinates under-perform compared to DOM coordinates by about 20-30% on average. This challenges the necessity of including visual coordinates in clustering vectors. Further, our work finds that simple vectors, comprised of single coordinates, fare better than complex vectors constituting 68.2% of the top performing vectors of the pages examined.

However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \\textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains.

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa OpenDecoder\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30 retrieved \u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6570\u3001\u6392\u540d\u5206\u6570\u3001QPP \u5206\u6570\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a RAG\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u5d4c\u5165\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u603b\u662f\u76f8\u5173\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7eb3\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa OpenDecoder\uff0c\u5c06\u4e09\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u6392\u540d\u548c QPP \u5206\u6570\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u89e3\u7801\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e0e LLM \u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u6807\u8054\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cOpenDecoder \u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8 RAG \u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6574\u5408\u4efb\u610f\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u663e\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728 RAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors.

We present RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating), both a benchmark and a replicable methodology based on paradigm inversion - generating documents from known ground truth rather than extracting ground truth from documents. This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIKER \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e paradigm inversion \u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 ground truth \u751f\u6210\u6587\u6863\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bc4\u5206\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u514d\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u5177\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bc4\u6d4b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u9898\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6613\u6c61\u67d3\u3001LLM \u8bc4\u6d4b\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3001ground truth \u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 paradigm inversion\uff1a\u7528\u5df2\u77e5 ground truth \u751f\u6210\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6 ground truth\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u8bed\u6599\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u6216\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9 33 \u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8d85\u8fc7 2100 \u4ebf\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5ba3\u79f0\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e38\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea6 32K \u4ee4\u724c\u540e\u663e\u8457\u52a3\u5316\uff1b\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u805a\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5355\u6587\u6863\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b grounding \u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6297\u5e7b\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5206\u79bb\u7684\uff0c\u64c5\u957f\u627e\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f1a\u907f\u514d\u634f\u9020\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 ground truth \u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6587\u6863\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function.

We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time.

Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment.

Unlike conventional systems that provide generic suggestions, PediaMind-R1 draws on insights from developmental psychology. It introduces temperament theory from the Thomas-Chess framework and builds a temperament knowledge graph for infants and toddlers (0-3 years). Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments.

However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive \"correct\" or \"incorrect\") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness). These findings show that answer matching is generally robust to inexpensive text manipulation and is a viable alternative to traditional LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation when reference answers are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b54\u6848\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u8f83\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9009\u9879\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u5bf9\u6297\u731c\u6d4b\u3001\u5570\u55e6\u7b49\u64cd\u7eb5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8003\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5197\u957f\u56de\u7b54\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u91cd\u7b54\u6848\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u524d\u540e\u5d4c\u5165\u51b2\u7a81\u7b54\u6848\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0a\u8ff0\u64cd\u7eb5\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5e38\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b54\u6848\u5339\u914d\u603b\u4f53\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u6587\u672c\u64cd\u63a7\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": " RISER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e72\u9884\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u3001\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730 steering \u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5.", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u5e93\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6309\u8f93\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u8def\u7531\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u8bed\u7684\u7ec4\u5408", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cRISER\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b03.4-6.5%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u96f6-shot\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728Token\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8aCoT\u98ce\u683c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62-3\u500d\uff1b\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0cRISER\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\u7ec4\u5408\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565", "conclusion": "RISER\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9010\u6811\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u63a8\u6f14\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5SRT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6f14\u89e3\u7801\uff08speculative decoding\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea62.08x\u7684\u5899\u949f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u5230PPO\u3001GRPO\u3001DAPO\u7b49\u6807\u51c6RL\u7ba1\u7ebf\u53ca\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684on-policy RL\u4e2d\uff0crollout\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6587\u672c\u3002\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u8be5\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u6848\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6f14\u89e3\u7801\uff08draft model\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u4ece\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684rollout\u66f4\u65b0\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GPU\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u6267\u884crun-ahead\u63a8\u6f14\u3002\u5c06SRT\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u51c6RL\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff08\u5982PPO\u3001GRPO\u3001DAPO\uff09\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6b65\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6bcftoken\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728 rollout \u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\u7ea62.08x\u7684\u5899\u949f\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "SRT\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684on-policy RL\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u6f14\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709RL\u7ba1\u7ebf\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates.

Code, model, and benchmark publicly released", "summary": "Automated news verification requires structured claim extraction, but existing approaches either lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains. This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points.

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts.

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels.

However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine.

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\\% and 98\\%.

First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency.

Corresponding author: Yan Lin", "summary": "Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training.

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes.

We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5bf9\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5 KTCF\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6559\u5b66\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u80b2\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65bd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa KTCF\uff1a\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6982\u5ff5\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5bf9\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\u6559\u80b2\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a 5.7%\u201334%\u3002", "result": "KTCF \u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6307\u4ee4\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1f\u62c5\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6df1\u5316\u3002"}}

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\uff1b Omni-R1 \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5 SFT+RL \u6846\u67b6\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c Omni-R1-Zero \u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u4e3e\u9010\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u505a\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6cbf\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u8c61\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a Omni-R1\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SFT+RL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca Omni-R1-Zero\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u4e3e\u51fa\u9010\u6b65\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOmni-R1 \u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1bOmni-R1-Zero \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7 Omni-R1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6491\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u4e3e\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule.

Functional Analysis and Transferability of Generalization Circuits in Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the \"curse of two-hop reasoning\" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a \"Generalization Circuit\" during a prolonged \"grokking\" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the \"Generalization Circuit\" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that \"grokked\" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "Grokking in parameter-sharing transformers forms a Generalization Circuit, but this circuit does not equate to a new reasoning paradigm; transferability remains limited and high unseen accuracy can arise independently of grokking under certain data regimes.", "motivation": "Investigate whether grokked models outperform non-grokked ones on downstream tasks and whether the computational cost of grokking is justified, by mechanistically examining the Generalization Circuit and knowledge integration.", "method": "Empirical/mechanistic analysis comparing inference paths of grokked vs non-grokked models on in-distribution compositional queries, testing their ability to transfer when integrating new knowledge, and exploring the relationship between prolonged training, memory integration, and generalization to unseen cases.", "result": "(i) Inference paths for grokked and non-grokked models on in-distribution queries are identical, suggesting grokking does not signal a new reasoning paradigm but integrates memorized atomic facts into existing paths.

Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.\n  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes.

A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher.

While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem.

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines.

A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "BalDRO \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0a\u754c\uff08min-sup\uff09\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7684\u6837\u672c\u653e\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b BalDRO-G\uff08\u79bb\u6563 GroupDRO \u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\u4e0e BalDRO-DV\uff08\u8fde\u7eed Donsker-Varadhan \u5bf9\u5076\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u6b65\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u77e5\u8bc6\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5747\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5185\u6b65\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u96be\u4ee5\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6700\u574f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5916\u6b65\u5728\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1aBalDRO-G \u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563 GroupDRO\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u5b50\u96c6\uff1bBalDRO-DV \u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u7684 Donsker-Varadhan \u5bf9\u5076\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728 TOFU \u4e0e MUSE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBalDRO \u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0cBalDRO \u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002"}}

This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative.

Raju"], "title": "Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\u03c1\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\u03c1= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling.

This model goes beyond Korean text processing by integrating the values, reasoning patterns, and commonsense knowledge inherent to Korean society, enabling nuanced understanding of cultural contexts, emotional subtleties, and real-world scenarios to generate reliable and culturally appropriate responses. To address limitations of existing LLMs, often caused by insufficient or low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, Mi:dm 2.0 emphasizes robust data quality through a comprehensive pipeline that includes proprietary data cleansing, high-quality synthetic data generation, strategic data mixing with curriculum learning, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer to improve efficiency and coverage. To realize this vision, we offer two complementary configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters), built with a depth-up scaling strategy for general-purpose use, and Mi:dm 2.0 Mini (2.3B parameters), optimized for resource-constrained environments and specialized tasks. Mi:dm 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean-specific benchmarks, with top-tier zero-shot results on KMMLU and strong internal evaluation results across language, humanities, and social science tasks. The Mi:dm 2.0 lineup is released under the MIT license to support extensive research and commercial use. By offering accessible and high-performance Korea-centric LLMs, KT aims to accelerate AI adoption across Korean industries, public services, and education, strengthen the Korean AI developer community, and lay the groundwork for the broader vision of K-intelligence.

First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error.

This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u7b7e\u8f6c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u9020\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff1bLLMs\u7684\u5d1b\u8d77\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u586b\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7 schemas\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u53ef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4efd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5951\u5408LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u970d\u514b\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u7684 Hawkes Attention\uff0c\u7528\u6309\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u5236\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u952e\u548c\u503c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u5e8f\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MTPP\uff09\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 Transformer \u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u4e00\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Hawkes Attention\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u970d\u514b\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6309\u7c7b\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8c03\u5236 Query\u3001Key\u3001Value \u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e MTPP \u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728 MTPP \u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Hawkes Attention \u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528 MTPP \u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance.

In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training.

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5R4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u540d\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee(rMSE)\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u8bc4\u5206\u578b\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u6f5c\u5728\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "R4 \u4f7f\u7528rMSE\uff1a\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u89c6\u4e3a\u5e8f\u6570\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6\u4e00\u7ec4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u56de\u62a5\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u89e3\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cR4 \u5728 OpenAI Gym \u4e0e DeepMind Control Suite \u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u8d70/\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u7ea7\u548c\u504f\u597dRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "R4 \u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u5728RL\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5LLM\u4eceESCO\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eESCO\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f0f\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e7f\u544a\u53e5\u5b50\u4e0e\u6280\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5916\u52a0RoBERTa\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0F1@5=0.72\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eTF-IDF\u548c\u6807\u51c6BERT\uff0c\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e7f\u544a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6280\u80fd\u672c\u4f53\uff08\u5982ESCO\uff09\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\uff08XMLC\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e7f\u544a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6b63\u5f0f\u6280\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6216\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\uff081\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4eceESCO\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eESCO Level-2\u7c7b\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f0f\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e7f\u544a\u53e5\u5b50\u4e0eESCO\u6280\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5171\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9BERT\u8fdb\u884cBiLSTM\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u6539\u9020\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u5197\u957f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u9648\u8ff0\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eRoBERTa\u7684\u4e0a\u6e38\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5254\u9664\u975e\u6280\u80fd\u53e5\u5b50\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5728\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\uff1b\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6587\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230F1@5=0.72\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8eTF-IDF\u548c\u6807\u51c6BERT\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e3a\u52b3\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "XLinear \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e MLP \u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40 token \u4e0e\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca sigmoid \u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684 MLP \u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e26\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5916\u751f\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u5355\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u73b0\u6709 Transformer \u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0cPatch \u65b9\u6848\u867d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u8de8\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40 token \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u67a2\u7ebd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528 sigmoid \u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684 MLP \u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u53d8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u751f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u542b\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cXLinear \u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709 SOTA \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53d7\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "XLinear \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u5e26\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u67a2\u7ebd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses.

Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency.

Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $\u0394W = BA^\\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $\u0394W = B\u03a3A^\\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories.

Preprint", "summary": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa EIUR \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u63a7\uff08MTR\uff09\u53ca\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u9a8c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347 epistemic identifiability\uff1b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u6000\u7591\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u6b63\u786e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u4ece\u67d0\u6b21\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u81ea\u6211\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u9519\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316 Monitor-Trust-Regulator(MTR) \u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a slowly varying \u7684\u4f53\u9a8c-\u4fe1\u4efb\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u8f6f\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8150\u8d25\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728 EIUR \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e MTR \u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 epistemic identifiability\uff1b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6000\u7591\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u4e0d\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e epistemic \u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u65e9\u671f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u800c\u88ab\u9501\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u8bca\u65ad\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "MTR \u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5316\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u81ea\u6cbb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction.

When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis.

However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment.

Existing machine learning methods that mine open-ended comments usually reduce feedback to binary sentiment, which overlooks concrete concerns such as content clarity, feedback timeliness, and instructor demeanor, and provides limited guidance for instructional improvement.We propose TeachPro, a multi-label learning framework that systematically assesses five key teaching dimensions: professional expertise, instructional behavior, pedagogical efficacy, classroom experience, and other performance metrics. We first propose a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder, which integrates three core components: (i) a pre-trained text encoder that transforms qualitative feedback annotations into contextualized embeddings; (ii) a prompt module that represents five teaching dimensions as learnable semantic anchors; and (iii) a cross-attention mechanism that aligns evidence with pedagogical dimensions within a structured semantic space. We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations.

Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision.

However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

Preprint", "summary": "Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6 ReGraM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u67e5\u8be2\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u7684 factual accuracy \u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6574 KG \u8981\u4e48\u6267\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u97f3\u9ad8\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63a8\u7406\u51fa\u4e0e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u591a\u8bc1\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u533a\u57df\u6784\u9020\u4e0e\u8df3\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6574\u56fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u533b\u7597 QA \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf KGARevion\uff0cMCQ \u63d0\u5347 8.04% \u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cSAQ \u63d0\u5347 4.50%\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e 42.9%\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u8868\u660e\u533a\u57df\u6784\u9020\u5bf9\u8df3\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u7684 KG \u63a8\u7406\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597 QA \u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days).

However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems.

Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding.

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model.

Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling.

We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation.

Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions.

This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "BabyLMs can serve as effective low-cost proxies for pre-model debiasing, mirroring bias formation and debiasing outcomes of larger LMs, enabling rapid and economical research (\u224830 GPU-hours vs >500).", "motivation": "Democratize pre-model debiasing research by reducing training costs while preserving bias acquisition dynamics observed in larger models; investigate whether compact models can approximate bias formation and responses to debiasing.", "method": "Compare BabyLMs (compact BERT-like models trained on small corpora) with standard BERT models across intrinsic bias formation, learning dynamics, and multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods; perform pre-model debiasing experiments focusing on gender imbalance and toxicity.", "result": "BabyLMs exhibit bias formation and performance trajectories closely aligned with BERT; correlations in bias under various debiasing methods persist; replication of prior findings and new insights on gender imbalance and toxicity; pre-training cost reduced from >500 GPU-hours to <30 GPU-hours.", "conclusion": "BabyLMs serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LM debiasing, enabling faster and cheaper exploration to develop fairer LMs and democratize pre-model debiasing research."}}

However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u5212\u5206\u3001\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u4e0eFOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8c13\u8bcd\u5143\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728NL\u5230FOL\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u6211\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u4e3a\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u4e0eFOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b4) \u589e\u8bbe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u5143\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b5) \u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c13\u8bcd\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u8c13\u8bcd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c0fLM\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578bLM\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u53ef\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape.

Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD) \u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65e0\u75d5\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u6613\u5220\u4e0e\u96be\u5220\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6df1\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u75d5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7531\u6570\u636e\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ea6\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6240\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u8def\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65e0\u75d5\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CUD \u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u65e0\u75d5\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u901a\u8def\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u65e9\u4e2d\u6bb5\u4e0e\u665a\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6613\u5220\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u96be\u5220\u6837\u672c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65e0\u75d5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "CUD \u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u5206\u6613\u5220\u4e0e\u96be\u5220\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u65e0\u75d5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6613\u5220\u6837\u672c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u77ed\u3001\u6d45\u3001\u65e9\u6bb5\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u96be\u5220\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u6df1\u4e14\u9760\u8fd1\u540e\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7b7e\u540d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u75d5\u96be\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6279 principled\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65e0\u75d5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative.

To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework.

Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "MXFP 8 \u4f4d\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\uff0cMXFP 4 \u4f4d\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bPTQ \u5728 MXFP \u4e0b\u53d7\u683c\u5f0f\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1bMXFP4 \u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\uff0c\u524d\u7f29\u653e\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u805a\u7126\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9 Microscale Floating-Point (MXFP) \u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6307\u5357\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u8986\u76d6\u7ea67\u79cd PTQ \u7b97\u6cd5\u300115\u9879\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u30013\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c MXFP \u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u683c\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "MXFP8 \u8fd1\u4f3c\u65e0\u635f\u8868\u73b0\uff1bMXFP4 \u6613\u9020\u6210\u660e\u663e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bPTQ \u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u683c\u5f0f\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u591a\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u666e\u904d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u679c\u5448\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u5927\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1bMXFP4 \u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u524d\u7f6e\u7f29\u653e\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5c06\u73b0\u6709 PTQ \u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230 MXFP \u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u683c\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u5728 MXFP \u4e0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ortho-LoRA uses gradient projection to align multi-task LoRA adapters, reducing negative transfer and recovering most of the multi-task vs single-task gap with minimal overhead.", "motivation": "MTL with LoRA suffers from task interference due to a shared, low-rank adapter; a method is needed to disentangle conflicting gradients within the LoRA subspace.", "method": "A gradient projection approach tailored to LoRA's bipartite structure that projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement within the intrinsic LoRA subspace, preserving task-specific updates while reducing interference.", "result": "Experiments on GLUE show effective mitigation of task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering ~95% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.", "conclusion": "Ortho-LoRA effectively reduces task interference in LoRA-based MTL, enabling efficient, near-parity multi-task performance with minimal extra cost."}}

We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faConGLUDe\uff0c\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5c11\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6-shot\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u53e3\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5019\u9009\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u57fa\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5404\u81ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u914d\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u53e3\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578bConGLUDe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u86cb\u767d\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u914d\u4f53\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u4f4d\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5305\u62ec\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u83b7\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6-shot\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684SOTA\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u8f93\u5165\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u83b7\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5bf9\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "ConGLUDe\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u5168\u5c40\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric \"is-a\" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k.

Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool.

Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation.

We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation.

A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8bcd\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u7f00\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8be5\u5d4c\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f0f Transformer\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer \u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u6570\u503c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7b97\u672f\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u88ab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u8bb0\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u524d\u7f00 token\uff0c\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f0f Transformer \u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u503c\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u503c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u597d\u3002"}}
