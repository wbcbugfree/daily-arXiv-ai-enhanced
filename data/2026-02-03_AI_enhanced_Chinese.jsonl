Yet dominant systems fuse modalities in the spatial domain, obscuring the frequency structure of signals and amplifying misalignment and redundancy. We adopt a spectral information-theoretic view and show that, under an orthogonal transform that approximately block-diagonalizes bandwise covariances, the Gaussian Information Bottleneck objective decouples across frequency bands, providing a principled basis for separate-then-fuse paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands).

With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.\n  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec). First, it estimates the reliability of cached semantics under the user's latest interactions. Second, an on-device semantic calibration module is proposed to adjusts the cached semantic embedding on-device using up-to-date interaction evidence, without per-request cloud LLM involvement.

When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language.

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u54c8\u5e0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u89c6\u89c9/\u542c\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6c49\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BioCLIP/BioLingual\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf/\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u54c8\u5e0c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u54c8\u5e0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001(\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891)\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6c49\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9/\u58f0\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269 foundation \u6a21\u578b\uff08BioCLIP\u3001BioLingual\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u54c8\u5e0c\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08iNaturalist2024\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u3001iNatSounds2024\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6837\u58f0\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\u79fb\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff09", "result": "\u79bb\u6563\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u4e8e\u540e\u8005\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u54c8\u5e0c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u96f6-shot \u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6863\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u96f6-shot\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, current extension strategies are highly diverse and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation based on a radix system conversion perspective, which elegantly unifies various RoPE-extension approaches as distinct radix conversion strategies. Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets.

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa BEAR\uff08Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e beam search \u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u9879\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a token \u5728\u6bcf\u6b65\u90fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u524d B \u540d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u524d\u7f00\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5728 beam search \u4e2d\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u526a\u679d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 SFT \u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u8d2e\u8fdb\u884c\u7684 beam search \u4e2d\u4ecd\u80fd\u88ab\u68c0\u51fa\uff1b\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u524d\u7f00\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u63d0\u524d\u4e22\u5f03\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u653e\u677e\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u6b63\u9879\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00 token \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5019\u9009 token \u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u524d B\uff1b\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee3\u66ff\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u62df beam search \u7684\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cBEAR \u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9 beam search \u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BEAR \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 beam-search \u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559 SFT \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\u540e\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair.

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs' deliberative reasoning enhances rationality and expected-value optimization; emotion steering via ICP and RLS differently distort judgments, revealing a trade-off between controllability and human-aligned behavior.", "motivation": "Assess whether LLMs exhibit core rationality (axioms) and human-like affective biases to inform their use in high-stakes decisions and as models of human behavior.", "method": "Systematic evaluation of multiple LLM families on (i) rational-choice benchmarks testing axioms and (ii) behavioral-economics/social-norm domains with emotion influence.

This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error.

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process.

We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI.

We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8026\u5408\u4e3a\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u6539\u5199\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\uff0c\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5fae\u5c0f\u6539\u52a8\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u6027\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e00\u8d77\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8aLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08MedAlign \u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027/\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u75c7\u4e9a\u578b\u62bd\u53d6\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff08\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u5374\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u6539\u5199\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1/\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u65f6\u4ee5 modest \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6210\u672c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u63a8\u5e7f\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e38\u6a21\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper evaluates both traditional machine-learning (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) and deep-learning techniques including custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, and three transfer-learning models (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) for binary classification of 25 077 waste images (80/20 train/test split, augmented and resized to 150x150 px). The paper assesses the impact of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on traditional models. DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy (91 %) and ROC-AUC (0.98), outperforming the best traditional classifier by 20 pp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed negligible benefit for classical methods, whereas transfer learning substantially improved performance under limited-data conditions. Finally, we outline how these models integrate into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System for automated waste sorting, highlighting potential reductions in landfill use and lifecycle environmental impacts.)", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u572825,077\u5f20\u5e9f\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 DenseNet121 \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387(\u224891%)\u4e0e ROC-AUC(0.98)\u4e0a\u6700\u4f73\uff0cPCA \u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e2e\u52a9\u751a\u5fae\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e9f\u7269\u5206\u62e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u586b\u57cb\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8\u57ce\u5e02\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e9f\u7269\u5206\u62e3\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e9f\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752825,077\u5f20\u5e9f\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c80/20\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u4e00\u7f29\u653e\u81f3150x150\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edfML\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001SVM\u3001AdaBoost\uff09\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u3001VGG16\u3001ResNet50\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bDenseNet121\u3001EfficientNetB0\u3001InceptionV3\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cROC-AUC\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "DenseNet121\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea691%\u548cROC-AUC\u7ea60.98\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u6700\u4f73\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ea620\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bPCA\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e2e\u52a9\u751a\u5fae\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u7b80\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5165\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e9f\u7269\u5206\u62e3\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9014\u5f84\u53ca\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u586b\u57cb\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14DenseNet121\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5e9f\u7269\u5206\u62e3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining \"long tail,\" SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPLA introduces second-order Taylor-based block selection and a residual linear attention (RLA) compressor to handle unselected blocks, achieving efficient long-context attention with competitive accuracy.", "motivation": "address efficiency and fidelity issues in block-wise sparse attention, where discarding unselected blocks leads to contextual loss and IO overhead.", "method": "select relevant blocks using a second-order Taylor expansion-based metric; compress unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via RLA; derive an optimized subtraction-based RLA formulation to compute residual as global minus selected linear attention, avoiding explicit access to unselected blocks during inference.", "result": "empirical results show SPLA closes the continual pretraining performance gap with dense attention and surpasses dense models on long-context benchmarks (e.g., RULER), while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.", "conclusion": "SPLA enables efficient, accurate long-context modeling by combining selective exact attention with a compact residual representation, eliminating IO overhead for unselected blocks."}}

However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps.

Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini.

While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback.

Zhang"], "title": "Tabular Foundation Models Can Do Survival Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u53f3\u622a\u5c3e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5230\u4e8b\u4ef6\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u53f3\u622a\u5c3e\uff1b\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0e\u7f3a\u5931\u6807\u7b7e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u628a\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u770b\u4f5c\u82e5\u5e72\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u622a\u5c3e\u6837\u672c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7f3a\u5931\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60/\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u622a\u5c3e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u751f\u5b58\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u5bf953\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u572853\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u751f\u5b58\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SRLMs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u5355\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5448\u73b0~1/\u221an\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570T\u5448\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5e76\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027Softmax\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u8865\u5bf9SRLMs\u673a\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5355\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b8c\u6574\u8fed\u4ee3\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5~\u014c(1/\u221an)\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570T\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5e76\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u5230\u7ebf\u6027Softmax\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u7c7b\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5355\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u660e\u786e\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4ee5~\u014c(1/\u221an)\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u968fT\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027Softmax\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u6d1e\u89c1\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aSRLMs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e76\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth.

To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities.

While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Darwinian Memory System (DMS)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 GUI \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 MLLMs \u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d MLLM \u5728 GUI \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u9648\u65e7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5efa\u6a21\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u751f\u5b58\u6cd5\u5219\uff1b\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5355\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u751f\u5b58\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u526a\u9664\u6b21\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cDMS \u4f7f\u901a\u7528 MLLMs \u5728\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347 18.0%\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347 33.9%\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "DMS \u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u9762\u5411 GUI \u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u901a\u7528 MLLMs \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability.

While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that SurrogateSHAP effectively localizes data sources responsible for spurious correlations in clinical images, providing a scalable path toward auditing safety-critical generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SurrogateSHAP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3cShapley\u503c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u9700\u8017\u8d39\u6781\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff08CIFAR-20\u4e0aDDPM-CFG\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001Post-Impressionist\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u3001Fashion-Product\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f15\u53d1\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u6b63\u8865\u507f\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u624e\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\u3002Shapley\u503c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff08\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e14\u5b50\u96c6\u6570\u91cf\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u843d\u5730\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Shapley\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSurrogateSHAP\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfcShapley\u503c\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSurrogateSHAP\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6548\u7528\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff1b\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e34\u5e8a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6e90\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "SurrogateSHAP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8865\u507f\u548c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff1b\u5176\u65e0\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5f0fShapley\u503c\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f52\u56e0\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002"}}

Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies.

Dixon"], "title": "Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization", "comment": "22 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold.

To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions.

ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data.

We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection.

While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa PMPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u7edf\u4e00 GRPO/GMPO\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684 Clip-aware ESS \u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u518d\u52a0\u6743\u4e0e\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e0e\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e4b\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a baselines\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5ffd\u89c6\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u7684\u5e42\u6307\u6570\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u5e42\u6307\u6570 p\uff0cGRPO/GMPO \u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Clip-aware ESS\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u88c1\u526a\u5206\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76ee\u6807 ESS \u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6c42\u89e3\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b9e\u9645 ESS \u4e0e\u76ee\u6807 ESS \u5bf9\u9f50\u7684 p\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4ece Arithmetic Mean \u5207\u6362\u5230 Geometric Mean\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPMPO \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "PMPO \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($\u03c1$) of end-of-sequence ($\\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\\textbf{$\u03c1$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\\textbf{$\u03c1$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion.

However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u606f\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u76ee\u6807\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5728\u751f\u6210\u521d\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1HOLO\u63d2\u4ef6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u53d7\u9650\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cHOLO\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d77\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9eHolographic Characteristic\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1HOLO\u63d2\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6b65\u6570\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u884c\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d7\u9650\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cHOLO\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u606f\u7279\u5f81\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0cHOLO\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u6587\u672c\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions.

In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u88ab\u5355\u6b21\u65e0\u5bb3\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8de8\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u8bda\u5b9e\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u6e29\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u53d8\u5f97\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u53bb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u547c\u5401\u53d1\u5c55\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u88ab\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u5fd8\u8bb0\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u663e\u73b0\u88ab\u5e94\u5f53\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u9759\u6001\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u533a\u5206\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u66f4\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u969c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u7bb1\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u88ab\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u8bda\u5b9e\u7b49\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u57df\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u65e0\u5bb3\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u7bb1\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u540e\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u6e29\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u663e\u8457\u5931\u53bb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e14\u8d8a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u6613\u9690\u85cf\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u9762\u5411\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u66f4\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa UCPO \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5143\u4f18\u52bf\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6807\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 GRPO\uff09\u56e0\u4e8c\u5143\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9759\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u4f18\u52bf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5143\u4f18\u52bf\u89e3\u8026\uff08Ternary Advantage Decoupling\uff09\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u96be\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cUCPO \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UCPO \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty.

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data.

We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation.

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix.

These results suggest a new paradigm of inference-time scaling for robust reasoning, demonstrating that supervised learning on complete tree-structured traces provides an efficient alternative for developing systematic exploration capabilities in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\u7f16\u7801\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u6761\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6811\uff08\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5916\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6cbf\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6761\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u7f16\u7801\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u6761\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u641c\u7d22\u6811\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u5373\u53ef\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool.

The observed discrepancies are systematically attributable to task characteristics: natural language continuation benefits from likelihood scoring, whereas explicit comparison is better suited to symbol-based selection. These trends are consistent across various decoder-based LLMs, indicating model-agnostic effects. To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals. In contrast to human-designed heuristics, which often degrade performance, this approach uses model-generated signals to determine the optimal format for each problem instance. The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5f0f\u4e0e Cloze \u5f0f\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6-shot\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9LLMs\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5bf9\u683c\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b26\u53f7\u5f0f\u4e0e Cloze \u5f0f\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u9053\u9898\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\uff1b\u5728\u96f6-shot\u4e0b\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u578bLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6-shot\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u578bLLM\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u66f4\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints.

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

To address this research gap, we introduce a novel task APPELLATE REVIEW, aiming to assess models' diagnostic reasoning and reliability in legal practice.

Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff1aLLM\u5904\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u5bc6\u5ea6\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u540c\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u7f55\u89c1\u8bcd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u88c1\u526a\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u975e\u5747\u5300\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u91cf\u5316LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u9891\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e09\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u666e\u904d\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2) \u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff1b3) \u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u8bcd\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u7f55\u89c1\u8bcd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f80\u5f80\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u5bf9LLM\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u88c1\u526a\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "BALANS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eCell Painting\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Cell Painting\u7b49\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3001\u4eea\u5668\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4fee\u6b63\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "BALANS\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635A \u2208 R^(n\u00d7n)\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6837\u672ci\u548cj\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528j\u6240\u5728\u6279\u6b21\u4e2d\u8ddd\u79bbi\u7684\u7b2ck\u8fd1\u90bb\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6279\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u8ba1\u7b97A_{ij}\u3002\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u5f62\u6210\u5168\u90e8n^2\u9879\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff1a\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u7d2f\u8ba1\u90bb\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6bcf\u884c\u7684\u6700\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5f97\u5230A\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u8be5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u7684\u9636\u6b21\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9eCell Painting\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cBALANS\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fee\u6b63\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5e38\u7528\u6279\u6b21\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u539f\u751f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "BALANS\u4ee5\u5c40\u90e8\u6279\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5185\u5bb9\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002"}}

Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability.

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD.

This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender. As the first corpus designed in accordance with the recently introduced taxonomy, we expect our study to pave the way for subsequent enrichment efforts of existing error-annotated learner corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u5206\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 Turkish Learner Corpus\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9762\u5411\u5206\u9762\u7684\u9ad8\u7c92\u5ea6\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u523093\u201396%\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u9762\u7ea7\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6807\u7b7e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u59a8\u788d\u6df1\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u9762 taxonomy\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6ce8\u91ca\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u5e73\u9762\u6ce8\u91ca\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u91ca\u6269\u5145\uff0c\u76ee\u6807 Turkish Learner Corpus\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u9762\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230 95.86%\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u6309\u8be5\u5206\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684 Turkish Learner Corpus\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u624b\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u6307\u5357\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u548c\u6ce8\u91ca\u6269\u5c55\u5668\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u63a8\u52a8\u73b0\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bcc\u5316\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u79cd\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002"}}

Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions.

In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process.

Despite T\u00fcrkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature.

We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions.

Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment.

Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models.

We also construct \\dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \\method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Fraser"], "title": "MixQuant: Pushing the Limits of Block Rotations in Post-Training Quantization", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have adopted block rotations to diffuse outliers prior to rounding. While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5757Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\uff1a\u51fa\u754c\u503c\u6291\u5236\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u82e5\u5206\u5757\u524d\u7684l1\u8303\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5757\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5219\u51fa\u754c\u503c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faMixQuant\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684 mass diffusion \u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u7f6e\u6362\u7b49\u4ef7\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMixQuant\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u90fd\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u5c06Llama3 1B\u91cf\u5316\u4e3aINT4\u3001\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a16\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u768490%\u56de\u6536\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u7f6e\u6362\u65f6\u4ec5\u4e3a46%\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff08PTQ\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9outlier\u6291\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u672a\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u65cb\u8f6c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9outlier\u7684\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5757Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660eoutlier\u6291\u5236\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMixQuant\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b mass\u8fdb\u884c\u7f6e\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5757\u95f4\u8d28\u91cf\u518d\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5757\u5185l1\u8303\u6570\u671f\u671b\u503c\u5c3d\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9610\u660e\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51fa\u754c\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757l1\u8303\u6570\u5747\u8861\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51fa\u754c\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eMixQuant\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728Llama3 1B \u2192 INT4\uff08\u5757\u5927\u5c0f16\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f6e\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u56de\u6536\u8fd190%\u7684\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e4b\u4e0b\u65e0\u7f6e\u6362\u4ec5\u56de\u6536\u7ea646%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5757\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u5230\u7f6e\u6362\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9outlier\u6291\u5236\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347PTQ\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted.

As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\u03c3^2\u03b3^{-2}\\log(Nd/\u03b4)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters.

Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning.

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation.

Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors.

However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a \"remasking\" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Residual Context Diffusion (RCD) \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u88ab remask \u6389\u7684 token \u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u91cd\u7528 discarded token \u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5757\u5f0f dLLMs \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53ef\u5c06\u6807\u51c6 dLLM \u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a RCD \u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea6 10 \u4ebf tokens \u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97 5\u201310 \u70b9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728 AIME \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u6570\u51cf\u5c11 4\u20135 \u500d\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5757\u7ea7 Diffusion LLMs \u91c7\u7528 remasking \u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684 token\uff0c\u5176\u4f59 token \u88ab\u820d\u5f03\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002 discarded token \u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u82e5\u80fd\u590d\u7528\u5219\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7eed\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Residual Context Diffusion (RCD) \u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u88ab\u820d\u5f03 token \u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u56de\u53bb\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u63a8\u7406\uff08SDAR\uff09\u4e0e\u77ed\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\uff08LLaDA\uff09\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6 10 \u4ebf token \u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u6807\u51c6 dLLM \u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a RCD \u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "RCD \u5728\u524d\u6cbf dLLMs \u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347 5\u201310 \u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684 AIME \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6 4\u20135 \u500d\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "RCD \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528 discarded token \u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7eed\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5c06\u73b0\u6709 dLLMs \u8fc1\u79fb\u5230 RCD \u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u65e0\u5e8f/\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\uff1b\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u6839\u672c\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u957f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6781\u5177\u80fd\u529b\u7684AI\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4f1a\u5982\u4f55\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u6307\u5f15\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6765\u81ea\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u6027\u9020\u6210\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4efd\u989d\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406/\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\u957f\u4e0e\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406/\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65e0\u5e8f\uff1b\u4ec5\u9760\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96be\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u66f4\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u672a\u6765AI\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u4f34\u968f\u65e0\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u8ffd\u6c42\u9519\u914d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5956\u8d4f\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5316\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u53d1\u751f\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \\textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201coutlier-driven rescaling\u201d\uff1a\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529bsink\uff09\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u7ef4\u5ea6sink\uff09\u4e0e\u8f6fmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cRMSNorm\u7b49\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ed6\u975eoutlier\u5206\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5316\uff1boutliers\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5438\u6536\u6216\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d emergent outliers \u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00 sink \u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5b58\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b/\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf outliers \u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff08softmax attention\u3001RMSNorm\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a\u3001\u5c06 outliers \u5438\u6536\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aoutliers \u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1b\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f1a\u6d88\u9664 outliers \u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u88c1\u526a outliers \u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002outliers \u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u65b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\u5c0f\u4e8e\u975e outliers\uff1boutliers \u53ef\u88ab\u5438\u6536\u8fdb\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 2 \u70b9\uff09\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08W4A4 \u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea6 1.2 \u70b9\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 outlier-driven rescaling \u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86 sink \u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9 outliers \u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5438\u6536\u6216\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextMATH \u5c06 AIME/MATH-500 \u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u90e8\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u9898\u89e3\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u63cf\u8ff0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u8868\u8ff0\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8054\u52a8\u4e0e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 AIME \u4e0e MATH-500 \u7684\u9898\u76ee\u6539\u9020\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1aScenario Grounding\uff08SG\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u73b0\u5b9e\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f46\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e Complexity Scaling\uff08CS\uff0c\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u51fa\u73b0\u573a\u666f\uff09\u3002\u5bf9 61 \u4e2a\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u505a\u9519\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03 vs \u4ec5\u8868\u8ff0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728 SG \u4e0e CS \u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d 13 \u4e0e 34 \u5206\uff0c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u964d 13 \u4e0e 20 \u5206\uff1b\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9898\u76ee\u8868\u8ff0/\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u968f\u539f\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8ff0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u5171\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u201c\u4ec5\u8868\u8ff0\u8bad\u7ec3\u201d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e24\u8005\u5e76\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u72ec\u6539\u5584\u5176\u4e2d\u4efb\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack.

However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence. Experiments demonstrate substantial bias reduction along both economic and social axes with minimal degradation in response quality. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing ideological neutrality with linguistic and cultural diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6 CLAS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 50 \u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u300133 \u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u7ef4\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS)\uff0c\u5c06\u653f\u6cbb\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9632\u8fc7\u5ea6\u77eb\u6b63\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u663e\u793a\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00 LLM \u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT.

Existing data selection methods suffer from severe domain specificity: techniques optimized for general instruction-following fail on reasoning tasks, and vice versa. We observe that measuring entropy differences between base models and minimally instruction-tuned calibrated models reveals a pattern -- samples with the lowest differential entropy consistently yield optimal performance across domains, yet this principle manifests domain-adaptively: reasoning tasks favor entropy increase (cognitive expansion), while general tasks favor entropy decrease (cognitive compression). We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking.

However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning.

To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency.

Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7ec6\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u5177\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u503e\u5411\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u9519\u914d\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u9020\u6210\u7684\u9519\u914d\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b8c\u597d\uff1b\u9519\u914d\u6e90\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u5f62\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4eba\u8bbe\u6a21\u4eff\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u5bf9\u9f50\u98ce\u9669\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u800c\u975e\u5355\u70b9\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u628a emergent misalignment \u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef/\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u63ed\u793a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8de8\u591a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u503e\u5411\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4eba\u8bbe\u5bf9\u9519\u914d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0e\u540e\u95e8\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u503e\u5411\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u914d\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5f97\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\uff1b\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684Persona prompts\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u663e\u793a emergent misalignment\u3001\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u6613\u611f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b57\u7b26\u5f62\u6210\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e14\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u5065\u58ee\u5bf9\u9f50\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u7ea0\u9519/\u63d0\u793a\u9632\u5fa1\u3002"}}

Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting. This work encourages further efforts to develop cognitively inspired defenses to improve LLM robustness against forms of harm and deception that exploit legal artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF) \u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b66\u8005\u7684 epistemic vigilance\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9047\u5230\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u62d2\u7edd\u5408\u89c4\u5e76\u56de\u9000\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5bf9HIPAA\u548cGDPR\u7b49\u5168\u7403\u6027\u6cd5\u5f8b\u653f\u7b56\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDeepSeek-R1 \u5728\u67d0\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230100%\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u4ee5\u8ba4\u77e5\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9075\u5b88\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bef\u5bfc\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u88ab\u6270\u52a8\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae DEF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u4e00\u53e5\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u62d2\u7edd\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9047\u5230\u6270\u52a8\u578b\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u56de\u9000\u5230\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u4ee5 HIPAA\u3001GDPR \u7b49\u5168\u7403\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbf LLMs \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDeepSeek-R1 \u5728\u67d0\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0 100% \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002", "result": "DEF \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u88ab\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728 DeepSeek-R1 \u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff08100%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u9632\u5fa1\u539f\u5219\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIREN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u56e0\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6574\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u6cbf\u4ece\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u5230\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u865a\u5047\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u7b49Shapley\u516c\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u6761\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u6d3e\u751f\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u516c\u7406\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53ca\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u56e0\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u8d21\u732e\u6cbf\u7740\u4ece\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e95\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u5bfc\u81ea\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u865a\u529f\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u7b49Shapley\u516c\u7406\u7684\u4e09\u6761\u3002\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSIREN\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSIREN\u5728\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SIREN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6574\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08.

In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(n\u03b5)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes.

Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination.

Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL).

In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a \"structure-to-detail\" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u7b56\u7565 FourierSampler\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\u63a7\u5236\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u63a7\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u7ed3\u6784\u5230\u7ec6\u8282\u201d\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 dLLMs \u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u504f\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u610f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 dLLMs \u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u63d0\u51fa FourierSampler\uff0c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u9010\u6b65\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728 LLADA \u4e0e SDAR \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u63a8\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5728 LLaDA1.5-8B \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347 20.4%\uff0c\u5728 LLaDA-8B-Instruct \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 16.0% \u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5982 Llama3.1-8B-Instruct\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u57df\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u2013\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u610f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty.

We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem.

The dataset comprises 581 QA pairs across 105 synthetic r\u00e9sum\u00e9-job description pairs in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese), with questions spanning three complexity levels from basic factual extraction to complex cross-document reasoning. We propose a data generation pipeline derived from real-world sources through de-identification and data synthesis to ensure both realism and privacy, while controlled demographic and professional attributes (implemented via placeholders) enable systematic bias and fairness studies. We also present a cost-effective, human-in-the-loop translation pipeline based on the TEaR methodology, incorporating MQM error annotations and selective post-editing to ensure an high-quality multi-way parallel benchmark.

While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes.

Smith"], "title": "Are you going to finish that? A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and \"word\" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is \"backed-off\" to be token-aligned.

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal.

Current interpretation methods infer feature semantics from activation patterns, but overlook that features are trained to reconstruct activations that serve computational roles in the forward pass. We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits.

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics.

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process.

However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters.

Existing detection methods, typically relying on superficial textual heuristics like self-correction tokens, often fail to capture the model's unvoiced internal conflicts. To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states.

Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness.

However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.\n  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework.

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection.

In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift.

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning.

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06UAV-VLC \u878d\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408 pheromone \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08TD3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f7f\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u81f335%\uff0c\u65b0\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728UAV\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\uff08VLC\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u59ff\u6001\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7167\u660e\u3002\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5148\u5728\u7279\u5b9aVLC\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684 pheromone \u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0eTwin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\uff08TD3 \u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684UAV\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u6240\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u5c06\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a35%\uff1b\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u6570\u7ea6\u7f29\u77ed50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 UAV \u8f85\u52a9 VLC \u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SCOPE-PD\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca AI \u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 SHAP \u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230 98.66% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) \u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cd ML \u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c SHAP \u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a 98.66%\uff1b\u5728 MDS-UPDRS \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u98a4\u6296\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdf\u7f13\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u4e3a\u5bf9 PD \u9884\u6d4b\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u7684\u524d\u4e09\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca AI \u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7684 PD \u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency.

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u7b80\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4e00\u4e2a rollout\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6280\u5de7\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f32\uff1b\u5c06\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 bandit \u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u8fde\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u6b64\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5982\u4f18\u52bf\u3001\u56de\u5408\u6570\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e24\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4f17\u591a\u4e14\u76f8\u4e92\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u65f6\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a principled \u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u624d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u7b80\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e00\u4e2a rollout\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u52bf\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u6279\u91cf32\uff1b\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5e94\u6295\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models.

In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments.

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lethe \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u663e\u73b0\uff08federated unlearning\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f85\u53bb\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5f85\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u62b9\u9664\u3002\u5176 Arrange\u2014Rectify\u2014Restore\uff08Reshape-Rectify-Restore\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6765\u653e\u5927\u5f85\u53bb\u9664\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6d41\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u6062\u590d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u5747\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u540e\u518d\u663e\u73b0\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u53bb\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u5b9a\u53bb\u77e5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u5df2\u53bb\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u663e\u73b0\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u62b9\u9664\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u518d\u663e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "Lethe \u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f Reshape-Rectify-Restore \u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u5f85\u53bb\u9664\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u653e\u5927\u540e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e34\u65f6\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2) \u5c06\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u4e24\u6761\u6d41\u7684\u5206\u6d41\u77eb\u6b63\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f85\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f85\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u675f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5f85\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6301\u4e45 erasure\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a Lethe \u80fd\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6837\u672c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53bb\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u540e\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u6301\u4e45\u6027\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u663e\u73b0\u7387\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "conclusion": "Lethe \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u53bb\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5f85\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u62b9\u9664\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While various methods have been proposed to improve resilience to such overspecification by modifying the optimization procedure, fundamental architectural innovations to this end remain underexplored. In this work, we illustrate that the consensus mechanism, a drop-in replacement for attention, stabilizes transformer training across a wider effective range of learning rates. We formulate consensus as a graphical model and provide extensive empirical analysis demonstrating improved stability across learning rate sweeps on text, DNA, and protein modalities. We further propose a hybrid consensus-attention framework that preserves performance while improving stability.

Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization.

The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods.

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ece\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u89c6\u89d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u68c0\u89c6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u5316\u89e3\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6539\u5199\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5927\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u975e\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity.

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7f29\u653eLoRDS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0e\u5757\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u540c\u6837\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u6bd4\u5757\u7ea7\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7S=BA\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7f29\u653e\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5757\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u727a\u7272\u8868\u793a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f62\u5f0fS=BA\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5757\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\uff1a1) \u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fPTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316 refine\uff1b2) \u6743\u91cd\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u8054\u5408QAT\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9884\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u79e9\u7684PEFT\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f18\u5316\u7684Triton\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4ee5Llama3-8B\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u57283\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u6bd4NormalFloat\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe27.0%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728RTX 4090\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.5x\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u57284\u6bd4\u7279\u7684QLoRA\u4e0a\u63d0\u53479.6%\u7684PEFT\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9002\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u5757\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u548cPEFT\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaDrug: a two-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework for patient cold-start in medication recommendation; combines self-adaptation and peer-adaptation with uncertainty-based filtering; superior performance on MIMIC-III and AKI datasets.", "motivation": "Address patient-level cold-start in EHR-based medication recommendation.

In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects.

In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

A Principled Analysis of Softmax-family Loss", "comment": "34 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance.

Generalizing the geometric intuition of linear kernels to the high-dimensional latent space of LLMs, we formally define the ``Obfuscated Semantic Null Space'', a high-dimensional regime that preserves semantic fidelity while enforcing near-orthogonality to the original embedding. By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing.

However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation.

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63ed\u793a Epanechnikov\u3001biweight\u3001triweight \u7b49\u6838\u5bf9\u5e94 \u03b1-entmax \u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1bsoftmax/Gaussian \u4e3a\u6781\u9650\uff1bMemory Mosaics \u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u5408\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9 top-k \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u56fa\u5b9a/\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684 ReLU \u4e0e sparsemax \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u81ea Epanechnikov \u6838\u56de\u5f52\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e00\u822c\u5316\uff0c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684 Epanechnikov\u3001biweight\u3001triweight \u7b49\u6838\u5bf9\u5e94 \u03b1-entmax\uff0c\u03b1=1+1/n\uff1bsoftmax/Gaussian \u5bf9\u5e94 n\u2192\u221e \u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4ece\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53 Memory Mosaics\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7 critic \u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6 PAVE \u5b9e\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u52a8 actor \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u7aef\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ec5\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u6cbb\u6807\u4e0d\u6cbb\u672c\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u53d7 critic \u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a critic \u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 actor-critic \u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u88ab Q \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u504f\u5bfc\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\uff08\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fa8\u522b\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u6240\u754c\u5b9a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa PAVE\uff1a\u628a critic \u89c6\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316 Q-gradient \u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b\u4e0d\u5bf9 actor \u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e PAVE \u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7aef\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5 critic \u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u6ed1\u8def\u5f84\uff0cPAVE \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539 actor \u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance.

However, most existing methods commit to a single constraint family: weighted behavior cloning, density regularization, or support constraints, without a unified principle that explains their connections or trade-offs. In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection.

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining.

However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound.

By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \\textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\u03b5)$.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ExplainerPFN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6-shot \u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e Shapley \u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e SHAP \u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8e\u9700\u89812-10 SHAP\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5c11-shot \u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684Shapley\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e TabPFN \u67b6\u6784\u7684 ExplainerPFN\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5207\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684 Shapley \u503c\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6-shot \u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8868\u660e ExplainerPFN \u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1 SHAP \u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u4e24\u6761\u53c2\u8003\u89c2\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u96f6-shot \u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684 Shapley \u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u4e0e\u5229\u7528 2-10 \u4e2a SHAP \u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c11-shot \u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u96f6-shot Shapley \u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization.

However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling.

We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF.

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Regularisation in neural networks is not universally beneficial; its effectiveness is dataset-dependent.

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Matterhorn\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408M-TTFS\u7f16\u7801\u548c memristive synapse unit\u7684\u5c16\u5cf0\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u5185\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6743\u91cd\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GLUE\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SNN\u80fd\u8017\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7d2f\u52a0\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u642c\u8fd0\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14SNN\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM-TTFS\u7f16\u7801\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u853d\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u96f6\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u9759\u9ed8\u72b6\u6001(\u51680\u7684 spike \u5e8f\u5217)\u91cd\u65b0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c0fspike\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u8017\uff1b\u5f15\u5165dead zone\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u6bb5\u6570\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9759\u9ed8\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u5c42\u9762\uff0cMSU\u4f7f\u7528 Compute-in-Memory\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6743\u91cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMatterhorn\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SNN\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53471.42%\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u53472.31\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728LLM\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SNN\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data.

We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u5e76\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u75d5\u8ff9\u56de\u6ce8\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u75d5\u8ff9\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7ea0\u9519\u4f46\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u9519\u8bef\u4ecd\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u4e2d\u95f4\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u957f\u5ea6/\u98ce\u683c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u6b65\u534f\u8bae\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\uff1b2) \u6309\u56fa\u5b9a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u622a\u65ad\u75d5\u8ff9\uff1b3) \u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u75d5\u8ff9\u56de\u6ce8\u7ed9\u540c\u4e00\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7531\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u8f93\u51fa\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B\u3001gpt-oss-20b/-120b\uff0c\u5728 GPQA Diamond \u4e0e MMLU-Pro \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63a8\u7406 token \u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u75d5\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u7b49\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u66f4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u75d5\u8ff9\u4e2d\u56de\u6eaf\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u59cb\u9519\u8bef\u4ecd\u53ef\u4f7f\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u504f\u5411\u9519\u8bef\u9009\u9879\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8ff9\u7ebf\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u95f4 token \u662f\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Despite substantial progress in the univariate setting, achieving multivariate calibration remains challenging. Recent work has introduced pre-rank functions, scalar projections of multivariate forecasts and observations, as flexible diagnostics for assessing specific aspects of multivariate calibration, but their use has largely been limited to post-hoc evaluation. We propose a regularization-based calibration method that enforces multivariate calibration during training of multivariate distributional regression models using pre-rank functions. We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution. Through simulation studies and experiments on 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that the proposed approach substantially improves multivariate pre-rank calibration without compromising predictive accuracy, and that the PCA pre-rank reveals dependence-structure misspecifications that are not detected by existing pre-ranks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\uff08pre-rank\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ePCA\u7684\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u572818\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6PCA\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u6bd4\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684pre-rank \u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9519\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165pre-rank \u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684PCA-based pre-rank\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5bf918\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cfpre-rank \u6821\u51c6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1bPCA pre-rank \u8fd8\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408PCA\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9519\u914d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684pre-rank\u3002"}}

Piecewise-constant leaf predictions are bounded by the training targets and often become overconfident under distribution shift. We propose a single-tree Bayesian model that extends VSPYCT by equipping each leaf with a GP predictor. Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \\gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u6811\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b(GP)\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5288\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u533a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5728\u53f6\u5b50\u5916\u63a8\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3bGP\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u88c2\u6811\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u754c\u9650\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9047\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5728VSPYCT\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u914d\u5907\u4e00\u4e2aGP\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u659c\u5411\u5206\u5272\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u533a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u53c2\u6570\u4e0eGP\u540e\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u843d\u5728\u53f6\u5b50\u8bad\u7ec3\u652f\u6301\u4e4b\u5916\u65f6\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3bGP\u5916\u63a8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5916\u63a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u659c\u5411\u6811\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7GP\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u659c\u5411\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u65ad\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Codes in https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning", "summary": "Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks.

By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $\u03c0$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative. Our results improve previous work on non-log-concave sampling in terms of a more general framework and assumptions.

This perspective enables principled architectural design using classical optimization ideas. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles.

Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features.

Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$.

Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs can generate tokens in arbitrary order. While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant. Watermarks are detected via elevated parity-matching statistics, and a sliding-window detector ensures robustness under post-editing operations including insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.", "AI": {"tldr": "dgMARK \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u672a\u906e\u63a9\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u54c8\u5e0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5947\u5076\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u6c34\u5370\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u77bb\u4e0e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u63d2\u5165\u3001\u5220\u9664\u3001\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u6539\u5199\uff09\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u65b0\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u3001\u4e14\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "dgMARK \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u672a\u906e\u63a9\uff08unmasking\uff09\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5019\u9009 token \u6ee1\u8db3\u7531\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u54c8\u5e0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5947\u5076\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u505a\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u71b5\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u65e0\u7f1d\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u524d\u77bb\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u5947\u5076\u6027\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u63d2\u5165/\u5220\u9664/\u66ff\u6362/\u6539\u5199\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "dgMARK \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e dLLMs \u7684\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability. Experimental results demonstrate that RLRR yields consistent performance improvements over standard group-based baselines across reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6 RLRR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u66ff\u4ee3\u7edd\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec4\u57fa\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5217\u8868\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5bf9 ranking\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u7ec4\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u540c\u7ec4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f80\u5f80\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u533a\u95f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5747\u503c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u9700\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ece\u7edd\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u5411\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RLRR \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u5f62\u5851\u4ece\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u8f6c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 Ranking Reward Model\uff08\u5217\u8868\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea7\u751f\u7ec4\u5185\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u540d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7ec4\u5185\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRLRR \u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7ec4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RLRR \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "DCR\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1f\u8d85\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\u63cf\u8ff0\u6807\u5b9a\u9879\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u79e9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u8282\u7701\u6700\u591a36%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684 conformal prediction \u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u5206\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDistribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u3002\u7edd\u5bf9\u79e9\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u9879\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u79e4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u670d\u4ece\u8d1f\u8d85\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u5b9a conformal \u9608\u503c\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCR\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a36%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u79e9\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u5206\u5e03\uff0cDCR\u5728\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u7684 conformal ranking \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Appendix by Damion Harvey. Damion Harvey is the primary author", "summary": "We consider the problem of unsupervised skill segmentation and hierarchical structure discovery in reinforcement learning. While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u51fa\u6280\u80fd\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38RL\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5c06\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4ee5\u6280\u80fd\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f4e\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u5728 Craftax \u548c\u672a\u7ecf\u4fee\u6539\u7684 Minecraft \u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u5c42\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38RL\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u5728 Craftax \u4e0e Minecraft \u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5c42\u7ea7\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4RL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6280\u80fd\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.
