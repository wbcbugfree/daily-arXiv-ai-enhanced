Comparing Political Framing in Wikipedia and Grokipedia on Controversial Topics", "comment": null, "summary": "Online encyclopedias are central to contemporary information infrastructures and have become focal points of debates over ideological bias. Wikipedia, in particular, has long been accused of left-leaning bias, while Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia launched by xAI, has been framed as a right-leaning alternative. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia on well-established politically contested topics. Specifically, we examine differences in semantic framing, political orientation, and content prioritization. We find that semantic similarity between the two platforms decays across article sections and diverges more strongly on controversial topics than on randomly sampled ones. Additionally, we show that both encyclopedias predominantly exhibit left-leaning framings, although Grokipedia exhibits a more bimodal distribution with increased prominence of right-leaning content.

To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence.

Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u8bed\u4e49ID\u8868\u793a\u3001\u9879\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fGRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u65e5\u672a\u6765\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u597d\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u4e3b\u5bfc\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7528\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c06\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e14\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u6613\u88ab\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u4e3b\u5bfc\u504f\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8d1f\u5411\u5174\u8da3\u3001\u5e76\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "(1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49ID\u8868\u793a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(2) \u5f15\u5165\u9879\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff1b(3) \u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fGRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6b63\u8d1f\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff1b(4) \u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u89c4\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u8d1f\u9879\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8d1f\u504f\u597d\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u65e5\u672a\u6765\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b0\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u9519\u914d\uff1b", "result": "\u539f\u6587\u6458\u8981\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u5347\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u4e3b\u5bfc\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8d1f\u5411\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u82e5\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies.

Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u56e0\u679cMoE\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u89c6-\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u7eaf\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52MoE\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u8def\u7531\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7834\u574f\u548ctrain\u2013inference\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08null\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8def\u7531\u6c60\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08null experts\uff09\uff0c\u8ba9\u8def\u7531\u65f6\u6bb5\u53ef\u6307\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u6216\u7a7a\u69fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u4fc3\u4f7f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5747\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u671f\u671bFLOPs\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd+\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5339\u914d\u7684\u671f\u671bFLOPs\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4f1a\u628a\u89c6\u89c9token\u8def\u7531\u5230\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6bd4\u6587\u672ctoken\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u8def\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u53ef\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52MoE\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep \"academic value\", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys.

However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MMGRid\uff1a\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f51\u683c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5f15\u3002", "motivation": "GR \u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5f20\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff08MM\uff09\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u7684 GR \u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u4e9f\u5f85\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa MMGRid\uff1a\u4ee5\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8de8\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u6743\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u63a2\u7a76\u6700\u4f73\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u53d6\u6307\u5f15\u3002", "result": "\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u2460 \u76f4\u63a5\u4ece LLM \u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f token \u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u2461 \u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u2462 \u6700\u4f18\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "MMGRid \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790 GR \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u5e26\u6743\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u843d\u5730\u6307\u5f15\uff0c\u4ea6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c GR \u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, they are typically trained in centralized settings where all training and downstream datasets are gathered in a central server, limiting the deployment in privacy-sensitive and geographically distributed scenarios. In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation. (3) Unified Framework: We consolidate shallow adaptation, explaining degradation patterns and providing a foundation for mitigation strategies.

However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim. To consider the personalized addiction patterns, AddictSim uses a mean-to-adapted strategy with group relative policy optimization training. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that AddictSim consistently outperforms existing training strategies. Our simulation results show that integrating diversity-aware algorithms can mitigate addictive behaviors well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u763e\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u6210\u763e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa AddictSim \u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6210\u763e\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u5377\u6216\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u6210\u763e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u763e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa AddictSim\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 mean-to-adapted \u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u5728\u4e24\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u6210\u763e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "AddictSim \u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6210\u763e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u6210\u763e\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u763e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5bf9\u6210\u763e\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u7f13\u89e3\u3002"}}

We find that standard post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exacerbate this issue by rewarding confident, direct answers, thereby inducing overconfidence and discouraging the model from seeking clarification. To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity.

However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u653f\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff0cRAG \u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0cAdvanced RAG \u5728\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u503c\uff1b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5757\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4ecd\u9650\u5236\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5931\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6743\u5a01 CDC \u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30 Vanilla\u3001Basic RAG \u4e0e Advanced RAG \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5 Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 \u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u914d\u5408 all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9 CDC \u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6307\u5bfc\u6587\u6863\u6784\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83 Vanilla LLM\u3001Basic RAG\u3001Advanced RAG\uff08\u542b cross-encoder \u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u5b57\u7b26\u5206\u5757\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e token \u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5757\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4ee5\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u60c5\u666f\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "Basic RAG \u76f8\u8f83 Vanilla \u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ece 0.347 \u5230 0.621\uff0cAdvanced RAG \u7684\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe 0.797\uff1b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5185\u95ee\u7b54\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f46\u5206\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5728\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cAdvanced RAG \u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u5757\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.\n  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data.

While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from \"over-correction\", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.\n  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOGIC: \u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6570\u51e0\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347 Speech LLM \u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u5728 Phi-4-MM\u300111 \u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0 9% \u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0 0.30%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 Speech LLM \u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5b9e\u4f53\u5217\u8868\u589e\u591a\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u53ca\u201c\u4e22\u5931\u4e2d\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002GEC \u867d\u53ef\u6539\u5199\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u672a spoken \u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9762\u5411\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53cb\u597d\u3002\u4ee5 Phi-4-MM \u6a21\u578b\u5728 11 \u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u53ca\u8bef\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cLOGIC \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747 9% \u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bef\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea6 0.30%\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u6539\u5584\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002", "conclusion": "LOGIC \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u7f6e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e GEC \u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea0\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) offers proven techniques to compress these models, the lack of a unified, production-grade library prevents widely adopting these methods. We present Panther, a PyTorch-compatible library that consolidates established RandNLA algorithms into a single high-performance framework. Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit \"moral remorse\" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5LLM\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u4f24\u5bb3\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u614c\u4e71\u5e76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u66f4\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u4e0e\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u8bef\u4e92\u76f8\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u4ee5\u5f80\u5bf9LLM\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u63a7\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u53d6\u5411\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5448\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u5e76\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001ChatGPT-4o\u3001Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411\u3001Claude Sonnet 3.7\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u672c/\u65e0\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u201c\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5229\u4e14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eba\u9020\u6210\u6210\u672c\u201d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u5176\u4e2dClaude\u4e0eMistral\u5bf9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f24\u53ca\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u614c\u4e71\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8865\u507f\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u504f\u5411\u6700\u540e\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u4e0e\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u8bef\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u2018\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u5e72\u6d89\u2019\uff0c\u5373\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u6700\u540e\u5448\u73b0\u65f6\u66f4\u6613\u4e0e\u4e4b\u540c\u610f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5448\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u8c03\u9002\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5448\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "KD\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff1b\u4f46\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6837\u672c\u5360\u6bd4\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\uff0cKD\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76KD\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5728KD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4e09\u5927LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83KD\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728Pythia\u3001OLMo-2\u3001Qwen-3\u4e09\u5927LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548cFineWeb\u3001Wikitext\u3001Nemotron-CC-v2\u4e09\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u84b8\u998f\uff08\u8f6f\u3001\u786c\uff09\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528ez\u56de\u5fc6/\u91cd\u73b0\u7b49\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u5229\u7528zlib\u71b5\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\u3001\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a1) \u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff1b2) \u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6781\u5927\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u7ea6\u536095%\u5de6\u53f3\uff1b3) \u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7zlib\u71b5\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b4) \u867d\u7136\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7387\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u786c\u84b8\u998f inherites \u4e86\u6bd4\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u591a2.7\u500d\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u7279\u6709\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u3002"}}

Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios.

Using the Chameleon dataset, we present three key findings. First, inspired by Latent State-Trait theory, we decompose variance and find that 74\\% is within-person(state) while only 26\\% is between-person (trait). Second, we find that LLMs are state-blind: they focus on trait only, and produce similar responses regardless of state. Third, we find that reward models react to user state, but inconsistently: different models favor or penalize the same users in opposite directions.

This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77.

It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models (\"creative oracle\"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems (\"expert archivist\"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system (\"rigorous archivist\"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%).

We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\\mathbb{G}_1$, $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_3$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$+$\\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks.

However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated.

We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \\textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \\textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).\n  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs.

We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u572830\u6e56 Maine \u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MICE\u7f3a\u5931\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a5%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u9700\u8981\u7ea6176\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c/\u6e56\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u5386\u53f2\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u8fd1\u76845%\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u82e5\u4ec5\u75284\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u540c\u68375%\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u5185\u66ff\u4ee313\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a5%\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6700\u5c0f\u9700\u6c42\u7ea664\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u6837\u672c\u4e0e1\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u51b0\u5c01\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6709\u5bb3\u85fb\u534e\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u805a\u7126\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53d6\u6837\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u9a71\u52a8\u6e56\u6cca\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea Maine \u768430\u4e2a\u6e56\u7684\u4e09\u5341\u5e74\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5f55\uff1b\u7f3a\u5931\u4f7f\u7528MICE\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u91cd\u63d2\u8865\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u516d\u79cd\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u4ee5nMAE\u4e3a\u8de8\u6e56\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8fd1\u671f\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u57285%\u5168\u5386\u53f2\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff08\u5728\u5012\u5e8f\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff09\u7ea6176\u6837\u672c/\u6e56\uff1b\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u4e3a4\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4e0e13\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7b49\u6548\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a5%\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\uff0c\u7d04\u970064\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u6837\u672c\u4e0e1\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u7f3a\u5931\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u7528MICE\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u6e56\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u516c\u5141\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u80cc\u5411\u6700\u8fd1\u5386\u53f2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6700\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u7ea6176\u4e2a/\u6e56\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5dee\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc75%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53d1\u73b04\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee313\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e005%\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u53d6\u6837\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u7ea664\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u6837\u672c\u53ca1\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d6\u6837\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6e56\u6cca\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u9a71\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5236\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u4f7f\u57285%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u5185\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5386\u53f2\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales.

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0eMRI\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u533a\u5206\u975e\u5178\u578b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5(atAD)\u4e0e\u975e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d(N-AD-CI)\uff1b\u5728NACC\u4e0eADNI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9atAD\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u56de\u5fc6\u7387\u4ece52%\u63d0\u5347\u81f369%\uff08NACC\uff09\u548c\u4ece34%\u63d0\u5347\u81f377%\uff08ADNI\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5178\u578bAD\u5e38\u88ab\u8bef\u8bca\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e14\u6613\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9atAD\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u4e0e\u5168\u8111MRI\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u7ec4\u4eba\u7fa4\uff08tAD\u3001atAD\u3001\u975eAD\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u7167\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Boruta\u7279\u5f81\u7b5b\u9009\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u533a\u5206\u7ec4\u522b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8111\u533a\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53caNACC/ADNI\u51711410\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u591aMRI\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4ee5\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728NACC\u5c06atAD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece52%\u63d0\u5347\u81f369%\uff0c\u5728ADNI\u4ece34%\u63d0\u5347\u81f377%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91cf\u8868\u4e0eMRI\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u7684ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e38\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684atAD\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5178\u578batAD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Boruta\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u8bca\u65ad\u7ec4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8111\u533a\u3002"}}

Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.\n  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output.

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\u03c0$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise).

But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the \"default\" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West.

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5de5\u4f5c\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6210\u529f\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5fae\u5206\u53ef\u5bfc\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u9009\u53d6\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e24\u7ec4\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u505c\u6b62\u70b9\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs.

Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. \\ours achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction. Our approach effectively addresses practical scenarios involving up to 75$\\%$ missing rate, to some extent bridging the existing gap between idealized research settings and the complexities of real-world scientific computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0cLatent Autoregressive Neural Operator\uff08\u7b80\u79f0\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6 POBench-PDE\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eL2\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u5730\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u7f3a\u53e3\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b-\u89e3\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u63a9\u7801\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5730\u63a9\u853d\u89c2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2) \u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u4ee5\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u89e3\u573a\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa POBench-PDE \u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e09\u7c7bPDE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u7f3a\u5931\u4e14\u7f3a\u5931\u7387<50%\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b018\u201369%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6c14\u5019\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u76d1\u7763\u7f3a\u53e3\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).\n  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises (\"Sycophancy\").\n  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9762\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7075\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728HaluBench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea60.8669 AUROC\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5feb\uff0c\u4e14\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u7406\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u8d1f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u5236\u7ea6\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8 priors \u7684\u201c\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u201d\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u4e2d\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9879\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u5b9e\u4f53\u805a\u7126\u5438\u6536\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u9644\u3001\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001BASE\u3001IMPROVED \u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8eHaluBench(n=200\uff0c\u5e73\u8861)\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf0.8017 AUROC\uff1bBASE 0.8274\uff1bIMPROVED 0.8669\uff08\u63d0\u53474.95%\uff09\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4ec5200 vs Lynx 15000\uff1b\u63a8\u74065ms vs 5s\uff1b\u6a21\u578b<1M\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8d1f\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u7406\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u524d\u63d0\u7684\u201c\u987a\u4ece\u6027\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u4fe1\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u9760\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5224\u51b3\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

We characterize MDLM behavior along two dimensions -- parallelism strength and generation order -- using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau. We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require \"backward information\" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "MDLMs\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5e76\u884c\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u8de8\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u89e3\u7801\u5448\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1a\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u201c\u80cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u72ec\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u5148\u586b\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u70b9\u3002\u63d0\u51fa Generate-then-Edit \u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7406\u89e3 MDLM \u5728\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u4e24\u7ef4\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57288\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41 MDLM\uff08\u89c4\u6a21\u81f3100B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf958\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u6700\u7ec8\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff08AFP\uff09\u548c Kendall's tau \u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Generate-then-Edit \u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "result": "MDLMs \u5728\u5e76\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u89e3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1a\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u800c\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u72ec\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cMDLM\u503e\u5411\u5148\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Generate-then-Edit \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "MDLMs \u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u8fbe\u5230\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982 Generate-then-Edit\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MedConf \u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u79ef\u7d2f\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u5957\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\u5bf9\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u3001\u9759\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5c31\u8bca\u4e2d\u8bc1\u636e\u6301\u7eed\u79ef\u7d2f\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u9010\u6b65\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e09\u7c7b\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f8327\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa MedConf\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u75c7\u72b6\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6574\u5408\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u7ec4\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMedConf \u5728 AUROC \u4e0e Pearson \u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u591a\u75c5\u5171\u5b58\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u8db3\u6027\u662f\u53ef\u4fe1\u533b\u7597\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

An agent aims to determine whether there exists a qualified arm whose mean reward is not less than a known threshold $\u03bc_0$, or to output \\textsf{None} if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\u03b4$, while making expected total pulling times $\\mathbb{E}\u03c4$ as small as possible. We work on 1-identification with two main contributions. (1) We utilize an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound of $\\mathbb{E}\u03c4$, when there is at least one qualified arm. (2) We design a new algorithm, deriving tight upper bounds whose gap to lower bounds are up to a polynomial of logarithm factor across all problem instance.

This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

Historic datasets from related problems can be exploited to help improve performance of Bayesian optimisation by adapting transfer learning methods to various components of the Bayesian optimisation pipeline. In this study we perform an empirical analysis of various ensemble-based transfer learning Bayesian optimisation methods and pipeline components. We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance. We find that in general, two components that help improve transfer learning Bayesian optimisation performance are warm start initialisation and constraining weights used with ensemble surrogate model to be positive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u6743\u53ca\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6548\u65f6\u7684\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u6743\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e09\u7ec4\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ca\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u5e26\u6b63\u6743\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u518d\u6709\u76ca\u65f6\u7684\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u7ec4\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5c06\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u6b63\u6570\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u6743\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e09\u7ec4\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u5c06\u96c6\u6210\u6743\u91cd\u8bbe\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes multivariate evaluation of LLM value-alignment using correlation patterns, not just marginal distributions; compares persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning against World Values Survey, finds marginals improve with demographic fine-tuning but correlation structures remain poorly captured.", "motivation": "Marginal alignment is insufficient to capture complex, correlated value structures inferred from population surveys; representativeness requires preserving multivariate relationships.", "method": "Introduce a framework to evaluate multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginals; empirically compare two steering techniques (persona prompting vs demographic fine-tuning) against human responses from the World Values Survey.", "result": "Demographic fine-tuning better matches marginal distributions than persona prompting, but neither method reproduces the gold-standard multivariate correlation patterns; overall representativeness is not achieved.", "conclusion": "Representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment; relying solely on marginals can mask structural misalignment, leading to overly optimistic assessments of model capabilities."}}

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains.

This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII): a framework to enable models trained on fixed-column tables to incorporate new columns during inference, cast as an information bottleneck optimization.

Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments.

This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities.

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts.

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u5185\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6GNN\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eI/O\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Federated Graph Neural Networks (FGNNs) \u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u6700\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CeFGC\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u672c\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u9001\u7ed9\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u518d\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u53d1\u56de\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff1b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7528\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u56fe\u62fc\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u672c\u5730GNN\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0a\u4f20\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7ed9\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u6536\u655b\u4e3a\u5e38\u65703\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cCeFGC\u5728\u975eIID\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CeFGC\u4e3aFGNN\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u5171\u4eab\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

Moreover, our framework is built on lightweight LLMs, enabling it to operate fully on local machines in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591aLLM\u6df7\u5408\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6 Mixture of LLMs in the Loop Active Learning\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u6ce8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 annotation discrepancy \u4e0e negative learning \u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLMs\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u53ef\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6LLM\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\uff1a\u5c06LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Mixture of LLMs in the Loop Active Learning \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 annotation discrepancy \u548c negative learning \u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLMs\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672c\u5730\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6LLM\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u73af\u8282\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591aLLM\u878d\u5408\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ErrorMap \u4e0e ErrorAtlas\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u4ece\u6839\u6e90\u5206\u6790LLM\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u7ed9\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6210\u529f/\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u201c\u5931\u8d25\u7b7e\u540d\u201d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9519\u8bef\u8c31\uff08ErrorMap\uff09\uff0c\u6c47\u96c6\u6210 ErrorAtlas \u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572835\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u300183\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u751f\u6210 ErrorAtlas\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e38\u89c1\u4e14\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5982\u8f93\u51fa\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u9898\u610f\u8bef\u89e3\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u516c\u5f00\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals.

This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching.

We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning.

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICON is a neuro-symbolic causal framework for text-based person search that enforces geometric invariance, background independence, saliency regularization, and topological consistency to improve robustness and generalization.", "motivation": "TBPS suffers from passive observation, spurious correlations, and spatial semantic misalignment, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts; a causal-invariant approach is needed.", "method": "1) Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to penalize bounding box noise and sever location shortcuts; 2) Counterfactual Context Disentanglement via semantic-driven background transplantation to ignore background interference; 3) Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to mitigate local saliency bias and ensure holistic completeness; 4) Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment to constrain feature matching with topological human-structure priors.", "result": "ICON achieves competitive or leading accuracy on standard TBPS benchmarks and shows strong robustness to occlusion, background interference, and localization noise.", "conclusion": "The work advances TBPS by moving from co-occurrence fitting to learning causal invariance, integrating causal and topological priors through neuro-symbolic design."}}

To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage.

Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.\n  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynthOCR-Gen \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5408\u6210OCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u9762\u5411 Kashmiri \u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3001Unicode\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4e0e\u591a\u5b57\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\u53ca\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86600k\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u6bb5 Kashmiri \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00AI\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u5e26\u6709\u590d\u6742 Perso-Arabic \u811a\u672c\u7684OCR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6bb5\uff08\u5b57\u7b26/\u5355\u8bcd/ n-gram/\u53e5\u5b50/\u884c\uff09\u3001Unicode \u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4e0e\u811a\u672c\u7eaf\u5ea6\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5b57\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\u5e76\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 25+ \u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u6587\u6863\u964d\u89e3\uff08\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u4f2a\u5f71\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u5c06\u6570\u5b57Unicode\u8bed\u6599\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa600k\u8bcdsegment Kashmiri \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u5728 HuggingFace\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u7684 Kashmiri \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u5165\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "conclusion": "SynthOCR-Gen \u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684 OCR \u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb underserved writing systems \u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00 AI \u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u3002"}}

Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model.

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u7684\u7b80\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f83\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u7ec4\u9700\u5ba1\u614e\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4ecd\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u533b\u9662\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5c31\u8bca\u6d41\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u8026\u5408\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5c31\u8bca\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u53ca\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u5e74 SafeGraph \u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e0e Google Maps Reviews \u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e94\u7c7b\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08Naive Regression\u3001Gradient Boosting\u3001Multilayer Perceptrons\u3001Deep Gravity\u3001Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 SHAP \u4e0e PDP \u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4f11\u65af\u987f\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5c31\u8bca\u6d41\u91cf\u3002", "result": "Deep Gravity \u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff1b\u533b\u9662\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001 ICU \u5360\u7528\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u70ed\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5c31\u8bca\u6d41\u91cf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u51fa\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u77ed\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u957f\u7a0b\u53d7\u533b\u9662\u8bc4\u5206\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u65cf\u7fa4\uff08\u5982\u767d\u4eba\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u4e9a\u88d4\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSES \u9ad8\u7684\u5730\u533a\u5c31\u8bca\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u533b\u7597\u4e0d\u8db3\u6240\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u5c31\u8bca\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u4ea6\u63ed\u793a\u5730\u57df\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u5c40\u9650\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e representativeness\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $\u0398(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound.

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08CFI\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u6001\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u5408\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6765\u81ea\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u53ef\u884c\u533a\u57df\u3002\u9700\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u6b63\u6001\u6d41\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u628a\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u5408\u8bbe\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u518d\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u9519\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u5355\u5143\u7ec4\uff08SCUC\uff09\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e26/\u4e0d\u5e26\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6ca1\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u96c6\u5408\u672a\u5fc5\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u96c6\u5408\u4e5f\u672a\u5fc5\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0cCFI\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CFI\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u3002"}}

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests.

We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\\left(T^{\\max\\{\u03b2,1-\u03b2\\}}\\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\\left(T^{1-\u03b2}\\right)$ for any $\u03b2\\in (0,1)$.

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change.

This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable.

However, MAP estimation is generally intractable, and remains hard even under many common structural constraints and approximation schemes. We introduce $\\mathit{probably\\ approximately\\ correct}$ (PAC) algorithms for MAP inference that provide provably optimal solutions under variable and fixed computational budgets. We characterize tractability conditions for PAC-MAP using information theoretic measures that can be estimated from finite samples.

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_\u03c1$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $\u03a9$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $\u03a9$. Given a probability measure $\u03bc$ on $\u03a9$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $\u03c6\\to \\int_\u03a9K(\\cdot,x)\u03c6(x)d\u03bc(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $\u03a9$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $\u03bc$ supported on $\u03a9$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + \u03b5})$ for any $\u03b5> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $\u03bc$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $\u03b5$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(\u03b5^{-d_\u03c1}\\log\\frac{1}\u03b5\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_\u03c1$, even though $d_K = d_\u03c1$ provably holds on regular domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6 d_rho\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e Minkowski \u9636\u6570\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u548c d_K\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e n-width \u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\uff08KRR\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u53ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u652f\u6301\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0cKRR \u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1 n-width \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5206\u5f62\u96c6\u5408\u7684 d_K \u8ba1\u7b97\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49 d_rho \u4e0e d_K\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u6838\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a \u03a9 \u4e0b\uff0cn-width \u80fd\u591f\u523b\u753b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709 \u03bc \u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5bfc\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u91cf n \u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u8bef\u5dee\u754c O(n^{-(2+d_K)/(2+2 d_K) + \u03b5})\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1 n-width \u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u03b5-\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6 O(\u03b5^{-d_rho} log(1/\u03b5))\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5f62\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97 d_K\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u968f d_K \u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u5728 Laplace kernel \u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cd_K \u53ef\u80fd\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e d_rho\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u57df\u4e0a d_K = d_rho\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa d_K \u8f83\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ece\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u65ad n-width \u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9 fractals \u7684\u4f8b\u8bc1\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6 d_K \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e Minkowski \u7ef4\u5ea6 d_rho\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff1bn-width \u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

To address this issue, this thesis propose a dynamic board expansion mechanism in which the game board grows automatically during play.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u7cfb\u7edf(GGS)\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u68cb\u76d8\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u68cb\u76d8\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5e9e\u5927\u68cb\u76d8\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u677f\u68cb\u6e38\u620f\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u9759\u6001\u68cb\u76d8\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5f88\u5927\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728GGS\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u68cb\u76d8\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u589e\u957f\u68cb\u76d8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u5448\u73b0\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u53ca\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u6216\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6b63\u6587\u4e2d\u67e5\u770b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u9884\u671f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u68cb\u76d8\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u68cb\u76d8\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u677fless\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Beat-SSL \u53cc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 ECG \u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u8282\u5f8b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e ECG \u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u6ce8 ECG \u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528 ECG \u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4e14\u786c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349 ECG \u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5fc3\u7535\u7684\u8282\u5f8b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8df3\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u523b\u753b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u5168\u7403\u8282\u5f8b\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e ECG \u5206\u5272\uff1b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a ECG \u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Beat-SSL \u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684 93% \u6027\u80fd\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u65b9\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea6 4%\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u53cc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "Beat-SSL \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9 ECG \u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erd\u0151s' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models.

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa counterfactual training\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u82e5\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5176\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u6807\u5d4c\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5 counterfactuals \u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff1b\u786e\u4fdd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u5177\u5907\u56fa\u6709\u3001\u7406\u60f3\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5c06\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
