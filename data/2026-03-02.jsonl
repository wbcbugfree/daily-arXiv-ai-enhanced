Recent advances in agentic-RAG and tool-augmented LLM architectures have introduced alternative approaches to information retrieval and processing. We question how much additional value vector databases and semantic search bring to RAG over simple, agentic keyword search in documents for question-answering. In this study, we conducted a systematic comparison between RAG-based systems and tool-augmented LLM agents, specifically evaluating their retrieval mechanisms and response quality when the agent only has access to basic keyword search tools. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that tool-based keyword search implementations within an agentic framework can attain over $90\\%$ of the performance metrics compared to traditional RAG systems without using a standing vector database. Our approach is simple to implement, cost effective, and is particularly useful in scenarios requiring frequent updates to knowledge bases."}

Recent work, Think-Then-Embed (TTE), shows that incorporating multimodal reasoning to elicit additional informative tokens before embedding can further improve retrieval. In this paper, we extend this paradigm with TTE-v2, a hybrid multimodal retrieval framework that introduces reasoning-driven performance scaling based on additional input token budget rather than model or embedding size. Our approach augments the initial multimodal retrieval with additional reasoning steps for reranking, enabling more expressive query-candidate interactions at test time. The reranking stage further provides fine-grained supervision for hard negative mining and false negative filtering, creating a feedback loop that effectively strengthens the upstream retriever. This cascaded design delivers substantial test-time improvements based on intermediate reasoning token scaling. Experiments on the MMEB-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TTE-v2-7B achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.7%, and that TTE-v2-2B matches or surpasses leading 7B models trained with significantly larger external data.

Recent retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approaches improve grounding but struggle with multi-hop reasoning, citation chaining, and cross-domain dependencies inherent to legal texts.\n  We propose a domain partitioned hybrid RAG and Knowledge Graph architecture designed specifically for Indian legal research. The system integrates three specialized RAG pipelines covering Supreme Court case law, statutory and constitutional texts, and the Indian Penal Code, each optimized for domain specific retrieval. To enable relational reasoning beyond semantic similarity, we construct a Neo4j based Legal Knowledge Graph capturing structured relationships among cases, statutes, IPC sections, judges, and citations. An LLM driven agentic orchestrator dynamically routes queries across retrieval modules and the knowledge graph, fusing evidence into grounded and citation aware responses.\n  We evaluate the system using a 40 question synthetic legal question answer benchmark curated from authoritative Indian legal sources and assessed via an LLM as a Judge framework. Results show that the hybrid architecture achieves a 70 percent pass rate, substantially outperforming a RAG only baseline at 37.5 percent, with marked improvements in completeness and legal reasoning quality. These findings demonstrate that combining domain partitioned retrieval with structured relational knowledge provides a scalable and interpretable foundation for advanced legal AI systems in the Indian judicial context."}

Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

Prior defenses, based on applications of DPO, NPO, and similar algorithms, reduce the likelihood of harmful continuations, but not robustly so: they are vulnerable to adversarial prompting and easily undone by fine-tuning-based relearning attacks. Indeed, research has shown that these edits to the model are superficial: linear probing reveals that harmful \"directions\" remain present in representations. To address this, we propose Representation Erasure-based Preference Optimization (REPO), reformulating detoxification as a token-level preference problem. Using a novel objective with preference data, we force the representations of toxic continuations to converge toward their benign counterparts. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that this granular approach is critical: unlike baselines, REPO induces deep, localized edits to toxicity-encoding neurons while preserving general model utility. Exhaustive evaluations show that REPO achieves state-of-the-art robustness, stopping sophisticated threats-including relearning attacks and enhanced GCG jailbreaks-where existing representation- and output-based methods fail."}

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Higress RAG MCP Server, a novel, enterprise-centric architecture designed to resolve these bottlenecks through a \"Full-Link Optimization\" strategy.

However, limited awareness of existing task-specific resources in low-resource languages hinders research. This challenge is especially acute in linguistically diverse countries, such as India. Cross-task profiling of existing Indian speech datasets can alleviate the data scarcity challenge. This involves investigating the utility of datasets across multiple downstream tasks rather than focusing on a single task. Prior surveys typically catalogue datasets for a single task, leaving comprehensive cross-task profiling as an open opportunity. Therefore, we propose Task-Lens, a cross-task survey that assesses the readiness of 50 Indian speech datasets spanning 26 languages for nine downstream speech tasks. First, we analyze which datasets contain metadata and properties suitable for specific tasks. Next, we propose task-aligned enhancements to unlock datasets to their full downstream potential. Finally, we identify tasks and Indian languages that are critically underserved by current resources. Our findings reveal that many Indian speech datasets contain untapped metadata that can support multiple downstream tasks. By uncovering cross-task linkages and gaps, Task-Lens enables researchers to explore the broader applicability of existing datasets and to prioritize dataset creation for underserved tasks and languages."}

However, fine-tuning on user logs inadvertently encodes sensitive attributes into model parameters, raising critical privacy concerns. Existing Machine Unlearning (MU) techniques struggle to navigate this tension due to the Polysemy Dilemma, where neurons superimpose sensitive data with general reasoning patterns, leading to catastrophic utility loss under traditional gradient or pruning methods. To address this, we propose Utility-aware Contrastive AttenuatioN (U-CAN), a precision unlearning framework that operates on low-rank adapters. U-CAN quantifies risk by contrasting activations and focuses on neurons with asymmetric responses that are highly sensitive to the forgetting set but suppressed on the retention set. To safeguard performance, we introduce a utility-aware calibration mechanism that combines weight magnitudes with retention-set activation norms, assigning higher utility scores to dimensions that contribute strongly to retention performance. Unlike binary pruning, which often fragments network structure, U-CAN develop adaptive soft attenuation with a differentiable decay function to selectively down-scale high-risk parameters on LoRA adapters, suppressing sensitive retrieval pathways and preserving the topological connectivity of reasoning circuits. Experiments on two public datasets across seven metrics demonstrate that U-CAN achieves strong privacy forgetting, utility retention, and computational efficiency."}

To fill this gap, we present a new framework that combines transformers and graph neural networks and aligns different representations for solving next-item prediction task.

Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models."}

For unary fixed-frequency encodings, circuit depth scales as O(omega_max * (omega_max + epsilon^{-2})) with target frequency magnitude omega_max and precision epsilon. Trainable-frequency approaches theoretically reduce this to match the target spectrum size, requiring only as many encoding gates as frequencies in the target spectrum. Despite this compelling efficiency, their practical effectiveness hinges on a key assumption: that gradient-based optimization can drive prefactors to arbitrary target values. We demonstrate through systematic experiments that frequency prefactors exhibit limited trainability: movement is constrained to approximately +/-1 units with typical learning rates. When target frequencies lie outside this reachable range, optimization frequently fails. To overcome this frequency reachability limitation, we propose grid-based initialization using ternary encodings, which generate dense integer frequency spectra. While this approach requires O(log_3(omega_max)) encoding gates -- more than the theoretical optimum but exponentially fewer than fixed-frequency methods -- it ensures target frequencies lie within the locally reachable range. On synthetic targets with three shifted high frequencies, ternary grid initialization achieves a median R^2 score of 0.9969, compared to 0.1841 for the trainable-frequency baseline. For the real-world Flight Passengers dataset, ternary grid initialization achieves a median R^2 score of 0.9671, representing a 22.8% improvement over trainable-frequency initialization (median R^2 = 0.7876)."}

Modern systems therefore rely on multiple specialized retrieval channels to surface products, each designed to satisfy a specific objective. A key challenge is how to effectively merge documents from these heterogeneous channels into a single ranked list under strict latency constraints while optimizing for business KPIs such as user conversion. Rank-based fusion methods such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and Weighted Interleaving rely on fixed global channel weights and treat channels independently, failing to account for query-specific channel utility and cross-channel interactions. We observe that multi-channel fusion can be reformulated as a query-dependent learning-to-rank problem over heterogeneous candidate sources. In this paper, we propose a unified ranking model that learns to merge and rank documents from multiple retrieval channels. We formulate the problem as a channel-aware learning-to-rank task that jointly optimizes clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases while incorporating channel-specific objectives. We further incorporate recent user behavioral signals to capture short-term intent shifts that are critical for improving conversion in multi-channel ranking.

By representing shifts in the environment as interventions on this causal POMDP, the framework enables evaluating plans under hypothesized changes and actively identifying which components of the environment have been altered. We show how to maintain and update a belief over both the latent state and the underlying domain, and we prove that the value function remains piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) in this augmented belief space. Preservation of PWLC under distribution shifts has the advantage of maintaining the tractability of planning via $α$-vector-based POMDP methods."}

These queries exhibit diverse linguistic patterns, often lack explicit purchase intent, and require domain-specific knowledge reasoning for accurate interpretation. They also suffer from a shortage of reliable behavioral logs, which makes such queries a persistent challenge for retrieval optimization. To address these issues, we propose an efficient data synthesis framework tailored to retrieval involving long-tail, knowledge-intensive queries. The key idea is to implicitly distill the capabilities of a powerful offline query-rewriting model into an efficient online retrieval system. Leveraging the strong language understanding of LLMs, we train a multi-candidate query rewriting model with multiple reward signals and capture its rewriting capability in well-curated query-product pairs through a powerful offline retrieval pipeline. This design mitigates distributional shift in rewritten queries, which might otherwise limit incremental recall or introduce irrelevant products.

In this work, we introduce FHIRPath-QA, the first open dataset and benchmark for patient-specific QA that includes open-standard FHIRPath queries over real-world clinical data. We propose a text-to-FHIRPath QA paradigm that shifts reasoning from free-text generation to FHIRPath query synthesis, significantly reducing LLM usage. Built on MIMIC-IV on FHIR Demo, the dataset pairs over 14k natural language questions in patient and clinician phrasing with validated FHIRPath queries and answers. Further, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to deal with ambiguity in patient language and perform poorly in FHIRPath query synthesis. However, they benefit strongly from supervised fine-tuning. Our results highlight that text-to-FHIRPath synthesis has the potential to serve as a practical foundation for safe, efficient, and interoperable consumer health applications, and our dataset and benchmark serve as a starting point for future research on the topic.

In the min-max variant, the objective is to minimize the longest tour, reflecting workload balance. We propose a hybrid approach, Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt with Reinforcement Learning (RL-CMSA), for the symmetric single-depot min-max mTSP. The method iteratively constructs diverse solutions using probabilistic clustering guided by learned pairwise q-values, merges routes into a compact pool, solves a restricted set-covering MILP, and refines solutions via inter-route remove, shift, and swap moves. The q-values are updated by reinforcing city-pair co-occurrences in high-quality solutions, while the pool is adapted through ageing and pruning. This combination of exact optimization and reinforcement-guided construction balances exploration and exploitation. Computational results on random and TSPLIB instances show that RL-CMSA consistently finds (near-)best solutions and outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid genetic algorithm under comparable time limits, especially as instance size and the number of salesmen increase."}

In this paradigm, previously evaluated solutions are reused to guide the model toward new candidate solutions.

However, most existing methods rely on fixed search strategies with predefined knobs (e.g., explore-exploit ratios) that remain static throughout execution. While effective in some settings, these approaches often fail to adapt across tasks, or even within the same task as the search space changes over time. We introduce EvoX, an adaptive evolution method that optimizes its own evolution process. EvoX jointly evolves candidate solutions and the search strategies used to generate them, continuously updating how prior solutions are selected and varied based on progress. This enables the system to dynamically shift between different search strategies during the optimization process. Across nearly 200 real-world optimization tasks, EvoX outperforms existing AI-driven evolutionary methods including AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve on the majority of tasks."}

However, existing GR models typically perform single-pass decoding without explicit refinement, causing early deviations to accumulate and ultimately degrade recommendation quality. To tackle this problem, we propose GRC, which is, to our knowledge, the first structured reflection-correction framework for GR that extends standard decoding into a Generation-Reflection-Correction (GRC) process. Concretely, GRC introduces a supervised reflection-correction template that decomposes the decoding process into initial draft generation, multi-granular reflection, and reflection-guided correction, thereby enabling structured reflection and correction in the semantic token space. To further explore the enlarged refinement space introduced by the GRC process, we optimize the entire GRC trajectory with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, under a carefully designed reward function with token-level and trajectory-level signals. For efficient online serving, we propose an Entropy-Guided Reflection Scheduling (EGRS) strategy that dynamically allocates more correction budget to high-uncertainty decoding trajectories during beam search. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that GRC consistently outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 15.74%, and online A/B tests demonstrate its substantial practical value in large-scale industrial recommendation, delivering a 1.79% lift in advertising revenue with only modest latency overhead."}

SleepLM bridges natural language and multimodal polysomnography, enabling language-grounded representations of sleep physiology. To support this alignment, we introduce a multilevel sleep caption generation pipeline that enables the curation of the first large-scale sleep-text dataset, comprising over 100K hours of data from more than 10,000 individuals.

We argue that these limitations reflect structural properties of the supervision channel rather than model scale or optimization. We develop a unified theory showing that whenever the human supervision channel is not sufficient for a latent evaluation target, it acts as an information-reducing channel that induces a strictly positive excess-risk floor for any learner dominated by it. We formalize this Human-Bounded Intelligence limit and show that across six complementary frameworks (operator theory, PAC-Bayes, information theory, causal inference, category theory, and game-theoretic analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback), non-sufficiency yields strictly positive lower bounds arising from the same structural decomposition into annotation noise, preference distortion, and semantic compression. The theory explains why scaling alone cannot eliminate persistent human-aligned errors and characterizes conditions under which auxiliary non-human signals (e.g., retrieval, program execution, tools) increase effective supervision capacity and collapse the floor by restoring information about the latent target. Experiments on real preference data, synthetic known-target tasks, and externally verifiable benchmarks confirm the predicted structural signatures: human-only supervision exhibits a persistent floor, while sufficiently informative auxiliary channels strictly reduce or eliminate excess error."}

We introduce ProbCOPA, a dataset of 210 handcrafted probabilistic inferences in English, each annotated for inference likelihood by 25--30 human participants. We find that human responses are graded and varied, revealing probabilistic judgments of the inferences in our dataset. Comparing these judgments with responses from eight state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, we show that models consistently fail to produce human-like distributions. Finally, analyzing LLM reasoning chains, we find evidence of a common reasoning pattern used to evaluate such inferences. Our findings reveal persistent differences between humans and LLMs, and underscore the need to evaluate reasoning beyond deterministic settings."}

Although flexible nonlinear models can improve predictive accuracy, their limited interpretability can erode clinical trust. In fields such as imaging and omics, investigators commonly address visit- and instrument-specific artifacts by extracting stable signal through preprocessing and then fitting an interpretable linear model. We adopt the same strategy for questionnaire data by decoupling preprocessing from prediction: we restrict nonlinear capacity to a baseline preprocessing module that estimates stable item values, and then learn a linear mapping from these stabilized baseline items to future severity. We refer to this two-stage method as REFINE (Redundancy-Exploiting Follow-up-Informed Nonlinear Enhancement), which concentrates nonlinearity in preprocessing while keeping the prognostic relationship transparently linear and therefore globally interpretable through a coefficient matrix, rather than through post hoc local attributions. In experiments, REFINE outperforms other interpretable approaches while preserving clear global attribution of prognostic factors across psychiatric and non-psychiatric longitudinal prediction tasks."}

To address these issues, we propose FuXi-Linear, a linear-complexity model designed for efficient long-sequence recommendation. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) a Temporal Retention Channel that independently computes periodic attention weights using temporal data, preventing crosstalk between temporal and semantic signals; (2) a Linear Positional Channel that integrates positional information through learnable kernels within linear complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that FuXi-Linear exhibits a robust power-law scaling property at a thousand-length scale, a characteristic largely unexplored in prior linear recommendation studies. Extensive experiments on sequences of several thousand tokens demonstrate that FuXi-Linear outperforms state-of-the-art models in recommendation quality, while achieving up to 10$\\times$ speedup in the prefill stage and up to 21$\\times$ speedup in the decode stage compared to competitive baselines.

We first present new behavioral evidence from humans and large language models demonstrating the robustness of this apparent non-redundancy across contexts. We then show that, in language models, redundancy avoidance arises from two interacting mechanisms: models learn to bind contextually relevant information to repeated lexical items, and Transformer induction heads selectively attend to these context-licensed representations. We argue that this neural explanation sheds light on the mechanisms underlying context-sensitive semantic interpretation, and that it complements existing symbolic analyses."}

In this paper, we address what's wrong with our conception of AGI, and why, even in its most coherent formulation, it is a flawed concept to describe the future of AI. We explore whether the most widely accepted definitions are plausible, useful, and truly general. We argue that AI must embrace specialization, rather than strive for generality, and in its specialization strive for superhuman performance, and introduce Superhuman Adaptable Intelligence (SAI). SAI is defined as intelligence that can learn to exceed humans at anything important that we can do, and that can fill in the skill gaps where humans are incapable.

However, the annotation of human-understandable concepts requires extensive expert knowledge and labor, constraining the broad adoption of CBMs. On the other hand, there are a few works that leverage the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to construct concept bottlenecks. Nevertheless, they face two essential limitations: First, they overlook the uncertainty associated with the concepts annotated by LLMs and lack a valid mechanism to quantify uncertainty about the annotated concepts, increasing the risk of errors due to hallucinations from LLMs. Additionally, they fail to incorporate the uncertainty associated with these annotations into the learning process for concept bottleneck models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware CBM method, which not only rigorously quantifies the uncertainty of LLM-annotated concept labels with valid and distribution-free guarantees, but also incorporates quantified concept uncertainty into the CBM training procedure to account for varying levels of reliability across LLM-annotated concepts.

While social media platforms offer opportunities for early risk detection through online conversation trees, existing approaches face two major limitations: (1) They rely on predefined rules (e.g., quotes or relies) to log conversations that capture only a narrow spectrum of user interactions, and (2) They overlook hidden influences such as user conformity and suicide copycat behavior, which can significantly affect suicidal expression and propagation in online communities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent Causal Reasoning (MACR) framework that collaboratively employs a Reasoning Agent to scale user interactions and a Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent to mitigate harmful biases arising from hidden influences. The Reasoning Agent integrates cognitive appraisal theory to generate counterfactual user reactions to posts, thereby scaling user interactions. It analyses these reactions through structured dimensions, i.e., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns, with a dedicated sub-agent responsible for each dimension. The Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent mitigates hidden biases through a front-door adjustment strategy, leveraging the counterfactual user reactions produced by the Reasoning Agent. Through the collaboration of reasoning and bias-aware decision making, the proposed MACR framework not only alleviates hidden biases, but also enriches contextual information of user interactions with counterfactual knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world conversational datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MACR in identifying suicide risk."}

To address these limitations, this paper introduces PseudoAct, a novel framework for flexible planning and action control in LLM agents through pseudocode synthesis. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to express task-solving strategies as code, PseudoAct synthesizes a structured pseudocode plan that decomposes a task into subtasks and explicitly encodes control flow, including sequencing, conditionals, loops, parallel composition, and combinations of these logic primitives. Actions are then executed by following this global plan, making the decision logic explicit and temporally coherent. This design reduces redundant actions, prevents infinite loops, and avoids uninformative alternative exploration, enabling consistent and efficient long-horizon decision-making.

Prior clustered FL approaches also restrict knowledge and representation sharing to clients within the same cluster. This prevents cluster models from benefiting from the diverse client population across clusters. To address these limitations, FedDAG introduces a clustered FL framework, FedDAG, that employs a weighted, class-wise similarity metric that integrates both data and gradient information, providing a more holistic measure of similarity during clustering. In addition, FedDAG adopts a dual-encoder architecture for cluster models, comprising a primary encoder trained on its own clients' data and a secondary encoder refined using gradients from complementary clusters.

However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by \"pasting\" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments."}

ODAR uses a difficulty estimator grounded in amortized active inference to dynamically route queries between a heuristic Fast Agent and a deliberative Slow Agent.

Extensive evaluation across 23 benchmarks shows strong and consistent gains, including 98.2% accuracy on MATH and 54.8% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), while improving the compute-accuracy frontier under compute-matched settings. We also validate reproducibility on a fully open-source stack (Llama 4 + DeepSeek), where ODAR surpasses homogeneous sampling strategies while reducing computational costs by 82%.

Inadequate sample sizes can lead to overfitting, poor generalisability, and biased predictions. Existing approaches, such as heuristic rules, closed-form formulas, and simulation-based methods, vary in flexibility and accuracy, particularly for complex data structures and machine learning models. Methods: We review current methodologies for sample size estimation in prediction modelling and introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes between mean-based and assurance-based criteria. Building on this, we propose a novel simulation-based approach that integrates learning curves, Gaussian Process optimisation, and assurance principles to identify sample sizes that achieve target performance with high probability. This approach is implemented in pmsims, an open-source, model-agnostic R package. Results: Through case studies, we demonstrate that sample size estimates vary substantially across methods, performance metrics, and modelling strategies. Compared to existing tools, pmsims provides flexible, efficient, and interpretable solutions that accommodate diverse models and user-defined metrics while explicitly accounting for variability in model performance. Conclusions: Our framework and software advance sample size methodology for clinical prediction modelling by combining flexibility with computational efficiency. Future work should extend these methods to hierarchical and multimodal data, incorporate fairness and stability metrics, and address challenges such as missing data and complex dependency structures."}

As a result, many agentic search systems remain impractical despite their impressive performance. In this work, we introduce HotelQuEST, a benchmark comprising 214 hotel search queries that range from simple factual requests to complex queries, enabling evaluation across the full spectrum of query difficulty. We further address the challenge of evaluating underspecified user preferences by collecting clarifications that make annotators' implicit preferences explicit for evaluation. We find that LLM-based agents achieve higher accuracy than traditional retrievers, but at substantially higher costs due to redundant tool calls and suboptimal routing that fails to match query complexity to model capability.

Our universal clustering theorem shows that any $K$ closed classes can be approximated to arbitrary precision by NO-parameterized classes in the upper Kuratowski topology on closed sets, a notion that can be interpreted as disallowing false-positive misclassifications.\n  Building on this, we develop an NO-powered clustering pipeline for functional data and apply it to unlabeled families of ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectories. Discretized trajectories are lifted by a fixed pre-trained encoder into a continuous feature map and mapped to soft assignments by a lightweight trainable head.

Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale.

Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for assessing and advancing the realistic logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that our synthetic data-based reasoning tasks introduce non-trivial reasoning challenges and provide meaningful support for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification.

The present paper describes the Auton Agentic AI Framework, a principled architecture for standardizing the creation, execution, and governance of autonomous agent systems. The framework is organized around a strict separation between the Cognitive Blueprint, a declarative, language-agnostic specification of agent identity and capabilities, and the Runtime Engine, the platform-specific execution substrate that instantiates and runs the agent. This separation enables cross-language portability, formal auditability, and modular tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Consequently, any static prefetching method will miss crucial opportunities to adapt to different dynamic conditions. In this paper, we introduce Rudder, a software module embedded in the state-of-the-art AWS DistDGL framework, to autonomously prefetch remote nodes and minimize communication. Rudder's adaptation contrasts with both standard heuristics and traditional ML classifiers.

These challenges are particularly severe in sequential recommendation, where temporal dynamics further complicate signal aggregation. To address this problem, we propose a robust aggregation framework tailored for federated sequential recommendation under sparse and adversarial conditions. Instead of relying on standard averaging, our method introduces a defence-aware aggregation mechanism that identifies and down-weights unreliable client updates while preserving informative signals from sparse but benign participants. The framework incorporates representation-level constraints to stabilise user and item embeddings, preventing poisoned or anomalous contributions from dominating the global parameter space.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks."}

We find that there exist instances where learners who use existing algorithms almost surely converge to models with arbitrarily poor global performance, even when models with low full-population loss exist. This happens through a feedback-induced mechanism, which we call the overspecialization trap: as learners optimize for users who already prefer them, they become less attractive to users outside this base, which further restricts the data they observe. Inspired by the recent use of knowledge distillation in modern ML, we propose an algorithm that allows learners to \"probe\" the predictions of peer models, enabling them to learn about users who do not select them. Our analysis characterizes when probing succeeds: this procedure converges almost surely to a stationary point with bounded full-population risk when probing sources are sufficiently informative, e.g., a known market leader or a majority of peers with good global performance.

Rather than conducting a live crawl, all page content was sourced from Common Crawl's open WARC archives, ensuring reproducibility and eliminating any load on target web servers. Our static CSS analysis of 240 homepages identified 4,327 unique foreground/background colour pairings, of which 1,771 (40.9%) failed to meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio threshold for normal text. The median per-site pass rate was 62.7%, with 20.4% of sites achieving full compliance across all detected colour pairings. These findings suggest that colour contrast remains a widespread accessibility barrier on the most prominent websites, with significant variation across domain categories."}

The framework first uses a pretrained language model to encode the input text and obtain basic semantic representations. It then introduces structured prompts composed of multi-dimensional semantic factors and integrates them with text features through a learnable combination mechanism, which forms task-related representations with clear boundaries in the latent space. To further strengthen the consistency between text representations and label semantics, the method constructs a structured label embedding matrix and employs a cross-space alignment mechanism to ensure stable matching between textual features and label attributes. In addition, the model applies prompt orthogonality constraints and a joint optimization objective to maintain independence across different semantic factors in the prompts, allowing the structured prompts to provide transparent and controllable guidance for classification decisions. Three types of sensitivity experiments, including learning rate sensitivity, prompt length sensitivity, and data scale sensitivity, are designed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the framework under different conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed structured prompt optimization framework effectively alleviates semantic conflicts and label ambiguity in few-shot text classification. It significantly improves performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, and demonstrates strong cross-task applicability."}

While most DG methods focus on enforcing visual feature invariance, we leverage the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explore the potential of constructing reasoning chains that derives image categories to achieve more robust predictions under domain shift. To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling. Experiments on standard DomainBed datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc) demonstrate that RD-MLDG achieves state-of-the-art performances, highlighting reasoning as a promising complementary signal for robust out-of-domain generalization."}

To incorporate domain driven structural priors, we introduce graphettes, a new probabilistic family of graph structure models that generalize graphons via controlled structural edits for motifs like rings, stars and trees. We theoretically analyze the coupling, invariance, and structural properties of the proposed framework, and empirically evaluate it on synthetic and small-molecule graph generation tasks. Flowette demonstrates consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of combining structural priors with flow-based training for modeling complex graph distributions."}

Unlike autoregressive LLMs that generate one token per step based on all previous tokens, dLLMs theoretically enable parallel generation of multiple tokens at each decoding step. However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiCo can achieve significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive generation quality."}

To address these challenges, we propose Reflective Reinforcement Learning for Emotional Reasoning (EMO-R3), a framework designed to enhance the emotional reasoning ability of MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Structured Emotional Thinking to guide the model to perform step-by-step emotional reasoning in a structured and interpretable manner, and design a Reflective Emotional Reward that enables the model to re-evaluate its reasoning based on visual-text consistency and emotional coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-R3 significantly improves both the interpretability and emotional intelligence of MLLMs, achieving superior performance across multiple visual emotional understanding benchmarks."}

We construct a mixed, multi-domain Chinese professional writing dataset spanning current affairs, finance, law, and medicine. We then conduct a systematic study of LLM-based correction paradigms, from prompting to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. The analysis reveals practical challenges, including limited generalization of specialized correction models, the need for evidence grounding for factual repair, the difficulty of mixed-error paragraphs, and over-correction on clean inputs.

Specifically, we develop a pessimistic auxiliary strategy by maximizing the lower confidence bound of the Q-function. The pessimistic auxiliary strategy exhibits a relatively high value and low uncertainty in the vicinity of the learned policy, avoiding the learned policy sampling high-value actions with potentially high errors during the learning process. Less approximation error introduced by sampled action from pessimistic auxiliary strategy leads to the alleviation of error accumulation.

A Benchmark on EHR and Chest X-Ray Fusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning holds promise for advancing clinical decision support, yet it remains unclear when multimodal learning truly helps in practice, particularly under modality missingness and fairness constraints. In this work, we conduct a systematic benchmark of multimodal fusion between Electronic Health Records (EHR) and chest X-rays (CXR) on standardized cohorts from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR, aiming to answer four fundamental questions: when multimodal fusion improves clinical prediction, how different fusion strategies compare, how robust existing methods are to missing modalities, and whether multimodal models achieve algorithmic fairness. Our study reveals several key insights. Multimodal fusion improves performance when modalities are complete, with gains concentrating in diseases that require complementary information from both EHR and CXR. While cross-modal learning mechanisms capture clinically meaningful dependencies beyond simple concatenation, the rich temporal structure of EHR introduces strong modality imbalance that architectural complexity alone cannot overcome. Under realistic missingness, multimodal benefits rapidly degrade unless models are explicitly designed to handle incomplete inputs. Moreover, multimodal fusion does not inherently improve fairness, with subgroup disparities mainly arising from unequal sensitivity across demographic groups. To support reproducible and extensible evaluation, we further release a flexible benchmarking toolkit that enables plug-and-play integration of new models and datasets. Together, this work provides actionable guidance on when multimodal learning helps, when it fails, and why, laying the foundation for developing clinically deployable multimodal systems that are both effective and reliable.

As the organizers of the DRAGUN track, we describe the resources that we have newly developed to allow for the reuse of the track's tasks. The track had two tasks: (Task 1) Question Generation, producing 10 ranked investigative questions; and (Task 2, the main task) Report Generation, producing a 250-word report grounded in the MS MARCO V2.1 Segmented Corpus. As part of the track's evaluation, we had TREC assessors create importance-weighted rubrics of questions with expected short answers for 30 different news articles. These rubrics represent the information that assessors believe is important for readers to assess an article's trustworthiness. The assessors then used their rubrics to manually judge the participating teams' submitted runs. To make these tasks and their rubrics reusable, we have created an automated process to judge runs not part of the original assessing. We show that our AutoJudge ranks existing runs well compared to the TREC human-assessed evaluation (Kendall's $τ= 0.678$ for Task 1 and $τ= 0.872$ for Task 2).

Most of the existing automated HPO methods are accuracy-based, i.e., accuracy metrics are used to guide the trials of different hyperparameter configurations amongst a specific search space. However, many trials may encounter severe training problems, such as vanishing gradients and insufficient convergence, which can hardly be reflected by accuracy metrics in the early stages of the training and often result in poor performance. This leads to an inefficient optimization trajectory because the bad trials occupy considerable computation resources and reduce the probability of finding excellent hyperparameter configurations within a time limitation. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Bad Trial Tackler (BTTackler)}, a novel HPO framework that introduces training diagnosis to identify training problems automatically and hence tackles bad trials. BTTackler diagnoses each trial by calculating a set of carefully designed quantified indicators and triggers early termination if any training problems are detected. Evaluations are performed on representative HPO tasks consisting of three classical deep neural networks (DNN) and four widely used HPO methods. To better quantify the effectiveness of an automated HPO method, we propose two new measurements based on accuracy and time consumption. Results show the advantage of BTTackler on two-fold: (1) it reduces 40.33\\% of time consumption to achieve the same accuracy comparable to baseline methods on average and (2) it conducts 44.5\\% more top-10 trials than baseline methods on average within a given time budget. We also released an open-source Python library that allows users to easily apply BTTackler to automated HPO processes with minimal code changes."}

To improve retrieval of coordinates from similar digitized early modern texts, we have created a gold standard dataset, trained models, published the resulting inferred and normalized coordinate data, and experimented applying these models to new texts. From 74,000 total articles in each of the digitized versions of the Encyclopedie from ARTFL and ENCCRE, we examined 15,278 geographical entries, manually identifying 4,798 containing coordinates, and 10,480 with descriptive but non-numerical references. Leveraging our gold standard annotations, we trained transformer-based models to retrieve and normalize coordinates. The pipeline presented here combines a classifier to identify coordinate-bearing entries and a second model for retrieval, tested across encoder-decoder and decoder architectures. Cross-validation yielded an 86% EM score. On an out-of-domain eighteenth-century Trevoux dictionary (also in French), our fine-tuned model had a 61% EM score, while for the nineteenth-century, 7th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in English, the EM was 77%.

Despite the practical prevalence of single-loop algorithms--which update lower and upper variables concurrently--their theoretical understanding, particularly in the stochastic regime, remains significantly underdeveloped compared to their multi-loop counterparts. Existing analyses often yield suboptimal convergence rates or obscure the critical dependence on the lower-level condition number $κ$, frequently burying it within generic Lipschitz constants. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a refined convergence analysis of the Single-loop Stochastic Approximate Implicit Differentiation (SSAID) algorithm. We prove that SSAID achieves an $ε$-stationary point with an oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(κ^7 ε^{-2})$. Our result is noteworthy in two aspects: (i) it matches the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ rate of state-of-the-art multi-loop methods (e.g., stocBiO) while maintaining the computational efficiency of a single-loop update; and (ii) it provides the first explicit, fine-grained characterization of the $κ$-dependence for stochastic AID-based single-loop methods. This work demonstrates that SSAID is not merely a heuristic approach, but admits a rigorous theoretical foundation with convergence guarantees competitive with mainstream multi-loop frameworks."}

Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

For modern speech-to-speech (S2S) systems, a critical yet unanswered question is whether they can converse like humans. To tackle this, we conduct the first Turing test for S2S systems, collecting 2,968 human judgments on dialogues between 9 state-of-the-art S2S systems and 28 human participants. Our results deliver a clear finding: no existing evaluated S2S system passes the test, revealing a significant gap in human-likeness. To diagnose this failure, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy of 18 human-likeness dimensions and crowd-annotate our collected dialogues accordingly. Our analysis shows that the bottleneck is not semantic understanding but stems from paralinguistic features, emotional expressivity, and conversational persona. Furthermore, we find that off-the-shelf AI models perform unreliably as Turing test judges. In response, we propose an interpretable model that leverages the fine-grained human-likeness ratings and delivers accurate and transparent human-vs-machine discrimination, offering a powerful tool for automatic human-likeness evaluation.

Most existing guardrail models formulate moderation as a fixed binary classification task, implicitly assuming a fixed definition of harmfulness. In practice, enforcement strictness - how conservatively harmfulness is defined and enforced - varies across platforms and evolves over time, making binary moderators brittle under shifting requirements. We first introduce FlexBench, a strictness-adaptive LLM moderation benchmark that enables controlled evaluation under multiple strictness regimes. Experiments on FlexBench reveal substantial cross-strictness inconsistency in existing moderators: models that perform well under one regime can degrade substantially under others, limiting their practical usability. To address this, we propose FlexGuard, an LLM-based moderator that outputs a calibrated continuous risk score reflecting risk severity and supports strictness-specific decisions via thresholding. We train FlexGuard via risk-alignment optimization to improve score-severity consistency and provide practical threshold selection strategies to adapt to target strictness at deployment. Experiments on FlexBench and public benchmarks demonstrate that FlexGuard achieves higher moderation accuracy and substantially improved robustness under varying strictness.

At the upper level, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent strategically partitions the road network into manageable clusters and optimally allocates resources from multiple depots. At the lower level, a multi-objective vehicle routing problem (VRP) is solved within each cluster, minimizing the maximum vehicle travel time and total carbon emissions. Unlike existing approaches, our method handles large-scale, real-world networks efficiently, explicitly incorporating vehicle-specific constraints, depot capacities, and road segment requirements. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including balanced workloads, reduced maximum travel times below the targeted two-hour threshold, lower emissions, and substantial cost savings.

In practice, however, a discrepancy between the factor-wise averaging used to preserve low rank and the mathematically correct aggregation of local updates can cause significant aggregation error and unstable training. We argue that a major source of this problem is rotational misalignment, arising from the rotational invariance of low-rank factorizations -- semantically equivalent updates can be represented in different latent subspaces across clients since $(B_i R_i)(R_i^\\top A_i) = B_i A_i$. When such misaligned factors are averaged directly, they interfere destructively and degrade the global update. To address this issue, we propose FedRot-LoRA, a federated LoRA framework that aligns client updates via orthogonal transformations prior to aggregation. This alignment preserves the semantic update while reducing cross-client subspace mismatch, without increasing communication cost or restricting model expressivity. We provide a convergence analysis that examines the aggregation error induced by factor-wise averaging and shows how rotational alignment yields a tighter upper bound on this error. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrate that FedRot-LoRA consistently outperforms existing federated LoRA baselines across a range of heterogeneity levels and LoRA ranks."}

Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models."}

Diffusion models have recently attracted attention due to their advanced generative capabilities. Existing diffusion-based methods for TSAD rely on a conditional strategy, which reconstructs input instances from white noise with the aid of the conditioner. However, this poses challenges in accurately reconstructing the normal parts, resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In response, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, named AnomalyFilter, which acts as a selective filter that only denoises anomaly parts in the instance while retaining normal parts. To build such a filter, we mask Gaussian noise during the training phase and conduct the denoising process without adding noise to the instances. The synergy of the two simple components greatly enhances the performance of naive diffusion models. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that AnomalyFilter achieves notably low reconstruction error on normal parts, providing empirical support for its effectiveness in anomaly detection. AnomalyFilter represents a pioneering approach that focuses on the noise design of diffusion models specifically tailored for TSAD."}

However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space.

Learning representations of a TTS benefits various applications, but it is also challenging since the complexities inherent in the tensor hinder the realization of rich representations. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method designed specifically for TTS, namely MoST. Specifically, MoST uses a tensor slicing approach to reduce the complexity of the TTS structure and learns representations that can be disentangled into individual non-temporal modes. Each representation captures mode-specific features, which are the relationship between variables within the same mode, and mode-invariant features, which are in common in representations of different modes. We employ a contrastive learning framework to learn parameters; the loss function comprises two parts intended to learn representation in a mode-specific way and mode-invariant way, effectively exploiting disentangled representations as augmentations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that MoST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification and forecasting accuracy.

Automatically recovering geographic coordinates from historical texts is a complex task, as they are expressed in a variety of ways and with varying levels of precision. To improve retrieval of coordinates from similar digitized early modern texts, we have created a gold standard dataset, trained models, published the resulting inferred and normalized coordinate data, and experimented applying these models to new texts. From 74,000 total articles in each of the digitized versions of the Encyclopedie from ARTFL and ENCCRE, we examined 15,278 geographical entries, manually identifying 4,798 containing coordinates, and 10,480 with descriptive but non-numerical references. Leveraging our gold standard annotations, we trained transformer-based models to retrieve and normalize coordinates. The pipeline presented here combines a classifier to identify coordinate-bearing entries and a second model for retrieval, tested across encoder-decoder and decoder architectures. Cross-validation yielded an 86% EM score. On an out-of-domain eighteenth-century Trevoux dictionary (also in French), our fine-tuned model had a 61% EM score, while for the nineteenth-century, 7th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in English, the EM was 77%. These findings highlight the gold standard dataset's usefulness as training data, and our two-step method's cross-lingual, cross-domain generalizability."}

Preference packing improves resource efficiency by reducing the attention operations for duplicate input prompts and decreasing KV cache memory usage.

Using uncentered, row-normalized trajectory PCA, we show that a single direction captures a large fraction of cumulative parameter movement early in training, while remaining components encode oscillatory behavior in auxiliary probe performance. Instantaneous gradients exhibit little alignment with this dominant direction, indicating that it arises from accumulated optimizer updates rather than per-batch gradient structure. Comparing AdamW with SGD variants at matched loss levels reveals substantial differences in trajectory geometry: AdamW develops multi-dimensional drift structure, whereas SGD-family optimizers produce nearly colinear parameter evolution and weaker probe dynamics. Reheating selectively perturbs transverse components with minimal effect on the dominant drift coordinate. These findings suggest that optimizer choice shapes the effective dimensionality and structure of learning trajectories beyond what is apparent from loss values alone."}

To this end, we study an extended problem that is closer to practical scenarios--the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Limited Buffers and Material Kitting. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in scheduling tasks. However, its capacity for state modeling remains limited when handling complex dependencies and long-term constraints. To address this, we leverage a heterogeneous graph network within the DRL framework to model the global state. By constructing efficient message passing among machines, operations, and buffers, the network focuses on avoiding decisions that may cause frequent pallet changes during long-sequence scheduling, thereby helping improve buffer utilization and overall decision quality. Experimental results on both synthetic and real production line datasets show that the proposed method outperforms traditional heuristics and advanced DRL methods in terms of makespan and pallet changes, and also achieves a good balance between solution quality and computational cost. Furthermore, a supplementary video is provided to showcase a simulation system that effectively visualizes the progression of the production line."}

Moreover, we introduce a reward modulation mechanism that estimates rewards based on state transitions, applying to DSB-aligned samples to ensure consistency between rewards and target-domain dynamics. BDGxRL performs target-oriented policy learning entirely within the source domain, without access to the target environment or its rewards.

We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages."}

We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings.

This work represents the first attempt to employ LLMs in the field of optical design. We bridge the expertise gap by enabling users without formal optical training to successfully develop functional lens systems. Concretely, we curate a comprehensive dataset, named OptiDesignQA, which encompasses both classical lens systems sourced from standard optical textbooks and novel configurations generated by automated design algorithms for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we inject domain-specific optical expertise into the LLM through a hybrid objective of full-system synthesis and lens completion.

This reward system incorporates structural format rewards, physical feasibility rewards, light-manipulation accuracy, and LLM-based heuristics. Finally, our model integrates with specialized optical optimization routines for end-to-end fine-tuning and precision refinement.

While effective, these methods often overlook the multi-scale temporal structure inherent in trajectories, resulting in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAGE, a Multi-scale Autoregressive GEneration-based offline RL method. MAGE incorporates a condition-guided multi-scale autoencoder to learn hierarchical trajectory representations, along with a multi-scale transformer that autoregressively generates trajectory representations from coarse to fine temporal scales. MAGE effectively captures temporal dependencies of trajectories at multiple resolutions. Additionally, a condition-guided decoder is employed to exert precise control over short-term behaviors. Extensive experiments on five offline RL benchmarks against fifteen baseline algorithms show that MAGE successfully integrates multi-scale trajectory modeling with conditional guidance, generating coherent and controllable trajectories in long-horizon sparse-reward settings."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation.

We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models.

Recent studies have shown that informed heuristics that take the positions/shapes of the obstacles into account can be approximated with the deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the existing learning-based approaches mostly rely on the assumption that training and test grid maps are drawn from the same distribution (e.g., city maps, indoor maps, etc.) and perform poorly on out-of-distribution tasks. This naturally limits their application in practice when often a universal solver is needed that is capable of efficiently handling any problem instance. In this work, we close this gap by designing an universal heuristic predictor: a model trained once, but capable of generalizing across a full spectrum of unseen tasks. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the suggested approach halves the computational effort of A* by up to a factor of 2.2, while still providing solutions within 3% of the optimal cost on average altogether on the tasks that are completely different from the ones used for training $\\unicode{x2013}$ a milestone reached for the first time by a learnable solver."}

However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

However, under aggressive compression, the resulting accuracy degradation often necessitates post-compression finetuning, which can be impractical due to missing labeled data or high training cost. We propose post-hoc blockwise compensation, called GRAIL, a simple zero-finetuning step applied after model compression that restores each block's input-output behavior using a small calibration set. The method summarizes hidden activations via a Gram matrix and applies ridge regression to linearly reconstruct the original hidden representation from the reduced one. The resulting reconstruction map is absorbed into the downstream projection weights, while the upstream layer is compressed. The approach is selector-agnostic (Magnitude, Wanda, Gram-based selection, or folding), data-aware (requiring only a few forward passes without gradients or labels), and recovers classic pruning or folding when the Gram matrix is near identity, indicating weak inter-channel correlations. Across ResNets, ViTs, and decoder-only LLMs, GRAIL consistently improves accuracy or perplexity over data-free and data-aware pruning or folding baselines in practical compression regimes, with manageable overhead and no backpropagation.

In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption."}

Moreover, these algorithms rely on state-wise mirror descent and require actors to be implicitly induced from the critic functions, failing to accommodate standalone policy parameterization which is ubiquitous in practice. In this work, we address these limitations and extend the theoretical guarantees to parameterized policy classes over large or continuous action spaces. When extending mirror descent to parameterized policies, we identify contextual coupling as the core difficulty, and show how connecting mirror descent to natural policy gradient leads to novel analyses, guarantees, and algorithmic insights, including a surprising unification between offline RL and imitation learning."}

For unary fixed-frequency encodings, circuit depth scales as O(omega_max * (omega_max + epsilon^{-2})) with target frequency magnitude omega_max and precision epsilon. Trainable-frequency approaches theoretically reduce this to match the target spectrum size, requiring only as many encoding gates as frequencies in the target spectrum. Despite this compelling efficiency, their practical effectiveness hinges on a key assumption: that gradient-based optimization can drive prefactors to arbitrary target values. We demonstrate through systematic experiments that frequency prefactors exhibit limited trainability: movement is constrained to approximately +/-1 units with typical learning rates. When target frequencies lie outside this reachable range, optimization frequently fails. To overcome this frequency reachability limitation, we propose grid-based initialization using ternary encodings, which generate dense integer frequency spectra. While this approach requires O(log_3(omega_max)) encoding gates -- more than the theoretical optimum but exponentially fewer than fixed-frequency methods -- it ensures target frequencies lie within the locally reachable range.

We detail the technical implementation of key innovations, including the Higress-Native Splitter for structure-aware data ingestion, the application of Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for merging dense and sparse retrieval signals, and a 50ms-latency Semantic Caching mechanism with dynamic thresholding. Experimental evaluations on domain-specific Higress technical documentation and blogs verify the system's architectural robustness. The results demonstrate that by optimizing the entire retrieval lifecycle - from pre-retrieval query rewriting to post-retrieval corrective evaluation - the Higress RAG system offers a scalable, hallucination-resistant solution for enterprise AI deployment."}

However, most existing models are limited to a single functional modality, restricting their ability to exploit complementary spatiotemporal dynamics and the collective data scale across imaging techniques. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-OF, the first omnifunctional brain foundation model jointly pretrained on fMRI, EEG and MEG, capable of handling both unimodal and multimodal inputs within a unified framework. To reconcile heterogeneous spatiotemporal resolutions, we introduce the Any-Resolution Neural Signal Sampler, which projects diverse brain signals into a shared semantic space.To further manage semantic shifts, the Brain-OF backbone integrates DINT attention with a Sparse Mixture of Experts, where shared experts capture modality-invariant representations and routed experts specialize in modality-specific semantics. Furthermore, we propose Masked Temporal-Frequency Modeling, a dual-domain pretraining objective that jointly reconstructs brain signals in both the time and frequency domains. Brain-OF is pretrained on a large-scale corpus comprising around 40 datasets and demonstrates superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting the benefits of joint multimodal integration and dual-domain pretraining."}

Popular FL algorithms integrate sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into local training to address this issue. However, in the high data heterogeneity setting, the flatness in local training does not imply the flatness of the global model. Therefore, minimizing the sharpness of the local loss surfaces on the client data does not enable the effectiveness of SAM in FL to improve the generalization ability of the global model. We define the \\textbf{flatness distance} to explain this phenomenon. By rethinking the SAM in FL and theoretically analyzing the \\textbf{flatness distance}, we propose a novel \\textbf{FedNSAM} algorithm that accelerates the SAM algorithm by introducing global Nesterov momentum into the local update to harmonize the consistency of global and local flatness. \\textbf{FedNSAM} uses the global Nesterov momentum as the direction of local estimation of client global perturbations and extrapolation. Theoretically, we prove a tighter convergence bound than FedSAM by Nesterov extrapolation. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments on CNN and Transformer models to verify the superior performance and efficiency of \\textbf{FedNSAM}.

In this paradigm, previously evaluated solutions are reused to guide the model toward new candidate solutions. Crucially, the effectiveness of this evolution process depends on the search strategy: how prior solutions are selected and varied to generate new candidates. However, most existing methods rely on fixed search strategies with predefined knobs (e.g., explore-exploit ratios) that remain static throughout execution. While effective in some settings, these approaches often fail to adapt across tasks, or even within the same task as the search space changes over time. We introduce EvoX, an adaptive evolution method that optimizes its own evolution process. EvoX jointly evolves candidate solutions and the search strategies used to generate them, continuously updating how prior solutions are selected and varied based on progress. This enables the system to dynamically shift between different search strategies during the optimization process. Across nearly 200 real-world optimization tasks, EvoX outperforms existing AI-driven evolutionary methods including AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve on the majority of tasks."}

We argue that these limitations reflect structural properties of the supervision channel rather than model scale or optimization. We develop a unified theory showing that whenever the human supervision channel is not sufficient for a latent evaluation target, it acts as an information-reducing channel that induces a strictly positive excess-risk floor for any learner dominated by it. We formalize this Human-Bounded Intelligence limit and show that across six complementary frameworks (operator theory, PAC-Bayes, information theory, causal inference, category theory, and game-theoretic analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback), non-sufficiency yields strictly positive lower bounds arising from the same structural decomposition into annotation noise, preference distortion, and semantic compression. The theory explains why scaling alone cannot eliminate persistent human-aligned errors and characterizes conditions under which auxiliary non-human signals (e.g., retrieval, program execution, tools) increase effective supervision capacity and collapse the floor by restoring information about the latent target. Experiments on real preference data, synthetic known-target tasks, and externally verifiable benchmarks confirm the predicted structural signatures: human-only supervision exhibits a persistent floor, while sufficiently informative auxiliary channels strictly reduce or eliminate excess error."}

Clustered FL tackles this by grouping similar clients. However, existing clustered FL approaches rely solely on either data similarity or gradient similarity; however, this results in an incomplete assessment of client similarities. Prior clustered FL approaches also restrict knowledge and representation sharing to clients within the same cluster. This prevents cluster models from benefiting from the diverse client population across clusters. To address these limitations, FedDAG introduces a clustered FL framework, FedDAG, that employs a weighted, class-wise similarity metric that integrates both data and gradient information, providing a more holistic measure of similarity during clustering. In addition, FedDAG adopts a dual-encoder architecture for cluster models, comprising a primary encoder trained on its own clients' data and a secondary encoder refined using gradients from complementary clusters. This enables cross-cluster feature transfer while preserving cluster-specific specialization. Experiments on diverse benchmarks and data heterogeneity settings show that FedDAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustered FL baselines in accuracy."}

The non-Euclidean nature of graphs and specialized architectures for graph learning further complicate a fine-grained analysis of graph distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a theory that assumes RGM as the data generative process, exploiting its connection to hypothesis complexity in function space perspective for such fine-grained analysis. Building on a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS) formulation, we derive a generalization bound whose shift penalty admits a factorization into (i) a domain discrepancy term, (ii) a spectral-geometry term summarized by the accessible truncated spectrum, and (iii) an amplitude term that aggregates convergence and construction-stability effects.

Yet most approaches rely on pointwise reward estimates that overlook the epistemic uncertainty in reward models arising from limited human feedback. Recent work suggests that quantifying this uncertainty can reduce the costs of human annotation via uncertainty-guided active learning and mitigate reward overoptimization in LLM post-training. However, uncertainty-aware reward models have so far been adopted without thorough comparison, leaving them poorly understood. This work introduces a unified framework, RewardUQ, to systematically evaluate uncertainty quantification for reward models. We compare common methods along standard metrics measuring accuracy and calibration, and we propose a new ranking strategy incorporating both dimensions for a simplified comparison. Our experimental results suggest that model size and initialization have the most meaningful impact on performance, and most prior work could have benefited from alternative design choices.

While reasoning LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on logical and mathematical tasks, their behavior on such open-ended, non-deterministic inferences remains largely unexplored. We introduce ProbCOPA, a dataset of 210 handcrafted probabilistic inferences in English, each annotated for inference likelihood by 25--30 human participants. We find that human responses are graded and varied, revealing probabilistic judgments of the inferences in our dataset. Comparing these judgments with responses from eight state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, we show that models consistently fail to produce human-like distributions. Finally, analyzing LLM reasoning chains, we find evidence of a common reasoning pattern used to evaluate such inferences. Our findings reveal persistent differences between humans and LLMs, and underscore the need to evaluate reasoning beyond deterministic settings."}

However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results, achieving an average accuracy of 46.6% on math reasoning and exhibiting robust generalization with 53.4% accuracy on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks."}

Consequently, any static prefetching method will miss crucial opportunities to adapt to different dynamic conditions. In this paper, we introduce Rudder, a software module embedded in the state-of-the-art AWS DistDGL framework, to autonomously prefetch remote nodes and minimize communication. Rudder's adaptation contrasts with both standard heuristics and traditional ML classifiers. We observe that the generative AI found in contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibits emergent properties like In-Context Learning (ICL) for zero-shot tasks, with logical multi-step reasoning. We find this behavior well-suited for adaptive control even with substantial undertraining. Evaluations using standard datasets and unseen configurations on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer show up to 91% improvement in end-to-end training performance over baseline DistDGL (no prefetching), and an 82% improvement over static prefetching, reducing communication by over 50%.

In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Concept Embedding Models (HiCEMs), a new family of CEMs that explicitly model concept relationships through hierarchical structures. To enable HiCEMs in real-world settings, we propose Concept Splitting, a method for automatically discovering finer-grained sub-concepts from a pretrained CEM's embedding space without requiring additional annotations. This allows HiCEMs to generate fine-grained explanations from limited concept labels, reducing annotation burdens. Our evaluation across multiple datasets, including a user study and experiments on PseudoKitchens, a newly proposed concept-based dataset of 3D kitchen renders, demonstrates that (1) Concept Splitting discovers human-interpretable sub-concepts absent during training that can be used to train highly accurate HiCEMs, and (2) HiCEMs enable powerful test-time concept interventions at different granularities, leading to improved task accuracy."}

UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence.

There exist some recent learning based approaches to this problem, but its formulation from the perspective of variational inference remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a variational inference framework for learning parallel generation orders for MDMs. As part of our method, we propose a parameterisation for the approximate posterior of generation orders which facilitates parallelism and efficient sampling during training. Using this method, we conduct preliminary experiments on the GSM8K dataset, where our method performs competitively against heuristic sampling strategies in the regime of highly parallel generation. For example, our method achieves 33.1\\% accuracy with an average of only only 4 generation steps, compared to 23.7-29.0\\% accuracy achieved by standard competitor methods in the same number of steps.

However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by \"pasting\" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments."}

At its core, the network introduces a novel \\emph{point-to-hyperplane} fully connected layer (FC), replacing traditional Euclidean affine logits with closed-form hyperbolic distances from features to learned Lorentz hyperplanes, thereby ensuring that the resulting geometric decision functions respect the inherent curvature. Around this fundamental layer, we design intrinsic modules: GyroLBN, a Lorentz batch normalization that couples gyro-centering with gyro-scaling, consistently outperforming both LBN and GyroBN while reducing training time.

There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data."}

Neuroimaging modalities, such as structural MRI, provide biomarkers of this transition; however, their high costs and infrastructure needs limit their deployment at a population scale. Speech analysis offers a non-invasive alternative, but speech-only classifiers are developed independently of neuroimaging, leaving decision boundaries biologically ungrounded and limiting reliability on the subtle CN-versus-MCI distinction. We propose MINT (Multimodal Imaging-to-Speech Knowledge Transfer), a three-stage cross-modal framework that transfers biomarker structure from MRI into a speech encoder at training time. An MRI teacher, trained on 1,228 subjects, defines a compact neuroimaging embedding space for CN-versus-MCI classification. A residual projection head aligns speech representations to this frozen imaging manifold via a combined geometric loss, adapting speech to the learned biomarker space while preserving imaging encoder fidelity. The frozen MRI classifier, which is never exposed to speech, is applied to aligned embeddings at inference and requires no scanner. Evaluation on ADNI-4 shows aligned speech achieves performance comparable to speech-only baselines (AUC 0.720 vs 0.711) while requiring no imaging at inference, demonstrating that MRI-derived decision boundaries can ground speech representations. Multimodal fusion improves over MRI alone (0.973 vs 0.958). Ablation studies identify dropout regularization and self-supervised pretraining as critical design decisions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of MRI-to-speech knowledge transfer for early Alzheimer's screening, establishing a biologically grounded pathway for population-level cognitive triage without neuroimaging at inference."}

We propose an agenda built around four components: (i) learnable reward models from specifications to support optimization with clear objectives; (ii) adaptive formal verification integrated throughout learning; (iii) online abstraction calibration to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions; and (iv) test-time synthesis and world-model generation guided by verifiers.

However, existing benchmarks do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning in practical contexts. Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for assessing and advancing the realistic logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that our synthetic data-based reasoning tasks introduce non-trivial reasoning challenges and provide meaningful support for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

First, we show that under certain alignment and concentration assumptions, projections of the high-dimensional representation asymptotically approach a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Next, under less strict assumptions, we show that adding a small asymptotically vanishing regularization term that promotes low feature norm and high feature entropy leads to similar asymptotic results. We support our analysis with experiments on synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets across multiple encoder architectures and sizes, demonstrating consistent Gaussian behavior. This perspective provides a principled explanation for commonly observed Gaussianity in contrastive representations. The resulting Gaussian model enables principled analytical treatment of learned representations and is expected to support a wide range of applications in contrastive learning."}

A Benchmark on EHR and Chest X-Ray Fusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning holds promise for advancing clinical decision support, yet it remains unclear when multimodal learning truly helps in practice, particularly under modality missingness and fairness constraints. In this work, we conduct a systematic benchmark of multimodal fusion between Electronic Health Records (EHR) and chest X-rays (CXR) on standardized cohorts from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR, aiming to answer four fundamental questions: when multimodal fusion improves clinical prediction, how different fusion strategies compare, how robust existing methods are to missing modalities, and whether multimodal models achieve algorithmic fairness. Our study reveals several key insights. Multimodal fusion improves performance when modalities are complete, with gains concentrating in diseases that require complementary information from both EHR and CXR. While cross-modal learning mechanisms capture clinically meaningful dependencies beyond simple concatenation, the rich temporal structure of EHR introduces strong modality imbalance that architectural complexity alone cannot overcome. Under realistic missingness, multimodal benefits rapidly degrade unless models are explicitly designed to handle incomplete inputs. Moreover, multimodal fusion does not inherently improve fairness, with subgroup disparities mainly arising from unequal sensitivity across demographic groups. To support reproducible and extensible evaluation, we further release a flexible benchmarking toolkit that enables plug-and-play integration of new models and datasets. Together, this work provides actionable guidance on when multimodal learning helps, when it fails, and why, laying the foundation for developing clinically deployable multimodal systems that are both effective and reliable.

However, uncertainty-aware reward models have so far been adopted without thorough comparison, leaving them poorly understood. This work introduces a unified framework, RewardUQ, to systematically evaluate uncertainty quantification for reward models. We compare common methods along standard metrics measuring accuracy and calibration, and we propose a new ranking strategy incorporating both dimensions for a simplified comparison. Our experimental results suggest that model size and initialization have the most meaningful impact on performance, and most prior work could have benefited from alternative design choices.

Most existing guardrail models formulate moderation as a fixed binary classification task, implicitly assuming a fixed definition of harmfulness. In practice, enforcement strictness - how conservatively harmfulness is defined and enforced - varies across platforms and evolves over time, making binary moderators brittle under shifting requirements. We first introduce FlexBench, a strictness-adaptive LLM moderation benchmark that enables controlled evaluation under multiple strictness regimes. Experiments on FlexBench reveal substantial cross-strictness inconsistency in existing moderators: models that perform well under one regime can degrade substantially under others, limiting their practical usability. To address this, we propose FlexGuard, an LLM-based moderator that outputs a calibrated continuous risk score reflecting risk severity and supports strictness-specific decisions via thresholding. We train FlexGuard via risk-alignment optimization to improve score-severity consistency and provide practical threshold selection strategies to adapt to target strictness at deployment. Experiments on FlexBench and public benchmarks demonstrate that FlexGuard achieves higher moderation accuracy and substantially improved robustness under varying strictness.

By using CUDA kernels to update signature coefficients in parallel over prefix-closed word sets, pathsig achieves high GPU throughput and near-minimal peak memory. Compared with other libraries, pathsig achieves 10-30x speedups for computation of truncated signatures and up to 4-10x speedups in training that require backpropagation through the signature. Beyond regular truncation, pathsig supports projections of the (infinite-dimensional) signature onto user-specified sets of words and anisotropic truncation motivated by inhomogeneous path regularity, enabling more compact representations that can reduce dimensionality, redundancy, and computational cost."}

In practice, however, a discrepancy between the factor-wise averaging used to preserve low rank and the mathematically correct aggregation of local updates can cause significant aggregation error and unstable training. We argue that a major source of this problem is rotational misalignment, arising from the rotational invariance of low-rank factorizations -- semantically equivalent updates can be represented in different latent subspaces across clients since $(B_i R_i)(R_i^\\top A_i) = B_i A_i$. When such misaligned factors are averaged directly, they interfere destructively and degrade the global update. To address this issue, we propose FedRot-LoRA, a federated LoRA framework that aligns client updates via orthogonal transformations prior to aggregation. This alignment preserves the semantic update while reducing cross-client subspace mismatch, without increasing communication cost or restricting model expressivity. We provide a convergence analysis that examines the aggregation error induced by factor-wise averaging and shows how rotational alignment yields a tighter upper bound on this error. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrate that FedRot-LoRA consistently outperforms existing federated LoRA baselines across a range of heterogeneity levels and LoRA ranks."}

However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification. Compared with the strongest baseline using prompt-enhanced GPT, TRIZ-RAGNER yields an absolute F1-score improvement of 7.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented TRIZ knowledge grounding for robust and accurate patent-based contradiction mining."}

Specifically, ACWI introduces a lightweight Beta Network that predicts the intrinsic reward weight directly from the agent state through an encoder based architecture. The scaling mechanism is optimized using a correlation based objective that encourages alignment between the weighted intrinsic rewards and discounted future extrinsic returns. This formulation enables task adaptive exploration incentives while preserving computational efficiency and training stability. We evaluate ACWI on a suite of sparse reward environments in MiniGrid.

Instantaneous gradients exhibit little alignment with this dominant direction, indicating that it arises from accumulated optimizer updates rather than per-batch gradient structure. Comparing AdamW with SGD variants at matched loss levels reveals substantial differences in trajectory geometry: AdamW develops multi-dimensional drift structure, whereas SGD-family optimizers produce nearly colinear parameter evolution and weaker probe dynamics. Reheating selectively perturbs transverse components with minimal effect on the dominant drift coordinate. These findings suggest that optimizer choice shapes the effective dimensionality and structure of learning trajectories beyond what is apparent from loss values alone."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems.

We introduce TradeFM, a 524M-parameter generative Transformer that brings this paradigm to market microstructure, learning directly from billions of trade events across >9K equities. To enable cross-asset generalization, we develop scale-invariant features and a universal tokenization scheme that map the heterogeneous, multi-modal event stream of order flow into a unified discrete sequence -- eliminating asset-specific calibration. Integrated with a deterministic market simulator, TradeFM-generated rollouts reproduce key stylized facts of financial returns, including heavy tails, volatility clustering, and absence of return autocorrelation. Quantitatively, TradeFM achieves 2-3x lower distributional error than Compound Hawkes baselines and generalizes zero-shot to geographically out-of-distribution APAC markets with moderate perplexity degradation. Together, these results suggest that scale-invariant trade representations capture transferable structure in market microstructure, opening a path toward synthetic data generation, stress testing, and learning-based trading agents."}

Most explainable AI techniques do not extend well to token sequences, where both local and global features matter, because state-of-the-art models, like transformers, tend to focus on global connections. Therefore, existing explainable AI algorithms fail by (i) identifying disparate tokens of importance, or (ii) assigning a large number of tokens a low value of importance. This method for explainable AI for tokens-based classifiers generalizes a mask-based explainable AI algorithm for images. It starts with an Explainer neural network that is trained to create masks to hide information not relevant for classification. Then, the Hadamard product of the mask and the continuous values of the classifier's embedding layer is taken and passed through the classifier, changing the magnitude of the embedding vector but keeping the orientation unchanged. The Explainer is trained for a taxonomic classifier for nucleotide sequences and it is shown that the masked segments are less relevant to classification than the unmasked ones. This method focused on the importance the token as a whole (i.e., a segment of the input sequence), producing a human-readable explanation."}

Recent studies have shown that informed heuristics that take the positions/shapes of the obstacles into account can be approximated with the deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the existing learning-based approaches mostly rely on the assumption that training and test grid maps are drawn from the same distribution (e.g., city maps, indoor maps, etc.) and perform poorly on out-of-distribution tasks. This naturally limits their application in practice when often a universal solver is needed that is capable of efficiently handling any problem instance. In this work, we close this gap by designing an universal heuristic predictor: a model trained once, but capable of generalizing across a full spectrum of unseen tasks. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the suggested approach halves the computational effort of A* by up to a factor of 2.2, while still providing solutions within 3% of the optimal cost on average altogether on the tasks that are completely different from the ones used for training $\\unicode{x2013}$ a milestone reached for the first time by a learnable solver."}

In this paper, we give a new method for constructing low-degree sandwiching polynomials that yield greatly improved degree bounds for several fundamental function classes and marginal distributions. In particular, we obtain degree $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ sandwiching polynomials for functions of $k$ halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution, improving exponentially over the prior $2^{O(k)}$ bound. More broadly, our approach applies to function classes that are low-dimensional and have smooth boundary.\n  In contrast to prior work, our proof is relatively simple and directly uses the smoothness of the target function's boundary to construct sandwiching Lipschitz functions, which are amenable to results from high-dimensional approximation theory. For low-dimensional polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) with respect to Gaussians, we obtain doubly exponential improvements without applying the FT-mollification method of Kane used in the best previous result."}

In Pre-Process, the server distributes multiple perturbed and reparameterized model instances, allowing the client to execute unlearning locally on its private forget set without accessing the server's exact original parameters. After local unlearning, the server performs Post-Process by inverting the reparameterization and aggregating updates with a harmonic denoising procedure to alleviate the impact of perturbation.

We formulate this problem as a large-scale Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) task with high-dimensional state spaces and dynamic system behavior. Our method builds on recent theoretical advances in solving constrained RL problems via best-response and no-regret dynamics in zero-sum games, enabling principled minimax policy learning. Policy evaluation on realistic warehouse simulations shows that our approach effectively trades off objectives, and we empirically observe that it learns a single policy that simultaneously satisfies all constraints, even if this is not theoretically guaranteed. We further introduce a theoretical framework to handle the problem of error cancellation, where time-averaged solutions display oscillatory behavior. This method returns a single iterate whose Lagrangian value is close to the minimax value of the game. These results demonstrate the promise of MORL in solving complex, high-impact decision-making problems in large-scale industrial systems."}

Moreover, these algorithms rely on state-wise mirror descent and require actors to be implicitly induced from the critic functions, failing to accommodate standalone policy parameterization which is ubiquitous in practice. In this work, we address these limitations and extend the theoretical guarantees to parameterized policy classes over large or continuous action spaces. When extending mirror descent to parameterized policies, we identify contextual coupling as the core difficulty, and show how connecting mirror descent to natural policy gradient leads to novel analyses, guarantees, and algorithmic insights, including a surprising unification between offline RL and imitation learning."}

Prior to our work, all positive results in this area made strong restrictions on how models influenced distributions. By using a martingale argument and allowing randomization, we avoid any such assumption and sidestep recent hardness results for finding stable models.

Popular FL algorithms integrate sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into local training to address this issue. However, in the high data heterogeneity setting, the flatness in local training does not imply the flatness of the global model. Therefore, minimizing the sharpness of the local loss surfaces on the client data does not enable the effectiveness of SAM in FL to improve the generalization ability of the global model. We define the \\textbf{flatness distance} to explain this phenomenon.

By eliminating the need to transmit raw data, FL inherently preserves privacy. However, the heterogeneous nature of IoT data, stemming from differences in device capabilities, data formats, and communication constraints, poses significant challenges to maintaining both global model performance and privacy. In the context of IoT-based anomaly detection, unsupervised FL offers a promising means to identify abnormal behavior without centralized data aggregation. Nevertheless, feature heterogeneity across devices complicates model training and optimization, hindering effective implementation. In this study we propose an efficient unsupervised FL framework that enhances anomaly detection by leveraging shared features from two distinct IoT datasets: one focused on anomaly detection and the other on device identification, while preserving dataset-specific features. To improve transparency and interpretability, we employ explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP, to identify key features influencing local model decisions.

In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Concept Embedding Models (HiCEMs), a new family of CEMs that explicitly model concept relationships through hierarchical structures. To enable HiCEMs in real-world settings, we propose Concept Splitting, a method for automatically discovering finer-grained sub-concepts from a pretrained CEM's embedding space without requiring additional annotations. This allows HiCEMs to generate fine-grained explanations from limited concept labels, reducing annotation burdens. Our evaluation across multiple datasets, including a user study and experiments on PseudoKitchens, a newly proposed concept-based dataset of 3D kitchen renders, demonstrates that (1) Concept Splitting discovers human-interpretable sub-concepts absent during training that can be used to train highly accurate HiCEMs, and (2) HiCEMs enable powerful test-time concept interventions at different granularities, leading to improved task accuracy."}

We formalize this trade-off through the concept of Pareto optimality and establish equivalent conditions for Pareto-efficient learning in CMAB. We consider two relevant cases under different information structures, i.e., full-bandit feedback and semi-bandit feedback, and propose two algorithms MixCombKL and MixCombUCB respectively for these two cases.

Neuroimaging modalities, such as structural MRI, provide biomarkers of this transition; however, their high costs and infrastructure needs limit their deployment at a population scale. Speech analysis offers a non-invasive alternative, but speech-only classifiers are developed independently of neuroimaging, leaving decision boundaries biologically ungrounded and limiting reliability on the subtle CN-versus-MCI distinction. We propose MINT (Multimodal Imaging-to-Speech Knowledge Transfer), a three-stage cross-modal framework that transfers biomarker structure from MRI into a speech encoder at training time. An MRI teacher, trained on 1,228 subjects, defines a compact neuroimaging embedding space for CN-versus-MCI classification. A residual projection head aligns speech representations to this frozen imaging manifold via a combined geometric loss, adapting speech to the learned biomarker space while preserving imaging encoder fidelity. The frozen MRI classifier, which is never exposed to speech, is applied to aligned embeddings at inference and requires no scanner. Evaluation on ADNI-4 shows aligned speech achieves performance comparable to speech-only baselines (AUC 0.720 vs 0.711) while requiring no imaging at inference, demonstrating that MRI-derived decision boundaries can ground speech representations. Multimodal fusion improves over MRI alone (0.973 vs 0.958). Ablation studies identify dropout regularization and self-supervised pretraining as critical design decisions.

We propose an agenda built around four components: (i) learnable reward models from specifications to support optimization with clear objectives; (ii) adaptive formal verification integrated throughout learning; (iii) online abstraction calibration to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions; and (iv) test-time synthesis and world-model generation guided by verifiers.

Our findings reveal that reasoning effectiveness is strongly task-dependent, challenging prevailing assumptions: (1) Reasoning shows task-complexity dependence--binary classification degrades up to -19.9 F1 percentage points (pp), while 27-class emotion recognition gains up to +16.0pp; (2) Distilled reasoning variants underperform base models by 3-18 pp on simpler tasks, though few-shot prompting enables partial recovery; (3) Few-shot learning improves over zero-shot in most cases regardless of model type, with gains varying by architecture and task complexity; (4) Pareto frontier analysis shows base models dominate efficiency-performance trade-offs, with reasoning justified only for complex emotion recognition despite 2.1x-54x computational overhead. We complement these quantitative findings with qualitative error analysis revealing that reasoning degrades simpler tasks through systematic over-deliberation, offering mechanistic insight beyond the high-level overthinking hypothesis."}

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on manually tuned scalar coefficients, which often result in unstable or suboptimal performance across tasks, ACWI learns a state dependent scaling coefficient online. Specifically, ACWI introduces a lightweight Beta Network that predicts the intrinsic reward weight directly from the agent state through an encoder based architecture. The scaling mechanism is optimized using a correlation based objective that encourages alignment between the weighted intrinsic rewards and discounted future extrinsic returns. This formulation enables task adaptive exploration incentives while preserving computational efficiency and training stability. We evaluate ACWI on a suite of sparse reward environments in MiniGrid. Experimental results demonstrate that ACWI consistently improves sample efficiency and learning stability compared to fixed intrinsic reward baselines, achieving superior performance with minimal computational overhead."}

We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages."}

By eliminating the need to transmit raw data, FL inherently preserves privacy. However, the heterogeneous nature of IoT data, stemming from differences in device capabilities, data formats, and communication constraints, poses significant challenges to maintaining both global model performance and privacy. In the context of IoT-based anomaly detection, unsupervised FL offers a promising means to identify abnormal behavior without centralized data aggregation. Nevertheless, feature heterogeneity across devices complicates model training and optimization, hindering effective implementation. In this study we propose an efficient unsupervised FL framework that enhances anomaly detection by leveraging shared features from two distinct IoT datasets: one focused on anomaly detection and the other on device identification, while preserving dataset-specific features. To improve transparency and interpretability, we employ explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP, to identify key features influencing local model decisions. Experiments conducted on real-world IoT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional FL approaches in anomaly detection accuracy. This work underscores the potential of using shared features from complementary datasets to optimize unsupervised federated learning and achieve superior anomaly detection results in decentralized IoT environments."}

We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks."}

These rubrics represent the information that assessors believe is important for readers to assess an article's trustworthiness. The assessors then used their rubrics to manually judge the participating teams' submitted runs. To make these tasks and their rubrics reusable, we have created an automated process to judge runs not part of the original assessing. We show that our AutoJudge ranks existing runs well compared to the TREC human-assessed evaluation (Kendall's $τ= 0.678$ for Task 1 and $τ= 0.872$ for Task 2).

This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability."}

In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption."}

Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation."}
