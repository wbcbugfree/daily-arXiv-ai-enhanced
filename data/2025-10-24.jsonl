First presented at the \"Digital Humanities and\n  Artificial Intelligence\" conference at the University of Reading on 17 June\n  2024", "summary": "This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern\nreligious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in\ncombination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages\nthe full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,\nallowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual\nand textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass\ncodes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%\nprecision at five and four levels of classification, significantly\noutperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing\nfull-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,\noffering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual\narchives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of\nLLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities."}

By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov\nchain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification\narising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.\nExperiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield\nconsistently tighter $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared\nto R\\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in\ndecentralized privacy accounting."}

A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that\nfine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a\nperformance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.\nAdditionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for\nscoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps.

However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model\ngenerates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast\nto previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where\nthe response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To\naddress citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study\nwhen citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we\nextend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and\nevidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that\nsystematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show\nthat failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining\ncitation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2.

We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model\nprototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,\nindependent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling\neliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields\nconsistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance."}

Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what\napproximate notions of replicability is learning possible?\n  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the\ncontext of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any\nfixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the\nlearner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution\nconsistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally\nuse shared unlabeled samples.

In this paper, we show that adding a\nsteering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and\nmake the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering\ntechnique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a\ntwo-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge\nnaturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual\ndescriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not\nduring deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation\ncue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert\niteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model\nis evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than\ndeployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the\nevaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation\nawareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is\npresent.

In addition\nto the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:\na Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models\nobtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a\nmonolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that\nCantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform\nbetter on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain\nsettings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese\ndomain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to\nfacilitate future research in Cantonese NLP."}

For further transparency, Grad-CAM is\nintegrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving\nprediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical\ninterpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\\% accuracy on the 7K-DS\ndataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\\% and 99.85\\% in the 3-class\nand 2-class settings, respectively.

Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy\nas the evaluation metric.

To address this limitation, we investigate scaling\nfrom the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based\nProbability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct\ntoken is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we\nestablish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves\nwith increasing model size.

By specializing this bound to\njoint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based\ninformation increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.\nFurthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives\nand observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier\ntrained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational\nlower bound on the JSD.

To investigate this, we train a 270M\nparameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,\ndesigned to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows\nthat Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong\nrule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by\nconsistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the\ntraining data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.\nIn a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including\nChess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions\nof pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy\nadaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit\nsearch, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the\ntraining dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own\npieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game."}

To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts.

Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees.

To validate this, we introduce\nND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA\nadapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces\nhallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general\naccuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,\ncausal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and\ncorrelational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is\nassociated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent\noptimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal\nneurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third\naxis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the\nreliability of language models at fixed budgets."}

While elegant, this definition assumes\n\\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset\nfailure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect\n\\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential\ndomains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of\ngeneralized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This\nformulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the\nresulting \\textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under\nvarying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards\nspecialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain\ndependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,\nthe coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general\ncompetence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\\%). Integrating\nthe generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter\nfoundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI."}

We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and\nspace complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention\nwith token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,\nwe propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with\nsliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates\ninformation from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a\nlimited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's\nconstant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse\nattention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive\nbenchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches."}

Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection.

Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text.
