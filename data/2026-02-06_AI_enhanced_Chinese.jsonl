We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\\hat{q}_t = q_t + \u03b3p_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \\geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $\u03b3^* = 4.17 \\times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility.

However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed.

As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u518d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5185\u79ef\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u518d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepRead\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06PDF\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316Markdown\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bb5\u843d\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u201c\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u9605\u8bfb\u201d\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u6863\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5757\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u8bed\u7bc7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u957f\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\u3002", "method": "DeepRead\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\uff08OCR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5c06PDF\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u6807\u9898\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316Markdown\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u6bb5\u843d\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6bb5\u843d\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5176\u7ae0\u8282\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u6bb5\u5185\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u7c7b\u5750\u6807\u5143\u6570\u636e\u952e\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0cDeepRead\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u843d\u5e76\u66b4\u9732\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5750\u6807\uff08\u5e26\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u7ae0\u8282\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u7ae0\u8282\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeepRead\u5728\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4Search-o1\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u9605\u8bfb\u5de5\u5177\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u201c\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u9605\u8bfb\u201d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepRead\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5c06\u6587\u6863\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u9605\u8bfb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead.

We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status.

In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ODE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SDE\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6f02\u79fb\u9879\u5305\u542b\u5df2\u77e5\u7684ODE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u9879\u5305\u542b\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8026\u5408\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MLE\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation.

As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.\n  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.\n  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning.

Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "TPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u65b9\u5dee\u8fc7\u9ad8\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "TPC\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cTPC\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e8c\u6b21\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cImageNet\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTPC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cTPC\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684SOTA\uff08State-of-the-Art\uff09\u98ce\u683c\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "TPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Priebe", "Peter Viechnicki"], "title": "Data Kernel Perspective Space Performance Guarantees for Synthetic Data from Transformer Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models.

As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u70b9\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08GAPO\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u66ff\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u951a\u70b9\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5c0f\u534a\u5f84\u5185\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u60b2\u89c2\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002GAPO\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u951a\u70b9\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08Anchor Gap\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u951a\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u88d5\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "GAPO\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling.

However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health.

We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average.

On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u62b5\u6297\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u56db\u7c7b\u6076\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u56db\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u6765\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5e76\u7981\u7528/\u5c4f\u853d\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d7.12%\u548c7.94%\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u4e8695.31%\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u62b5\u6297\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\uff08ADR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u71c3\u6599\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u957f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u788e\u7247\u4ea4\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6807\u79f0\u63a9\u7801\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u63a9\u7801PPO\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u6734\u7d20\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u5728\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\uff08ADR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u71c3\u6599\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u957f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6807\u79f0\u63a9\u7801\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u63a9\u7801PPO\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u6734\u7d20\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b\u71c3\u6599\u8865\u7ed9\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6807\u79f0\u3001\u71c3\u6599\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u788e\u7247\u573a\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f68\u9053\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9300\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u79f0PPO\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316PPO\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u79f0\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u6709\u9002\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002MCTS\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5374\u9ad8\u51fa\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u7684ADR\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers.

Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u70bc\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u63d0\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5355-\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u52a0\u8f7d\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u70bc\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355-\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u65ad\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e2a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.0%\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534714.9%\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355-\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHeteroComp\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5f20\u91cf\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u2018\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5f02\u5e38\u2019\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u5f20\u91cf\u6d41\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u6765\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "HeteroComp\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u5f20\u91cf\u6d41\u8fde\u7eed\u5730\u6982\u62ec\u4e3a\u2018\u7ec4\u4ef6\u2019\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee3\u8868\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7fa4\u7ec4\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8fde\u7eed\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "HeteroComp\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHeteroComp\u5728\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HeteroComp\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u5f20\u91cf\u6d41\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A Comparative Study on Bluesky", "comment": null, "summary": "As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.\n  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones.

To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components.

While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality.

Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs.

In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences.

Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.", "AI": {"tldr":

To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the \"boiling frog\" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning.

Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution.

However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \\textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \\textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \\emph{semantic vagueness}, \\emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \\emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \\emph{unresolved confusion} and \\emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\\approx$0.80).

Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model.

In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \\modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \\modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging\uff08\nmodelname\n\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u6279\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\nmodelname\n\u7684bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6279\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\nmodelname\n\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u5168\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6279\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\nmodelname\n\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9886\u57df\u65f6\u3002"}}

By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects.

Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff08BCs\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f2a\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u7ebf\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u5f39\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5185\u768418\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u3001\u5206\u91cf\u5f0f\u7684\u548c\u591a\u6bb5\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u65e0\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u754c\u5230\u57df\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data.

This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters.

However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation.

During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance.

In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \\emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\\%, 11.25\\%, and 9.55\\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($\u0393$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $\u0393$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics.

Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u65f6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa grounding \u5230\u5916\u90e8\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KGs\uff09\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dLLMs\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u89e3\u91caCypher\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9eKG\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5f71KG\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u768490\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5728Hyena KG\u548cMaRDI KG\u4e0a\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u5c0f\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u65f6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6587\u672cRAG\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9700\u8981\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u89e3\u91caCypher\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5f71KG\u3001Hyena KG\u548cMaRDI KG\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7684Cypher\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548cLLM\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration.

Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent.

Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSRv2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fk-\u9000\u706b\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5168\u9aa8\u5e72\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5e38\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\uff08CSR\uff09\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CSRv2\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "CSRv2\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fk-\u9000\u706b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9aa8\u5e72\u5fae\u8c03\u786e\u4fdd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "CSRv2\u5c06\u6b7b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ece80%\u964d\u4f4e\u523020%\uff0c\u5728k=2\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534714%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8ek=8\u7684CSR\u548c32\u7ef4\u7684MRL\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e867\u500d\u4e8eMRL\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe300\u500d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCSRv2\u5728k=2\u548ck=4\u65f6\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eCSR\u3002", "conclusion": "CSRv2\u4f7f\u5f97\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u90fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To appear in the conference proceedings", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold.

However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transolver-3 is a scalable framework for neural PDE solvers that uses architectural optimizations (faster slice/deslice, geometry slice tiling), amortized training, and caching to handle industrial-scale meshes (over 160 million cells) for high-fidelity physics simulations, demonstrating strong performance in aircraft and automotive design.", "motivation": "Scaling neural PDE solvers to industrial-scale geometries ($>10^8$ cells) is challenging due to high memory complexity.

Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness.

Hongyin Zan is corresponding author, Jiafan Lu is first co-author", "summary": "Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce \u03c0-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that \u03c0-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on \u03c0-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PI\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700PI\u5373\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f88\u6709\u7528\u3002\u4f46\u5c06PI\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700PI\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8f6eAgent\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03c0-Distill\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u5e08\u751f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aPI\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86On-Policy Self-Distillation\uff08OPSD\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411KL\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u548cPI\u6761\u4ef6\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4ec5\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684PI\u6765\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u6cbfAgent\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548cPI\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8fdb\u884cRL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PI\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5229\u7528PI\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8f6eAgent\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6b64\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03c0-Distill\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u5e08\u751f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aPI\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86On-Policy Self-Distillation\uff08OPSD\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411KL\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u548cPI\u6761\u4ef6\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u03c0-Distill\u548cOPSD\u5728\u5229\u7528\u4ec5\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684PI\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u6cbfAgent\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548cPI\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8fdb\u884cRL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03c0-Distill\u548cOPSD\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684PI\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bOPSD\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6eAgent\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6Agent\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines.

Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \\textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\\times$ speedup with nearly 5\\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u665a-\u65e9\u8bad\u7ec3\u201d\uff08LET\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u671f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u665a-\u65e9\u8bad\u7ec3\u201d\uff08LET\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u540e\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u3002\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u665a-\u65e9\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u665a-\u65e9\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "LET\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u57281.4B\u548c7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLET\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec31.4B LLM\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u53471.6\u500d\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd15%\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u662f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u768410\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LET\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees.

Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth.

Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware.

This is a pre-MIT Press publication version", "summary": "Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems.

Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges.

To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation.

We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a EntRGi \u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u5dee\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a EntRGi\uff08\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8c03\u8282\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728 7B \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 3 \u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c 3 \u4e2a\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cEntRGi \u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EntRGi \u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents.

Shakil Hossain", "Sudipto Chaki", "Md Shafiqul Islam"], "title": "Reasoning under Ambiguity: Uncertainty-Aware Multilingual Emotion Classification under Partial Supervision", "comment": null, "summary": "Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty.

In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al.

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively.

This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs.

Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks.

Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings.

This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics.

Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.

However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes.

This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \\textbf{ALIVE} (\\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \\emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIVE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u5185\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8106\u5f31\u548c\u76f2\u533a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "ALIVE\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u8ba4\u77e5\u534f\u540c\u201d\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5185\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u5185\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u5916\u90e8\u6279\u8bc4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5185\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cALIVE\u6846\u67b6\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cALIVE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIVE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u201d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u7ef4\u6301\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReFORM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OGBench\u57fa\u51c6\u768440\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "ReFORM\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5c04\u6d41\uff0c\u8be5\u53cd\u5c04\u6d41\u4e3aBC\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6709\u754c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "ReFORM\u5728OGBench\u57fa\u51c6\u768440\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u66f2\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReFORM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u9650\u5236\u6027\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684OOD\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations.

Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u53d8\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e14GPU\u517c\u5bb9\u7684TensorGalerkin\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u88c5\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002TensorGalerkin\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Python\u7ea7\u522b\u7684Map\u9636\u6bb5\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\uff1ai\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u7684PDE\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0cii\uff09\u7528\u4e8ePDE\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caiii\uff09\u7528\u4e8ePDE\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u62ec2D\u548c3D\u692d\u5706\u3001\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u548c\u53cc\u66f2PDE\uff08\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\uff09\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90fd\u6bd4\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6765\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528TensorGalerkin\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5305\u62ecMap\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u88c5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301GPU\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u548c3D\u692d\u5706\u3001\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u548c\u53cc\u66f2PDE\uff08\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\uff09\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u7684TensorGalerkin\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7684PDE\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems.

Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Speculative decoding with LLMs is slow due to latency.

This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types.

Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting.

However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning.

However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

In this model, the SGD training has no \\textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum.

However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.\n  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.\n  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora.

This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic \"Think-and-Read\" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts.

A Reliability Metric for XAI", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG)\u7b49\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u6270\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08ERI\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53ERI-T\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ERI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u3001\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u8861\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SHAP\u548cIG\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08ERI\uff09\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u516c\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1a\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6e29\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLipschitz\u578b\u754c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ERI-T\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ERI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002ERI\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ERI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8XAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting.

However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs).

However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench.

Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.\n  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity.

Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios.

Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdamW\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c", "motivation": "AdamW\u867d\u7136\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5f84\u5411\u62c9\u952f\u6218\u201d\u51b2\u7a81\uff1a\u68af\u5ea6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u6570\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u6709\u6548\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5219\u6291\u5236\u8303\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5f84\u5411\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u5207\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6b63\u4ea4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u8026\u201d\uff08Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aAdamO\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002AdamO\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3cSGD\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u7ef4\u8303\u6570\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800cAdam\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5207\u5411\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cAdamO\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u66f2\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f84\u5411\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u5c42\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdamO\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AdamO\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8303\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AdamW\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u5f84\u5411\u62c9\u952f\u6218\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency \"Sweet Spots\" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6548\u5e76\u975e\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u6700\u4f18\u533a\u57df\u201d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5bf9AI\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528TensorRT-LLM\u5728NVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdLLMs\uff081B-9B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0864-4096 tokens\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.79%\u7684\u5e73\u5747MAPE\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u6548\u201c\u6700\u4f18\u533a\u57df\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u957f\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u957f\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0b\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u6781\u77ed\u8f93\u51fa\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u6548\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u80fd\u6548\u201c\u6700\u4f18\u533a\u57df\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u622a\u65ad\u3001\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.", "AI": {"tldr":

Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "KV-CoRE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSVD\u7684kv-cache\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316kv-cache\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56kv-cache\u6765\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0ckv-cache\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u9971\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684kv-cache\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86kv-cache\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "KV-CoRE\uff08KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSVD\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316kv-cache\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u4f4e\u79e9\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97Frobenius\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u3001\u9010\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u82f1\u8bed\u9886\u57df\u548c\u5341\u516d\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "KV-CoRE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM kv-cache\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR \u5b58\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u7a7a\u95f4\u6536\u7f29\uff08RSC\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6982\u7387\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684 KL \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u4eff\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u951a\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08APO\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u3002APO \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u9510\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ea0\u9519\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8c03\u7528\u6062\u590d\u529b\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cAPO \u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u81a8\u80c0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u652f\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cAPO \u80fd\u591f\u6253\u7834\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8 Pass@1 \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u7684 Pass@K \u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u8eab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6811\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u7a7a\u95f4\u6536\u7f29\uff08RSC\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u3002RSC \u662f\u7531\u6b63\u9510\u5316\u548c\u8d1f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8f6c\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6982\u7387\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u951a\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08APO\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u3002APO \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u9510\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ea0\u9519\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8c03\u7528\u6062\u590d\u529b\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cAPO \u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u81a8\u80c0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u652f\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cAPO \u6253\u7834\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 Pass@1 \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u7684 Pass@K \u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "APO \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 RLVR \u4e2d\u7684 RSC \u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u79ef\u6781\u9510\u5316\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6062\u590d\u529b\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes.

Multilingual LLM Answers to Value-laden Multiple-Choice Questions", "comment": "17 pages, 5 figures (8 pages of references and appendices)", "summary": "Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u503c the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS) \u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5305\u542b\u4ef7\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6d89\u53ca\u4ef7\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u56e0\u63d0\u95ee\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b8\u79cd\u6b27\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684MEVS\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u53d6\u5176\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u9898\u76ee\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u5341\u4f59\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5236\u9020\u5546\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u56de\u7b54\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u5b57\u7b26\u7b49\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5927\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u56e0\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5219\u5206\u6b67\u8f83\u5927\u3002\u6240\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u4e4e\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4ec5\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u4ef7\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u50cf\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8005\u90a3\u6837\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5176\u56de\u7b54\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u63d0\u95ee\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u504f\u597d\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier.

Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families.

To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation.

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies.

However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench.

Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b1,437\u540d\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53d9\u8ff0\u548cPTSD\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u6458\u8981\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u6807\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u4e5d\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f3011\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u53d9\u8ff0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b2. \u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b3. \u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08Llama, Deepseek\uff09\u572870B\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5e73\u7a33\uff0c\u800c\u5c01\u95ed\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08o3-mini, gpt-5\uff09\u968f\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u63a8\u51fa\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b4. \u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Aviles-Rivero"], "title": "SpectraKAN: Conditioning Spectral Operators", "comment": null, "summary": "Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation.

Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates.

Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cdP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6top-p\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cbe\u70bc\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7684top-k\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u800ctop-p\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316top-p\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDouble-P\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u5c0f\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684top-p\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2atop-p\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDouble-P\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1.8\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa1.3\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Double-P\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons.

Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08GAD\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08GAD\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1. \u79bb\u6563\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5f02\u5e38\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u56fe\uff1b2. \u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\uff08M&S\uff09\u9886\u57df\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0d\u5f53\u6216\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3aLLM\u5728M&S\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982RAG\u548cLoRA\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5efa\u6a21\u8005\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728M&S\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6216\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56LLMs\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u6df7\u6dc6\u70b9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\uff08RAG\u548cLoRA\uff09\u3001M&S\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6dfb\u52a0\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a0\u5e76\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f7fLLM\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u91cfM&S\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u591a\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728M&S\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8003\u8651LLM\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f7d\u8d27\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff08CVRP\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08A2C\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u3001\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca20\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u548c4\u8f86\u8f66\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5341\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u8def\u7ebf\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u8def\u7ebf\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f7d\u8d27\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff08CVRP\uff09\u7b49\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08A2C\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u3001\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u8be5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u768420\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u548c4\u8f86\u8f66\u7684CVRP\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ecf\u5178\u3001\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u8def\u7ebf\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u8def\u7ebf\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u66f4\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f7d\u8d27\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff08CVRP\uff09\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \\textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\\% of both MLP and attention structures.

Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u548cQKV\u6c60\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ASR\u7cfb\u7edfWhisper\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08SER\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aQKV\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ShEMO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.47%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5728\u6ce2\u65af\u8bedSER\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Whisper\u4f5c\u4e3aSER\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08SER\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ASR\u7cfb\u7edfWhisper\u5728SER\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u548cQKV\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceWhisper\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u5728IEMOCAP\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u548cShEMO\uff08\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Whisper Tiny\u548cSmall\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cWhisper\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728ShEMO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5934QKV\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.47%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bedSER\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cWhisper\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e0eHuBERT X-Large\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cWhisper\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "Whisper\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fQKV\u6c60\u5316\uff09\u5728\u964d\u7ef4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3aSER\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Code and models will be released at opencores.ai", "summary": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the \"Memory Wall\" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.\n  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.\n  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u95e8\u63a7\u6d41\uff08HGF\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e861.58\u4f4d\u4e09\u5143\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9FP16\u6821\u6b63\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u201c\u5185\u5b58\u5899\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u76841.58\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u95e8\u63a7\u6d41\uff08HGF\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5c061.58\u4f4d\u4e09\u5143\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0e\u7531\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9FP16\u6821\u6b63\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728TinyStories\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHGF\u57282500\u548c3500\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.9306\u548c1.0294\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0bBitNet\u4e3a1.0294\u3002HGF\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u4e09\u5143\u91cf\u5316\u4e0eFP16\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ea655%\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ea612-15%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cHGF\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7eafFP16\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5219\u51fa\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff081.2B\u548c3B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86HGF\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "HGF\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u91cf\u5316\u800c\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u91cf\u5316\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002HGF\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u540c\u6837\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse.

However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "A data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) models shooter behavior learned from VR studies to enable scalable evaluation of school security interventions, such as a robot-based strategy.", "motivation": "Assessing new interventions in VR for school security is difficult due to the need for new participant cohorts for each condition, hindering large-scale or iterative evaluation, especially for learning effective intervention strategies.", "method": "Developed a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies.

As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmbedOpt\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e14\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u6784\u8c61\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cEmbedOpt\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u56fe\u62df\u5408\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e14\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "EmbedOpt\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f3\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u5171\u6f14\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u56fe\u62df\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEmbedOpt\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEmbedOpt\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cEmbedOpt\u5728\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "EmbedOpt\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f3\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u6784\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling.

In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering.

Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to \"stitch\" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values.

The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL.

Work is under review at ICML 2026. First two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unitary graph convolutions can hurt performance in tasks with natural smoothing, like diffusion processes.

Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN.

Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%.

Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts.

We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u6e05\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Erase at the Core\uff08EC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8868\u5c42\u5230\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u201c\u4e0d\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\uff08logits\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6e05\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5373\u201c\u8868\u9762\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faErase at the Core\uff08EC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u3002EC\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\uff08retain set\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\uff1a\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76d1\u7763\u70b9\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "EC\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684logits\u5c42\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002EC\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u8868\u9762\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6e05\u9664\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u63d2\u4ef6\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "REAL\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8bef\u5206\u914d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u8bef\u5206\u914d\uff08\u6b63\u4f8b\uff09\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff08\u8d1f\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRewards as Labels (REAL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u800c\u975e\u6807\u91cf\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u951a\u70b9logits\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002REAL\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5355\u8c03\u4e14\u6709\u754c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "REAL\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57281.5B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6bd4DAPO\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747Pass@1\u3002\u57287B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cREAL\u6bd4DAPO\u548cGSPO\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866.2%\u548c1.7%\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff0cREAL\u4e5f\u6bd4DAPO\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "REAL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u951a\u70b9logits\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits.

However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5f39\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "1. \u501f\u9274\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u540e\u95e8\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u6d17\u724c\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u3002 2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08CKKS\uff09\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5185\u6838\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u805a\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6548\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728FEMNIST\u3001CIFAR10\u3001GTSRB\u548cacsincome\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSVM\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8690%\u523094%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a8\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u6709\u8fb9\u9645\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u805a\u5408\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a8\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u57286\u523026\u79d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u62b5\u5fa1\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\\approx$ 20\\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6RL\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u662f\u56fa\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u8fd8\u662f\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6RL\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6RL\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08HIQL\u548cQRL\uff09\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bca\u65ad\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfRL\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHIQL\u548cQRL\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7ea620%\uff09\u65f6\uff0cQRL\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u800cHIQL\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u3001\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6f02\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u533a\u57df\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bca\u65ad\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff08bootstrapped objectives\uff09\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff08bootstrapping\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u79cd\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLM-Scope \u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (DLM) \u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668 (SAE) \u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0 SAE \u63d2\u5165 DLM \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52 LLM \u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\u3002DLM-Scope \u5728 DLM \u7684\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a DLM \u7684 SAE \u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (DLM) \u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u4e3a DLM \u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DLM-Scope\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e SAE \u7684 DLM \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684 Top-K SAE \u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 SAE \u63d2\u5165\u5bf9 DLM \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e LLM \u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86 SAE \u5728 DLM \u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca SAE \u7279\u5f81\u5728 DLM \u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684 Top-K SAE \u53ef\u4ee5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u63d0\u53d6 DLM \u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e0e LLM \u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSAE \u63d2\u5165 DLM \u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u3002DLM \u7684 SAE \u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4 LLM \u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u3002SAE \u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a DLM \u7684\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14 SAE \u7279\u5f81\u5728 DLM \u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "DLM-Scope \u4e3a DLM \u7684\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06 SAE \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e DLM \u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u70ed\u529b\u5b66Epiplexity/\u7126\u8033\u548cEmpowerment/\u7126\u8033\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5173\u4e4e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5173\u4e4e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u63a5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u70ed\u529b\u5b66Epiplexity/\u7126\u8033\u548cEmpowerment/\u7126\u8033\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86Epiplexity\u83b7\u53d6\u7684Landauer\u5c3a\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u8017\u6563\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u8054\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6784\u9020\u3002\u5f53\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06Epiplexity\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684MDL Epiplexity\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528MDL-Epiplexity/\u538b\u7f29\u589e\u76ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0cClarified Landauer\u6210\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u8017\u6563\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u8054\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6784\u9020\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u4e86MDL-Epiplexity/\u538b\u7f29\u589e\u76ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u548c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684bits-per-Joule\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u52fe\u52d2\u4e86\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u7f29\u653e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/EUQ", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \\emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5608\u6742\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u548cFlowRL\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u76d1\u7763\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728LLM\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5e03RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u70b9\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u503c\u8868\u793a\u7c97\u7cd9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u548cOOD\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "DFPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u503c\u6d41\u573a\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0cDFPO\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u5608\u6742\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cDFPO\u8fd8\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6cbf\u503c\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDFPO\u5728\u5608\u6742\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u3001FlowRL\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9c81\u68d2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DFPO\u901a\u8fc7\u503c\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus.

With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative. Although existing benchmarks have facilitated initial progress, they exhibit critical limitations in domain coverage, encoder flexibility, model diversity, and task scope, presenting significant challenges to fair evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenMAG, a comprehensive benchmark that integrates 19 datasets across 6 domains and incorporates 16 encoders to support both static and trainable feature encoding.

We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks.

Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points.

In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "In-context learning tabular foundation models, while state-of-the-art, suffer from quadratic complexity in dataset size due to their attention-based transformer architecture.

Theoretical analysis of behavioral alignment evaluation", "summary": "Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.\n  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.\n  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.\n  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9690\u542b\u7684\u4e14\u672a\u7ecf\u5145\u5206\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u201c\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u201d\u548c\u201c\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u517c\u5bb9\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u5176\u7f29\u51cf\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u5185\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u201c\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u201d\u548c\u201c\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u610f\u8bc6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u552f\u4e00\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002\u5373\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u5730\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e94\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u5185\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\\log(t)}$, where $\u03b2_p = \\frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \\in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p/2}}$, $p \\in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SGD\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u79cd\uff08\u5982c-SGD\uff09\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\u7684\u7d27\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd0\u7528\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u548c\u88c1\u526aSGD\uff08c-SGD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u5bf9SGD\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u754c\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u8fed\u4ee3\u70b9\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u5e73\u65b9\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e3a $e^{-t/\text{log}(t)}$\u30022. \u5bf9c-SGD\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\uff08p\u9636\u77e9\u5b58\u5728\uff0cp \u2208 (1,2]\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e3a $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\text{log}(t)}$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d $\u03b2_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ (p \u2208 (1,2)) \u6216 $e^{-t/\text{log}^2(t)}$ (p=2)\u30023. \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e3a $e^{-t}$\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u5f97\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u7d27\u786e\u6027\uff08\u5728\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u5185\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86SGD\u548cc-SGD\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u9650\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eSGD\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e3a $e^{-t/\text{log}(t)}$\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8ec-SGD\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e3a $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\text{log}(t)}$ \u6216 $e^{-t/\text{log}^2(t)}$\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7 $e^{-t}$ \u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u5f97\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u7d27\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u91cf\u5316\u4e86SGD\u548cc-SGD\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7d27\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u9650\u7684\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4f53\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity.

Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aPBP\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2dPOMDPs\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002PBP\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5e95\u5c42\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684POMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPBP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "PBP\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cPBP\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PBP\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PBP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684POMDP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528AlphaEvolve\u7b49\u5305\u542bLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a81\u53d8\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728FLOP\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u641c\u7d22\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684Python\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08out-of-distribution\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Federated Learning (FL)\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FedRandom\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u9700\u8981\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u671f\u671b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u5176\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u79f0\u7684\u8865\u507f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u548c\u201c\u642d\u4fbf\u8f66\u8005\u201d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2a\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d21\u732e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFedRandom\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002FedRandom\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c4FL\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001MNIST\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cFMNIST\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eFedRandom\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c06\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FedRandom\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6837\u672c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6fc0\u52b1\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent \"fairness helps accuracy\" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness.

We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice.

This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution.

In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions.

However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFRecs \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u4f46\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8 GNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u66f4\u6539\u3002", "method": "CFRecs \u4f7f\u7528\u7531 GNN \u548c Graph-VAE \u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u6539\u3002", "result": "CFRecs \u5728 Zillow \u7684\u7528\u6237-\u623f\u6e90\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "CFRecs \u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8d2d\u623f\u548c\u552e\u623f\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Submitted to Mathematical Programming", "summary": "Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u7f6e\u65b9\u5411\uff08SOD\uff09\u7684\u9003\u9038\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5b9e\u9645\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u978d\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9003\u9038\u4f2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9003\u9038\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u611f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u8bb8\u591a\u4f2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u978d\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u7f6e\u65b9\u5411\uff08SOD\uff09\u7684\u9003\u9038\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u9884\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9884\u7f6e\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9003\u9038\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9003\u9038\u4f2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u3002"}}

Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u56e0\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u820d\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u503c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u91cf\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u820d\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301PTQ\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5931\u914d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u820d\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6709\u754c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8ePTQ\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u820d\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/szegedai/world-model-verification", "summary": "Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u68cb\u7c7b\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5065\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5065\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5065\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5224\u65ad\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u201c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5065\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u8feb\u4f7f\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5065\u5168\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u53ca\u68cb\u76d8\u72b6\u6001\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5065\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u68cb\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5065\u5168\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5065\u5168\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u68cb\u76d8\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u8d77\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5065\u5168\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u68cb\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u5065\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (T\u00fclu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u63a5\u89e6\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e9b\u9664\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9690\u6027\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5374\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9b\u51fa\u4e4e\u610f\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u5757\u72b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u201d\uff08chunky post-training\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5757\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSURF\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aTURF\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u8d25\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude 4.5\u3001GPT-5.1\u3001Grok 4.1\u3001Gemini 3\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08T\u00fclu 3\uff09\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5757\u72b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u5931\u5e38\uff0c\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u5e38\u5e38\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5757\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u63a5\u89e6\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e9b\u9664\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9690\u6027\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5374\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9b\u51fa\u4e4e\u610f\u6599\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u5757\u72b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u201d\uff08chunky post-training\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5757\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSURF\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aTURF\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u8d25\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude 4.5\u3001GPT-5.1\u3001Grok 4.1\u3001Gemini 3\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08T\u00fclu 3\uff09\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5757\u72b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u5931\u5e38\uff0c\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u5e38\u5e38\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5757\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5757\u72b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u51fa\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u5931\u5e38\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u8054\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5757\u6240\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u3002SURF\u548cTURF\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$\u03c7^2$ regularizer. This additional $\u03c7^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.", "code_url": "https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKim", "AI": {"tldr": "PMD\u5728LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6709\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002PMD-mean\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u914d\u9879\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408KL--$\u03c7^2$\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u955c\u9762\u4e0b\u964d\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660ePMD-mean\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5728LLM\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6b21\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff08PMD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u914d\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002 ", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPMD-mean\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u7528\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u914d\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5f52\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86PMD-mean\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b83\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408KL--$\u03c7^2$\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u955c\u9762\u4e0b\u964d\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "PMD-mean\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684$\u03c7^2$\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u671f\u5956\u52b1\u4f4e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u5927\u7684\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPMD-mean\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PMD-mean\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u914d\u9879\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408KL--$\u03c7^2$\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86PMD\u5728LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9PMD-mean\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds.

However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u7834\u574f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a OrthoMerge \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u7fa4\u6784\u6210\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002OrthoMerge \u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5fae\u8c03 (OFT) \u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e2\u6709\u539f\u5219\u6027\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4-\u6b8b\u5dee\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u4ea4 Procrustes \u95ee\u9898\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u7fa4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u5408\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u5176\u4f59\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e OrthoMerge \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u672f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "OrthoMerge \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u7fa4\u6784\u6210\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5fae\u8c03 (OFT) \u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4-\u6b8b\u5dee\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u4ea4 Procrustes \u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u7fa4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u5408\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u5176\u4f59\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002", "result": "OrthoMerge \u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OrthoMerge \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u4ea4-\u6b8b\u5dee\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schr\u00f6dinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time.

We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \\emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \\emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \\citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \\ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \\citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion.

While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference.

In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AP-OOD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6587\u672c\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86XSUM\u548cWMT15\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684token\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u79bb\u7fa4\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "AP-OOD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u79bb\u7fa4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "AP-OOD\u5728\u6587\u672c\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u679c\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06XSUM\u6458\u8981\u4e0a\u7684FPR95\u4ece27.84%\u964d\u4f4e\u52304.67%\uff0c\u5c06WMT15\u82f1\u6cd5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0a\u7684FPR95\u4ece77.08%\u964d\u4f4e\u523070.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "AP-OOD\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u3002"}}
