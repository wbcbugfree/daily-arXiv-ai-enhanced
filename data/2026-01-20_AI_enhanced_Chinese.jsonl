In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

However, we also find that instruction following performance, crucial to the user experience of interacting with models, does not mirror ranking relevance improvements and displays insensitivity or counter-intuitive behavior to instructions.

However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used.

Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u535a\u5f08\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4ee5Tic-Tac-Toe\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebfLLM\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728100\u5c40\u5bf9\u5c40\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u68cb\u5c40\u7ed3\u679c\u4ece-11.6%\u63d0\u5347\u5230+9.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u71b5\u4e0e\u8d70\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u68c0\u7d22\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 in-context learning \u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u68c0\u7d22\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u91cf\uff1a\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u8def\u5f84CoT\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4ee5Tic-Tac-Toe\u4e3a\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bf9\u624b\u4e3a\u6b21\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30100\u5c40\u5bf9\u5c40\u7684\u80dc\u8d1f\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8bc1\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728100\u5c40\u5bf9\u5c40\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7ed3\u679c\u4ece defeats baseline \u7684-11.6% \u63d0\u5347\u81f3 +9.5%\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c40\u7ed3\u679c\u6309\u80dc/\u5e73/\u8d1f\u8ba1+1/0/-1\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u4e0e\u8d70\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines.

While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .", "code_url": "https://github.com/microsoft/byol", "AI": {"tldr": "BYOL \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6309\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u4e3a Extreme-Low/Low/Mid/High \u56db\u5c42\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u6808\u6570\u636e refining\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728 Chichewa\u3001Maori \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347 12%\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u82f1\u8bed/\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5bf9\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u91c7\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728 Inuktitut \u4e0a\u628a\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 BLEU \u63d0\u5347 4 \u5206\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf LLM \u5165\u53e3\u3002\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u4ee5 Chichewa\u3001Maori\u3001Inuktitut \u4e3a\u6bcd\u8bed\u7684 Global MMLU-Lite \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801/\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c7,000 \u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5c11\u6570\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u89e6\u70b9\u6765\u9a71\u52a8\u73b0\u4ee3 LLM \u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6587\u5316\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9762\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528 Language footprint \u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u7c7b\uff08Extreme-Low/Low/Mid/High\uff09\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u96c6\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5bf9 Low \u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u884c\u5168\u6808\u6570\u636e refinement \u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a\u8bed\u6599\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e Extreme-Low\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u82f1\u8bed/\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d1\u5e03\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u7684 Global MMLU-Lite \u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Chichewa \u4e0e Maori \u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5f97\u5230\u7ea6 12% \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8986\u76d6 12 \u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5bf9 Inuktitut\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f83\u5546\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf BLEU \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 4 \u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684 LLM \u5165\u53e3\u3002 combines \u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "BYOL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u7684 LLM \u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5165\u53e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u73b0\u4e0e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO).

Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency.

This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration.

Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability.

We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify (\"Is this statement correct?\") versus attributed to a speaker (\"Is this speaker correct?\"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI.

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u5171\u9a7e\uff08AI co-pilot\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528U-Net\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4e\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u9ed1\u7bb1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e3a\u6700\u957f\u62d3\u6251\u6210\u5458\u6216\u6700\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fee\u6539\u533a\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u7684TO\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u5916\u5448\u73b0 emergent \u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AI\u5171\u9a7e\u7684TO\u5728\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u5c48\u66f2\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea639%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTO\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea615\u79d2\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5171\u9a7e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

As these two media increasingly converge in everyday information-seeking behavior, it is essential to explore how their interaction influences user attitudes, particularly in contexts involving controversial, value-laden, and often debated topics. Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions.

Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance.

However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.\n  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text.

Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics.

The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAction Shapley\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf/\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4eShapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6307\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0>80%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eAction Shapley\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u610f\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u65e0\u504f\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002Shapley\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5c06Action Shapley\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf/\u6a21\u578b\u57faRL\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAction Shapley\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u504f\u4e14\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97Action Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u7edfShapley\u7684\u6307\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347>80%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eAction Shapley\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\uff08ad-hoc\uff09\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "Action Shapley\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf/\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8RL\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u5176\u5b83\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality.

Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces.

FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAConvLSTM introduces a factorized-attention ConvLSTM that serves as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D, reducing computation while enhancing spatial expressiveness and interpretability through bottleneck gate factorization, depthwise spatial mixing, multi-scale dilated branches, SE recalibration, peephole timing, axial attention, and a subspace head with temporal self-attention and seasonal positional encoding.", "motivation": "ConvLSTM2D suffers from heavy computation due to dense gating and strictly local receptive fields, limiting modeling of long-range spatial structure, teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity in high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data.", "method": "FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations with 1x1 bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, employs multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration, incorporates peephole connections, adds lightweight axial spatial attention applied sparsely in time to capture teleconnections, and includes a dedicated subspace head with temporal self-attention and fixed seasonal positional encoding.", "result": "Empirical evaluation on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.", "conclusion": "FAConvLSTM provides an efficient, spatially expressive, and physically interpretable drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D, improving performance on complex climate data and enabling scalable analysis of multivariate spatiotemporal dynamics."}}

Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa HOSL\uff1a\u5728\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u7136\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u655b\u6162\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6298\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u9636 HOSL\uff1a\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u56de\u4f20\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u7387 O(\u221a(d_c / (TQ)))\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d d_c \u4e3a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u968f\u66f4\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u653e\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 OPT \u6a21\u578b\uff08125M\u30011.3B\uff09\u57286\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5185\u5b58\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1 FO \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf ZO\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u663e\u5b58\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a\u7ea6 3.7\u00d7\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u843d\u540e FO \u57fa\u7ebf 0.20%\u20134.23%\uff0c\u5728\u6bd4 ZO \u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7ea6 15.55% \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5c06\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316LLMs\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u597d\u7ed1\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff08\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u7684Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS)\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u626d\u66f2\uff1b\u5f15\u5165PFQABench\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eFPPS\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFPPS\u8fd9\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u626d\u66f2\uff1b\u5efa\u7acbPFQABench\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM backbone \u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "FPPS\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1bPFQABench\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0cFPPS\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406-time\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0cPFQABench\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines.

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "SGD \u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63ed\u793a\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5b58\u5728\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u671f\uff0cSGD \u566a\u58f0\u5c06\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u9762\u91cd\u5851\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\u80fd\u5792\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u8c37\u8dc3\u8fc1\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5ef6\u7f13\u51bb\u7ed3\u5e76\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a SGD \u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06 SGD \u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u5792\u4e0e\u8de8\u8c37\u8dc3\u8fc1\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u77ac\u6001\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cSGD \u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u65ad\u4ece\u5c16\u9510\u8c37\u9003\u9038\u5e76\u5411\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u660e\u566a\u58f0\u91cd\u5851\u52bf\u51fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u66f4\u6709\u5229\uff0c3) \u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u5792\u589e\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u8c37\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u56f0\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u76c6\u5730\uff1b4) \u589e\u5927 SGD \u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain.

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL.

To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family.

Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance.

REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "A self-reflection framework improves interpretability in graph learning on the Spurious-Motif benchmark by iteratively re-evaluating node/edge importance predictions and using feedback to fine-tune the model.", "motivation": "The Spurious-Motif benchmark imposes strong spurious correlations that obscure true structural signals; existing interpretable graph methods struggle to distinguish genuine structure from spurious patterns.

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation.

In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u591aKPI\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5229\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff08\u4ec5100\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u5728\u591aKPIs\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u6b64\u524d\u4ec5\u805a\u7126\u603b\u65f6\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6b64\u524dLLM\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5229\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u603b\u65f6\u957f\u4e0e\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d1\u751f\u4e24\u9879KPI\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff08100\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bLLM\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9636\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u590d\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u5728\u591aKPI\u573a\u666f\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u591aKPIs\u573a\u666f\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs.

Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Self-augmented mixture-of-experts for QoS prediction with iterative refinement; partially masking predictions feeds back for improved imputation under sparse user-service interactions; demonstrates superiority over baselines.", "motivation": "QoS prediction suffers from extreme sparsity of user-service interactions.

We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content.

To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals.

While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance. Moreover, the gains from multilingual training and testing highlight the dataset's potential for building effective multilingual fact-checking pipelines without relying on machine translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30MultiCaption\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u58f0\u660e\u77db\u76fe\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709NLI\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u67e5\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u58f0\u79f0\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b11,088\u6761\u89c6\u89c9\u58f0\u660e\u3001\u8986\u76d664\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u58f0\u660e\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u77db\u76fe\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "MultiCaption\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6NLI\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u624d\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u907f\u514d\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u771f\u6b63\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u4ec5\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0cDP-SFT \u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u6570\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u975e\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\uff1a\u9636\u6bb5\u4e00\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u9636\u6bb5\u4e8c\u5c06\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165 DP \u566a\u58f0\u540e\u518d\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDP-SFT \u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684 DP \u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e DP \u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DP-SFT \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 DP \u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u5f0f DP \u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients.

While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \\textbf{44\\%}, \\textbf{54\\%}, and \\textbf{31\\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings.

A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties.

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete.

Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices.

Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $\u03ba$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $\u03ba$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt\u03ba m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrt\u03ba$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(\u03ba^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $\u03ba^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLanczos\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Lanczos Iteration \u4e0e Lanczos Push\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8fd1\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u03ba\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u4e2d\u62b5\u6297\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u03ba\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u6162\u6216\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdLanczos\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aLanczos Iteration\uff08\u5168\u5c40\uff0c\u8fd1\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6~O~(\u221a\u03ba m)\uff09\u4e0eLanczos Push\uff08\u5c40\u90e8\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6~O~(\u03ba^{2.75})\uff0c\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6210\u7acb\uff09\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u516b\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Lanczos Iteration\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eSOTA\u5168\u5c40\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u83b7\u5f97\u7ea6\u221a\u03ba\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff1bLanczos Push\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eSOTA\u5c40\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u03ba\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u03ba^{0.25}\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLanczos\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u62b5\u6297\u8ddd\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u03ba\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\u3002"}}

We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation.

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728 drafting \u60a3\u8005\u95e8\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u9700\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u533b\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06LLMs\u5f15\u5165\u60a3\u8005-\u533b\u751f\u6c9f\u901a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u8282\u7701\u533b\u751f\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u8981\u7d20\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e34\u5e8a\u56de\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u8981\u7d20\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5c42\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u751f\u5bf9LLM\u8349\u62df\u56de\u590d\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u53d1\u5e03\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u4e0e\u5546\u7528LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u9002\u914d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1bLLMs\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u80fd\u8349\u62df\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4e3b\u9898\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u4e3a\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u63d0\u95ee\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5c06LLMs\u9010\u4e2a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u60a3\u8005-\u533b\u751f\u6c9f\u901a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities.

However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences.

Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ.

We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: \"Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?\", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\u0394\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u7ebf\u6027\u5b58\u50a8\u5f71\u54cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u672a\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u77e5\u6653\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa SyntHal \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a6 \u6761\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c6000 \u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f53\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 \u0394cos \u8861\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5404\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e \u0394cos \u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570 r \u5728 0.78-0.82 \u4e4b\u95f4\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u7ebf\u6027 vs \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b58\u50a8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA) \u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b LoRA \u7684\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1a\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u672c\u5730\u79c1\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u79c1\u6709\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6a21\u5757\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728 GLUE \u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u516c\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "FL \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cLLM \u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\uff08\u5982 LoRA\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b58\u5728\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u805a\u5408\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5f3a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u79e9\u8981\u4e48\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u6a21 decomposition\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u79c1\u6709\u3002\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4ec5\u805a\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u4e0d\u53c2\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408 GLUE \u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728 GLUE \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSDFLoRA \u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u8054\u90a6 LoRA \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u89e3\uff0cSDFLoRA \u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u805a\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs.

Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 \"disagreement\" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder.

However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data.

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPREAD \u5728 RAG \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u54cd\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff08RSD\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 DLM \u7684\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728 DLM \u4e0e RAG \u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u3002RSD \u5bfc\u81f4\u56de\u7b54\u9010\u6b65\u504f\u79bb\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SPREAD \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a SPREAD \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236 RSD\uff0c\u5728 RAG \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6539\u5584 DLM \u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SPREAD \u4e3a\u5728 RAG \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528 DLM \u7684\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation.

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes.

Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models", "comment": "Accepted at TMLR. Code: https://github.com/rarazafin/score_diffusion_ensemble", "summary": "Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).", "AI": {"tldr": "Ensembling diffusion models improves objective losses (score-matching loss, likelihood) but does not reliably boost perceptual quality (FID) on image data; results are robust across aggregation rules and evaluation settings; in tabular data, one aggregation strategy outperforms others; theoretical analysis clarifies how summing score models relates to ensembling and guidance.", "motivation": "To determine whether ensembling unconditional score-based diffusion models yields tangible benefits for generative modeling, particularly for perceptual quality, and to understand why objective improvements may not translate to better perceptual metrics.", "method": "Empirical study applying Deep Ensembles and Monte Carlo Dropout to diffusion score models on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ, testing various aggregation rules; evaluation uses FID and other perceptual metrics; investigation into the link between score estimation and image quality; extension to tabular data using random forests; theoretical analysis of score model summation and implications for model composition (e.g., guidance).", "result": "Ensembling improves score-matching loss and model likelihood but does not consistently improve perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets; results hold across multiple aggregation rules and datasets (CIFAR-10, FFHQ); for tabular data, random forests reveal a single aggregation strategy outperforms others; theoretical results offer insights into why summing score models behaves as it does, informing ensembling and guidance-related techniques.", "conclusion": "Ensembling diffusion models yields limited or inconsistent gains for perceptual quality despite objective improvements; the findings motivate rethinking ensemble design for generative models and highlight the need for theory on score-model combination and guidance methods to align objective metrics with perceptual quality."}}

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRKV introduces low-rank KV adaptation for multi-head attention, reducing KV cache memory by sharing a full-rank KV projection with per-head low-rank residuals.
