### [1] [BioACE: An Automated Framework for Biomedical Answer and Citation Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04982)
*Deepak Gupta,Davis Bartels,Dina Demner-Fuhsman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioACE是一个自动评估生物医学问答答案及其引用的框架，通过考虑完整性、正确性、精确率和召回率来评估答案，并利用自然语言推断和预训练语言模型来评估引用的质量，以期与人类评估结果保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的生物医学问题的答案及其引用的质量至关重要，因为这涉及到科学文献的一致性和复杂的医学术语，使得现有评估方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出BioACE自动框架，从完整性、正确性、精确率和召回率四个方面评估答案，并探索了自然语言推断（NLI）、预训练语言模型和LLMs等方法评估引文质量。

Result: 通过大量实验评估了BioACE各组成部分与人类评估的相关性，并确定了在BioACE评估包中用于生物医学答案和引文评估的最佳方法。

Conclusion: BioACE提供了一套自动化方法来评估生物医学问答的答案和引用质量，实验证明其有效性并与人类评估结果保持一致。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

### [2] [Capacity Constraints and the Multilingual Penalty for Lexical Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05035)
*Sean Trott,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上表现不如单语模型，这可能归因于容量限制。研究量化了这种“多语言惩罚”，并发现表示、注意力机制和词汇限制都对多语言模型产生了影响，这些因素共同解释了性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上的“多语言惩罚”，并探讨其潜在的容量限制因素。

Method: 使用包含英语和西班牙语歧义词的人类相关性判断的受控数据集，比较单语和多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上的表现。分析了表示、注意力机制和词汇限制三方面因素对性能的影响。

Result: 多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上表现持续不如单语模型。研究发现多语言模型在表示、注意力和词汇限制方面均存在不足，且这些因素能够解释其性能下降的原因。

Conclusion: 多语言语言模型确实存在多种容量限制，这些限制与其词汇歧义消除性能的下降相关。

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

### [3] [Locas: Your Models are Principled Initializers of Locally-Supported Parametric Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05085)
*Sidi Lu,Zhenwen Liang,Dongyang Ma,Yan Wang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Locas是一种参数化内存，可灵活地与模型参数分离或合并，支持高效的持续学习，并在语言建模和对话问答任务中有效存储和利用历史上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在测试时训练（test-time-training）和持续学习场景中，为模型提供一种可灵活管理的参数化内存，以存储和利用历史信息，同时最小化灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出Locas，一种在结构上模仿Transformer中FFN块的参数化内存。Locas有两个主要变体：一种基于两层MLP，具有清晰的理论保证；另一种模仿SOTA LLM的GLU-FFN结构，易于集成到现有模型中。通过重用模型参数、激活或梯度来对Locas进行恰当的初始化，以实现快速收敛、改进泛化能力和防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: Locas-GLU在PG-19语言建模和LoCoMo对话问答任务上进行了验证。在最低0.02%的额外参数情况下，Locas-GLU能够存储历史上下文信息，并保持较小的上下文窗口。通过MMLU评估，Locas在存储整个书籍信息后，对模型现有知识的灾难性遗忘最小化。

Conclusion: Locas是一种有效的参数化内存机制，能够以最小的灾难性遗忘将历史上下文永久化为参数化知识，并在语言建模和长上下文问答任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

### [4] [Data Kernel Perspective Space Performance Guarantees for Synthetic Data from Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05106)
*Michael Browder,Kevin Duh,J. David Harris,Vince Lyzinski,Paul McNamee,Youngser Park,Carey E. Priebe,Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用数据核函数视角空间（DKPS）来分析和保证Transformer模型（尤其是LLM）生成合成数据的质量，以解决标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型（特别是LLM）常用于通过生成合成数据来缓解标注数据稀缺问题，但其黑箱性质使得合成数据属性难以预测，导致工程师常依赖调整LLM的温度参数来优化模型性能。

Method: 提出数据核函数视角空间（DKPS）模型，进行数学推导，并证明其能为Transformer模型输出提供性能保证。将DKPS的性能保证应用于分析使用对比偏好优化（CPO）训练的下游任务（如神经机器翻译模型或LLM）的性能。

Result: DKPS为Transformer模型生成合成数据的质量提供了数学分析基础和统计保证，并能阐明下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: DKPS为理解和改进以LLM为基础的合成数据生成过程提供了理论框架，有助于解决数据稀缺问题并提高语言技术模型的性能。

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

### [5] [Multilingual Extraction and Recognition of Implicit Discourse Relations in Speech and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05107)
*Ahmed Ruby,Christian Hardmeier,Sara Stymne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Implicit discourse relation classification is improved by a multimodal approach using text and audio, especially for low-resource languages, by constructing a multilingual dataset and using Qwen2-Audio for joint modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit discourse relation classification is challenging due to the need to infer meaning from context, which is not always captured by text alone, and contextual cues can vary across modalities and languages. This paper addresses the need for multilingual and multimodal datasets and models for this task, particularly for distantly related and unrelated language pairs.

Method: A multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations was constructed for English, French, and Spanish using an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs. A multimodal classification approach was proposed, integrating textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio for joint modeling of text and audio across languages.

Result: The multimodal approach integrating text and audio enhanced performance compared to text-only or audio-only models. Cross-lingual transfer significantly improved performance for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal information (text and audio) and leveraging cross-lingual transfer are effective strategies for improving implicit discourse relation classification, especially in multilingual and low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

### [6] [Among Us: Measuring and Mitigating Malicious Contributions in Model Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05176)
*Ziyuan Yang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在多模型协作系统中，恶意模型会严重降低模型性能，尤其是在推理和安全领域。提出的缓解策略可以恢复大部分性能，但完全抵抗恶意模型仍是开放性研究问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在多模型协作系统中，潜在的恶意模型对系统安全性的影响，并提出缓解策略。

Method: 工程化四类恶意语言模型，并将其集成到四种流行的模型协作系统中，在10个数据集上进行评估。随后，提出使用外部监督者来监控模型协作并禁用/屏蔽恶意模型。

Result: 恶意模型平均导致推理和安全领域性能分别下降7.12%和7.94%。所提出的缓解策略平均恢复了95.31%的初始性能。

Conclusion: 恶意模型对多模型协作系统构成严重安全风险。虽然提出的缓解策略能有效恢复大部分性能，但要实现对恶意模型的完全抵抗，仍需进一步的研究。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

### [7] [The Single-Multi Evolution Loop for Self-Improving Model Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05182)
*Shangbin Feng,Kishan Panaganti,Yulia Tsvetkov,Wenhao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将模型协作模式提炼到单个模型中，并在推理时仅使用该提炼后的模型，来提高效率并保留协作的优势。通过单-多模型进化循环，模型可以不断进化和自我改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合多种语言模型的优势，同时降低加载多个模型的成本。

Method: 将模型协作模式提炼到单个模型中，并通过单-多模型进化循环不断改进模型。

Result: 个体模型平均提升8.0%，协作系统平均提升14.9%，进化后的模型优于现有的进化人工智能方法。

Conclusion: 单-多模型进化循环可以有效提升模型性能，并且具有良好的适应性和解决复杂问题的能力。

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

### [8] [Are Open-Weight LLMs Ready for Social Media Moderation? A Comparative Study on Bluesky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05189)
*Hsuan-Yu Chou,Wajiha Naveed,Shuyan Zhou,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了开源大型语言模型（LLMs）在社交媒体内容审核中的能力，发现它们的表现与专有LLMs相当，并且可以在普通硬件上实现隐私保护的内容审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网访问的扩展和有害内容的增加，对有效的内容审核的需求日益增长。虽然研究表明大型语言模型（LLMs）可用于内容审核，但开源LLMs的实际表现仍不确定。

Method: 评估了七种最先进的模型（四种专有，三种开源），使用Bluesky的真实帖子、Bluesky审核服务决策以及两位作者的注释。分析了模型的敏感性、特异性，并识别了人类审核员和LLMs之间的一致性。

Result: 开源LLMs在敏感性（81%--97%）和特异性（91%--100%）方面与专有LLMs（72%--98%，93%--99%）有显著重叠。在检测粗鲁言论时，特异性超过敏感性；在检测不宽容和威胁时，则相反。研究还识别了人类审核员和LLMs之间的一致性。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs有能力支持在消费级硬件上进行隐私保护的内容审核，并为设计平衡社区价值观和用户偏好的审核系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

### [9] [Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205)
*Kenichiro Ando,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM在添加引文时，其行为与人类偏好存在偏差，尤其是在引用需要引文的内容和数字/包含人名内容方面。通过直接偏好优化（DPO）可以校准模型行为以更好地匹配人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM如何识别引文价值以及如何控制这一过程，并研究LLM当前的引用行为与人类偏好的一致性。

Method: 构建数据集，将网页文本分为八种引文动机类型，并对所有类型组合进行配对引用偏好评估，以捕捉细微差别。通过直接偏好优化（DPO）实验来校准模型行为。

Result: 人类最常为医学文本寻求引文，更强的模型也表现出类似倾向。模型比人类更倾向于引用明确标记需要引文的内容（高出27%），这降低了对齐准确性。模型在引用包含数字（低22.6%）和人名（低20.1%）的句子方面不如人类。DPO实验表明模型行为可以被校准以更好地匹配人类偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在引用行为上与人类存在偏差，但可以通过DPO等方法进行校准，以提高引文推荐的准确性和可靠性。本研究为进一步研究LLM的引用偏好奠定了基础。

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

### [10] [Quantifying the Knowledge Proximity Between Academic and Industry Research: An Entity and Semantic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05211)
*Hongye Zhao,Yi Zhao,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study quantifies academia-industry co-evolution using fine-grained entities and semantic analysis, revealing increasing knowledge proximity, especially after technological changes, and academia's diminishing dominance during paradigm shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on academia-industry knowledge proximity rely on macro indicators, lacking fine-grained analysis of knowledge units, which hinders understanding of collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency.

Method: Quantifies co-evolution through fine-grained entities (using pre-trained models, cosine similarity, complex network analysis) and semantic space (using unsupervised contrastive learning for textual similarities). Examines correlations between knowledge flows and similarity using citation patterns.

Result: Knowledge proximity between academia and industry increases, particularly after technological change, indicating bidirectional adaptation. Academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Conclusion: The study provides textual evidence of academia-industry co-evolution, showing increasing knowledge proximity and shifts in knowledge dominance during technological transitions.

Abstract: The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts. The dataset and code for this paper can be accessed at https://github.com/tinierZhao/Academic-Industrial-associations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bagpiper是一个8B的音频基础模型，它通过丰富的自然语言描述（包含转录、音频事件等概念）来理解音频信号，实现了对音频的统一理解和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频基础模型依赖于僵化的、特定任务的监督，只处理音频的孤立因素，而非整体。而人类的智能以整体方式处理音频，将物理信号与抽象认知概念无缝连接以执行复杂任务。

Method: Bagpiper通过在大规模语料库（600B tokens）上进行预训练，建立原始音频与高层概念空间之间的双向映射。在微调时，采用“先描述，后处理”的工作流程，模拟中间的认知推理步骤，无需特定任务的先验知识即可解决各种任务。

Result: Bagpiper在MMAU和AIRBench上优于Qwen-2.5-Omni，在音频理解方面表现出色。在生成质量方面，Bagpiper超越了CosyVoice3和TangoFlux，能够合成语音、音乐和音效的任意组合。

Conclusion: Bagpiper是首批实现通用音频统一理解与生成工作的模型之一。

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

*Zhilin Liang,Yuxiang Wang,Zimu Zhou,Hainan Zhang,Boyi Liu,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedMosaic通过使用多文档适配器和选择性聚合来优化参数化RAG，解决了联邦RAG的存储和通信开销问题，并在不共享原始文档的情况下提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法假设数据集中存在一个中心化的语料库，这在隐私敏感的领域是不可行的，因为知识通常是孤立的。为了解决这个问题，需要一种联邦RAG（FedRAG）方法，允许中央LLM服务器与分布式数据孤岛协作，而无需共享原始文档。

Method: FedMosaic框架采用了参数化RAG方法，将文档编码为轻量级适配器，并与冻结的LLM合并。为了解决高存储和通信开销问题，FedMosaic将语义相关的文档聚合成多文档适配器，并使用文档特定的掩码来减少开销并保持特异性。为了解决破坏性聚合问题，FedMosaic执行选择性适配器聚合，仅合并相关性对齐且无冲突的适配器。

Result: FedMosaic在四个类别的平均准确率比最先进的方法高10.9%，同时将存储成本降低了78.8%至86.3%，通信成本降低了91.4%，并且在整个过程中从未共享原始文档。

Conclusion: FedMosaic是第一个基于参数化适配器的联邦RAG框架，它通过聚类文档和选择性聚合解决了现有FedRAG方法的挑战，在保持数据隐私的同时显著提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.

Motivation: 版权法性质复杂，将版权侵权与合规性视为证据发现过程，而非静态分类任务。

Method: 整合了内容召回测试、释义相似度分析、强制越狱探测和遗忘验证等多种检测范式，在一个统一且可扩展的框架内。通过交互式提示、响应收集和迭代工作流。

Result: 能够系统地审计逐字记忆和释义泄露，即使在黑盒访问的情况下也能支持LLM版权风险的负责任部署和透明评估。

Conclusion: Copyright Detective 是首个用于检测、分析和可视化LLM输出中潜在版权风险的交互式取证系统。

Abstract: We present Copyright Detective, the first interactive forensic system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs. The system treats copyright infringement versus compliance as an evidence discovery process rather than a static classification task due to the complex nature of copyright law. It integrates multiple detection paradigms, including content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification, within a unified and extensible framework. Through interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows, our system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks even with black-box access.

Motivation: RoPE是LLM上下文扩展的关键，现有的方法在OOD缓解和语义建模两个方向上进行研究，但目标不统一。本文旨在统一RoPE扩展到长上下文的两个目标。

Method: 提出CoPE，通过软裁剪RoPE的低频分量来统一OOD缓解和语义建模的目标。

Result: CoPE在长上下文（最高256k）的实验中取得了显著的性能提升，验证了理论分析，并成为长度泛化的新SOTA。

Conclusion: CoPE通过软裁剪RoPE的低频分量，能够有效缓解OOD问题，优化语义信号，并防止硬裁剪引入的光谱泄漏，在长上下文扩展方面取得了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

TL;DR: RLVR在LLM和VLM上展现了强大的推理能力，但响应长度变化模式不一。本文分析了RLVR算法的组成部分，提出了长度无偏序列策略优化（LUSPO）算法，解决了GSPO中的长度偏见问题，并在数学和多模态推理任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Motivation: 分析RLVR算法中响应长度变化模式的根本原因，并提出新的优化算法。

Method: 对主流RLVR算法的组成部分进行理论分析，并提出长度无偏序列策略优化（LUSPO）算法，以解决响应长度偏见问题。

Result: LUSPO算法在数学推理和多模态推理基准测试中，相比GRPO和GSPO等现有方法，始终能取得更优越的性能。

Conclusion: LUSPO是一种新颖的、最先进的优化策略，能够有效提升LLM和VLM在复杂推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: LLMs在MAS中的应用急需一个统一的科学框架来克服经验主义的局限，该框架应侧重于可衡量的协作增益而非资源累积，并通过因素归因范式指导系统优化，最终推动集体智能的科学发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统（MAS）在大型语言模型（LLMs）的驱动下虽然能力显著增强，但其发展仍严重依赖经验试错，缺乏系统性优化的科学框架，主要瓶颈在于因素归因的模糊性，即缺乏结构化的因素分类和区分真正协作增益与资源累积的统一指标。

Method: 提出建立协作增益指标($Γ$)作为科学标准，以分离纯粹的增益和预算的增加。利用$Γ$，提出一个因素归因范式，用于系统地识别驱动协作的因素。构建一个系统的MAS因素库，将设计空间划分为控制层预设和信息层动态。

Result: 通过引入协作增益指标($Γ$)和因素归因范式，以及MAS因素库，实现了从盲目实验到严谨科学的转变，为集体人工智能的科学发展铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 该研究主张通过一个集成框架，采用设计科学的方法，建立协作增益指标($Γ$)，并实施因素归因范式，以克服当前MAS研究中存在的经验主义和归因模糊性问题，最终目标是建立一个真正的集体人工智能科学。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

TL;DR: LLMs在知识密集型领域存在局限性，如幻觉、信息过时和可解释性差。基于文本的检索增强生成（RAG）有助于将模型输出 grounding 到外部源，但难以进行多跳推理。知识图谱（KGs）支持精确、可解释的查询，但需要查询语言知识。本研究引入了一个交互式框架，其中LLMs生成并解释Cypher图查询，用户通过自然语言迭代优化这些查询。该框架应用于真实KG，提高了对复杂数据集的可访问性，同时保持了事实准确性和语义严谨性，并深入了解了模型在不同领域的性能变化。核心定量评估是在一个合成电影KG上进行的90个查询基准测试，测量了多个LLMs的查询解释质量和故障检测能力，并辅以在Hyena KG和MaRDI KG上的两次小型真实查询生成实验。

Motivation: 解决LLMs在知识密集型领域存在局限性，如幻觉、信息过时和可解释性差，以及文本RAG在多跳推理方面的不足，和知识图谱需要查询语言知识的问题。

Method: 提出一个交互式框架，让LLMs生成并解释Cypher图查询，用户通过自然语言迭代优化查询。

Result: 在合成电影KG、Hyena KG和MaRDI KG上进行了基准测试和实验，评估了查询解释质量和故障检测能力，证明了框架在提高复杂数据集可访问性、保持事实准确性和语义严谨性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过LLM生成的、用户可迭代优化的Cypher查询，提高了知识图谱的可访问性和LLM在知识密集型任务中的准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

TL;DR: 大型模型（LRM）通过长推理链实现高性能，但推理成本高且常产生冗余推理。小型模型（SLM）效率高，但在多步推理任务中表现不佳。现有协作方法常导致模仿，产生冗长且无错误纠正的推理。我们提出了一种名为 MentorCollab 的推理时协作方法，其中 LRM 选择性地、稀疏地指导 SLM，而不是接管生成。在随机抽样的 token 位置，我们探测两个模型之间的分歧，并使用一个轻量级验证器来决定 SLM 是应遵循其导师的简短前瞻性片段，还是自行继续。在 15 个 SLM-LRM 对和 3 个领域（数学推理、常识推理和常识推理）的实验中，我们的方法在 12 种设置中提高了性能，平均提高了 3.0%，最高提高了 8.0%，同时平均仅采用 18.4% 的 token 由昂贵的导师模型生成。我们发现简短的片段和选择性探测足以实现有效的协作。我们的结果表明，选择性推理时指导可以在没有大量推理开销的情况下恢复大型模型的推理能力。

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRM）虽然性能强大，但推理成本高且容易产生冗余，而小型模型（SLM）效率高但难以胜任多步推理任务。现有的协作方法往往鼓励模仿，导致推理冗长且缺乏有效的错误纠正。

Method: 提出了一种名为 MentorCollab 的推理时协作方法。在该方法中，LRM 选择性且稀疏地指导 SLM，而不是完全控制生成过程。在随机抽样的 token 位置，探测 LRM 和 SLM 之间的推理分歧，并使用一个轻量级验证器来判断 SLM 是否应该采纳 LRM 提供的简短前瞻性片段，或者继续自行生成。

Result: 在 15 个 SLM-LRM 模型对和数学推理、常识推理、常识推理三个领域进行了实验。结果显示，MentorCollab 在 12 种设置下均有性能提升，平均性能提升 3.0%，最高可达 8.0%。同时，采用的由昂贵的 LRM 生成的 token 比例平均仅为 18.4%。

Conclusion: 选择性地在推理时进行指导，并结合简短的片段和选择性探测，足以实现有效的协作。该方法可以在不显著增加推理开销的情况下，恢复大型模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

TL;DR: 语言模型（LM）在没有显式提供的情况下，能够隐式地编码字符级信息，但其潜在机制仍有待探索。本研究通过比较在控制设置（如指定预训练数据集或分词器）和标准设置下训练的模型，来分析LM如何获得字符级知识。我们将影响因素分为与分词无关的因素和与分词相关的因素。研究发现，合并规则和拼写约束是分词相关的关键因素，而子字符串的语义关联和句法信息是与分词无关的关键因素。

Motivation: 探究语言模型（LM）在未显式训练的情况下，如何获得字符级信息编码能力的潜在机制。

Method: 通过比较在控制设置（指定预训练数据集或分词器）和标准设置下训练的LM，分析影响因素。将因素分为与分词无关和分词相关的两类。

Result: 合并规则和拼写约束是分词相关的关键因素；子字符串的语义关联和句法信息是与分词无关的关键因素。

Conclusion: 分词相关的因素（合并规则、拼写约束）和与分词无关的因素（子字符串语义关联、句法信息）共同作用，促使语言模型获得字符级信息的编码能力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is state-of-the-art for aligning LLMs on reasoning tasks, but its reliance on Best-of-N sampling with large N diminishes returns and causes policy collapse in mathematical reasoning. We propose PACE (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which uses a generation-based corrective strategy with small N to synthesize preference pairs from failed explorations. PACE outperforms DPO-R1 (N=16) using 1/5 compute and shows better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) relies on Best-of-N sampling (large N) for aligning LLMs on reasoning tasks. This paper challenges the hypothesis that larger N always yields better results, revealing diminishing returns and policy collapse in mathematical reasoning due to amplified verifier noise and distribution shifts.

Method: The paper proposes PACE (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), a method that replaces Best-of-N sampling with a generation-based corrective strategy. PACE operates with a minimal budget (2<N<3) and synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations, contrasting with the brute-force mining of standard DPO.

Result: PACE outperforms standard DPO-R1 (N=16) in mathematical reasoning tasks, achieving superior results while utilizing only approximately 1/5 of the computational resources. Additionally, PACE demonstrates enhanced robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Conclusion: PACE offers a more efficient and robust approach to aligning LLMs for reasoning tasks compared to standard DPO methods that rely on aggressive exploration. By employing a corrective strategy with a minimal sampling budget, PACE effectively synthesizes high-quality preference data, leading to improved performance and resilience.

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Motivation: 现有LLM在医学应用中存在英语中心化问题，限制了其在低资源语言中的可靠性，但其原因不明。本研究旨在通过跨语言实证分析，探究LLM在阿拉伯语和英语医学问答任务上的性能差异及其潜在原因。

Method: 对LLM在阿拉伯语和英语医学问答任务上的表现进行跨语言实证分析，包括进行词元化分析和可靠性分析。

Result: 研究发现，LLM在阿拉伯语和英语医学问答任务上存在持续的语言驱动性能差距，且该差距随任务复杂度的增加而加剧。词元化分析揭示了阿拉伯语医学文本在结构上存在碎片化问题，而可靠性分析表明，模型报告的置信度和解释与其正确性之间存在有限的相关性。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语医学文本的词元化问题和模型置信度与正确率的相关性较低是导致LLM在阿拉伯语医学问答任务上性能下降的原因。这表明在医学领域应用LLM时，需要采取语言感知的设��和评估策略，以确保其在不同语言环境下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL方法在处理复杂推理、领域知识和假设查询方面存在不足，并且在企业部署成本高昂。因此，需要一种能够解决这些问题并实现轻量化部署的框架。

Method: IESR框架包含三个主要部分：（1）利用LLM进行关键信息理解和模式链接，并将数学计算与SQL生成分离开；（2）整合基于MCTS和多数投票的多路径推理机制；（3）引入具有判别器模型的轨迹一致性验证模块，以确保准确性和一致性。

Result: IESR在LogicCat（24.28 EX）和Archer（37.28 EX）数据集上取得了最先进的性能，且仅使用了轻量级模型，无需进行微调。实验还揭示了当前代码生成模型在物理知识、数学计算和常识推理方面存在偏差和不足。

Conclusion: IESR框架能够有效地处理复杂的文本到SQL任务，并在性能和效率方面优于现有方法，同时为未来的研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

Motivation: 现有预训练大型语言模型（LLM）的计算成本高昂，阻碍了快速发展。本研究旨在探索是否可以利用现有的、预训练好的小型模型来加速更大模型的训练。

Method: 提出“晚-早训练”（LET）范式，核心思想是在早期训练阶段，利用预训练模型（后期训练阶段）的表示来指导目标大型语言模型的早期层。该范式包含两个关键机制：晚-早步骤学习和晚-早层学习。

Result: LET范式显著加速了训练收敛，并能有效提升语言建模能力和下游任务性能。在1.4B和7B参数模型上的实验表明，LET方法在训练1.4B LLM时，与标准训练相比，速度最高可提升1.6倍，下游任务准确率提高近5%，即使目标模型参数量是预训练模型的10倍。

Conclusion: LET范式能够有效地利用预训练的小型模型来加速大型模型的训练，并提高其性能，解决了现有LLM训练成本高昂的问题。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

TL;DR: 现有的基于引文的自动评价指标在语法纠错（GEC）评估中效果不佳，因为它们无法有效捕捉到句子中的细微编辑差异。本文提出了一种名为 UOT-ERRANT 的新评价指标，该指标利用“编辑向量”和“不平衡最优传输”来衡量假设句和参考句之间在编辑上的相似度，特别关注 GEC 任务中的具体编辑操作，从而提高了评估性能，尤其是在流畅性方面。此外，该方法具有良好的可解释性，其传输计划可以被视为一种软编辑对齐，有助于分析 GEC 系统。

Motivation: 现有的基于引文的自动评价指标（如 BERTScore）在语法纠错（GEC）评估中效果不佳，因为它们主要衡量句子间的整体相似度，而忽略了 GEC 任务中细微的编辑差异，特别是当源句子中的许多词在假设句和参考句中保持不变时。需要一种更关注编辑操作本身的评价方法。

Method: 提出“编辑向量”来表示 GEC 中的编辑操作。引入一种名为 UOT-ERRANT 的新评价指标，该指标利用不平衡最优传输（unbalanced optimal transport）来计算编辑向量从假设句到参考句的传输成本，以此衡量编辑上的相似度。通过 SEEDA 元评估进行实验。

Result: UOT-ERRANT 在 GEC 评估中提高了评价性能，尤其是在 +Fluency（流畅性）领域，该领域包含大量编辑操作。此外，UOT-ERRANT 具有高度可解释性，其传输计划可以被解释为软编辑对齐。

Conclusion: UOT-ERRANT 是一种有效且可解释的 GEC 评价指标，它通过关注编辑操作本身来克服现有基于引文的指标的局限性，能够更好地用于系统排名和 GEC 系统分析。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的视觉-语言模型（VLM）基准测试未能充分评估模型在非西方文化背景下，尤其是在阿拉伯语及其方言中，接受不符合事实但具有文化合理性解释的能力。我们提出了M2CQA，一个包含17个中东和北非国家图像的多模态基准测试，并配有真伪对比陈述。我们还引入了反事实幻觉率（CFHR）指标来衡量模型在正确回答真实陈述的前提下接受虚假陈述的程度。实验结果表明，VLM在阿拉伯语和方言中的CFHR显著升高，即使在真实陈述上的准确率保持不变。此外，“先推理”的提示策略会增加幻觉，而“先回答后论证”的策略则能提高鲁棒性。

Motivation: 评估和改进视觉-语言模型（VLM）在处理非西方文化背景下的幻觉问题，特别是在阿拉伯语及其方言中的表现。

Method: 创建了一个名为M2CQA的多模态基准测试，包含来自17个中东和北非国家的图像，并配有真/伪对比陈述（涵盖英语、阿拉伯语及方言）。提出了反事实幻觉率（CFHR）指标。在多种提示策略下评估了现有的VLM。

Result: 在M2CQA基准测试上，VLM在阿拉伯语（尤其是方言）中表现出更高的反事实幻觉率（CFHR），即使在正确回答真实陈述时也是如此。‘先推理’的提示策略会增加幻觉，而‘先回答后论证’的策略则能提高模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 现有的VLM在处理非西方文化（特别是中东和北非地区）的图像-文本时，存在显著的幻觉问题，尤其是在阿拉伯语及其方言中。M2CQA基准测试和CFHR指标为进一步研究和改进VLM的鲁棒性提供了重要资源。提示策略对模型的幻觉表现有显著影响。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的安全对齐机制通常作为潜在的内部状态存在，这模糊了模型本身的能力。本研究旨在从因果角度解决这一问题，将安全机制视为一个未被观测到的混淆变量。

Method: 提出了一种名为Causal Front-Door Adjustment Attack (CFA²) 的因果推断攻击框架。该框架利用了 Pearl 的前门准则来切断混淆关联，实现鲁棒的越狱。具体而言，研究人员使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）来剥离防御相关的特征，从而分离出核心任务意图。此外，他们将计算上成本高昂的边际化操作简化为低推理复杂度的确定性干预。

Result: 实验证明，CFA² 实现了最先进的攻击成功率，并对越狱过程提供了机制化解释。

Conclusion: CFA² 是一种有效的因果推断攻击方法，能够通过解耦安全机制与核心任务意图来成功越狱大型语言模型，同时提供了对越狱过程的机制化理解。

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: 所提出的跨架构合并框架能够有效地实现高资源模型到低资源模型的知识迁移，并在多种低资源场景下取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

TL;DR: RL-based post-training with GRPO improves LLMs on individual reasoning tasks, but multi-task adaptation leads to imbalanced performance. MT-GRPO addresses this by dynamically adapting task weights to optimize worst-task performance and using a ratio-preserving sampler for balanced gradients. Experiments show MT-GRPO outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy and achieves better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of LLMs requires reliable performance across diverse tasks, but standard multi-task adaptation of GRPO leads to imbalanced outcomes and distorted optimization signals due to variations in task gradients. This paper aims to address these issues to promote balanced progress and reliable performance across tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm. MT-GRPO features dynamic task weight adaptation to optimize worst-task performance and a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients align with these adapted weights.

Result: Experiments on 3-task and 9-task settings demonstrate that MT-GRPO consistently surpasses baselines in worst-task accuracy. Specifically, MT-GRPO shows absolute improvements of 16-28% and 6% on worst-task performance compared to standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Furthermore, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, indicating significantly improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MT-GRPO effectively addresses the challenges of multi-task adaptation in RL-based post-training for LLMs by dynamically balancing task optimization and ensuring gradient contributions are proportional to task importance. This leads to superior worst-task performance and improved training efficiency, making it a more reliable approach for real-world deployment across diverse tasks.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

Motivation: 现有LLM在个性化教育中的“一刀切”响应机制忽视了学生间的异质性，可能对弱势群体构成安全风险。现有的安全评估方法侧重于上下文无关的指标，无法捕捉同一响应对不同学生属性可能造成的差异化危害。

Method: 提出“学生定制化个性安全”概念，并基于教育理论构建了名为CASTLE的基准。该基准包含15种教育安全风险和14种学生属性，设计了风险敏感性、情感共情和学生匹配度三项评估指标，并构建了92,908个双语场景。

Conclusion: CASTLE基准和提出的评估指标能够有效揭示现有LLM在个性化安全保障方面的不足，强调了开发能够适应不同学生属性并提供个性化安全响应的LLM的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型如何表征土耳其语和现代希伯来语的复杂动词范式，重点关注分词策略如何影响其表征能力。

Method: 使用Blackbird Language Matrices任务和自然数据，在土耳其语和现代希伯来语上评估单语和多语Transformer模型在不同分词策略下的表现。

Result: 对于土耳其语，无论分词是原子的还是细粒度的子词单元，单语和多语模型都能成功。对于希伯来语，单语和多语模型表现不同，字符级分词的多语模型无法捕捉非黏着形态，而词缀感知的单语模型表现良好。在更具合成性的数据集上，所有模型的性能都有所提高。

Conclusion: 分词策略对Transformer模型表征复杂动词范式至关重要，尤其是在处理像希伯来语这样具有非黏着形态的语言时。词缀感知的分词方法对提高模型性能是有效的。

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally. The dataset is available in the supplementary material. An anonymized version of the dataset is available at: https://github.com/congboma/MedErrBench.

Conclusion: 所提出的神经元高效微调框架在MDMT任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 提出OmniMoE框架，包含向量级原子专家、共享的密集MLP分支、笛卡尔积路由器（将路由复杂度从O(N)降低到O(sqrt(N))）和专家中心调度（将内存查找转换为矩阵运算）。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，OmniMoE（1.7B激活参数）实现了50.9%的零样本准确率，优于现有粗粒度和细粒度MoE模型，并将推理延迟从73ms降低到6.7ms（10.9倍加速）。

Conclusion: 大规模细粒度MoE模型可以同时实现高精度和低延迟，OmniMoE通过系统-算法协同设计证明了这一点。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）的多跳问答系统存在效率低下、LLM调用频繁、token消耗高以及跨跳实体一致性不稳定等问题。

Method: CompactRAG框架包含两个阶段：1. 离线阶段：使用LLM一次性读取语料库，将其转换为原子化的问答知识库，将知识表示为最小的、细粒度的问答对。 2. 在线阶段：将复杂查询分解并重写以保持实体一致性，通过密集检索和基于RoBERTa的答案提取来解决。在推理过程中，LLM仅在开始时进行子问题分解和最后进行答案合成时调用两次，与推理跳数无关。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MuSiQue数据集上的实验表明，CompactRAG在保持竞争性准确率的同时，与迭代式RAG基线相比，显著降低了token消耗。

Conclusion: CompactRAG是一种成本效益高且实用的方法，用于在大型知识语料库上进行多跳推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

Motivation: Existing methods for long-context reasoning in LLMs struggle due to sparse, outcome-only rewards that inadequately guide complex deduction. This paper addresses the need for more effective guidance in long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis.

Method: The proposed LongR framework integrates a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism that interleaves reasoning with document consultation. It also incorporates a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of relevant documents.

Result: LongR achieved a 9% gain on LongBench v2, showed consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating efficiency in long-context navigation. It also enhanced performance across various RL algorithms like DAPO and GSPO. Analyses showed the impact of reasoning chain length and robustness against distractors.

Conclusion: LongR offers a unified framework that significantly enhances long-context performance in LLMs by addressing the limitations of sparse rewards through a "Think-and-Read" mechanism and a contextual density reward, showing broad applicability and robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

Motivation: 评估LLM检测器在捷克语环境中是否存在对非母语者的偏见，并探讨其有效性。

Method: 1. 比较捷克语母语者和非母语者文本的困惑度。 2. 检查三种不同类型的LLM检测器是否存在系统性偏见。 3. 评估不依赖困惑度的检测器性能。

Result: 捷克语非母语者文本的困惑度并不比母语者低。所检查的检测器没有表现出对非母语者的系统性偏见。不依赖困惑度的当代检测器运行有效。

Conclusion: LLM检测器在捷克语环境中对非母语者没有表现出系统性偏见，并且其有效性不依赖于困惑度指标。

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

Motivation: 现有智能体评估主要采用演绎范式，忽略了智能体从经验中自主发现潜在转移规律的能力，而这对于实现智能体的前瞻性和战略连贯性至关重要。

Method: 提出OdysseyArena评估框架，该框架侧重于长期、主动和归纳式交互。通过形式化和实例化四个基本元素，将抽象的转移动力学转化为具体的交互环境。基于此，建立了OdysseyArena-Lite用于标准化基准测试（包含120个任务），以及OdysseyArena-Challenge用于在极长的交互视野（超过200步）下测试智能体的稳定性。

Result: 在15个以上的主流大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，即使是最先进的模型在归纳场景下也表现出不足，这表明自主发现能力在大语言模型智能体发展中存在关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: 现有的大语言模型在自主发现潜在转移规律方面存在显著不足，这阻碍了它们在复杂环境中的长期规划和战略连贯性。OdysseyArena提供了一个新的评估范式，突显了这一关键挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

TL;DR: RRAttention通过一种新颖的头轮换（RR）采样策略，实现了动态稀疏注意力机制，将复杂度从O(L^2)降至O(L^2/S^2)，同时保持查询独立性并实现全局模式发现，在下游任务中实现了显著的加速和性能恢复。


<details>

Motivation: 二次复杂性是大型语言模型处理长上下文时的关键瓶颈，现有的动态稀疏注意力方法存在权衡取舍。

Method: 提出了一种名为RRAttention的新型动态稀疏注意力方法，该方法采用头轮换（RR）采样策略，在每个步长内跨注意力头旋转查询采样位置，并结合自适应Top-τ选择。

Result: RRAttention将复杂度从O(L^2)降低到O(L^2/S^2)，在HELMET和Video-MME基准测试中，计算一半的注意力块即可恢复超过99%的完全注意力性能，并在128K上下文长度下实现了2.4倍的加速。

Conclusion: RRAttention通过其新颖的RR采样策略，克服了现有动态稀疏注意力方法的局限性，在保持高效性的同时，实现了接近全注意力的性能。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

*Adrián Girón,Pablo Miralles,Javier Huertas-Tato,Sergio D'Antonio,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: hate speech detection is complex, so we created xList-Hate, a framework that breaks it down into checklist questions answered by LLMs, with results aggregated by a decision tree for better robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hate speech detection models struggle with the complexity and varying definitions of hate speech, leading to overfitting and poor robustness. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The paper introduces xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into concept-level questions. LLMs answer these questions independently, generating a binary diagnostic representation. A decision tree then aggregates these signals for transparent predictions.

Result: xList-Hate demonstrates improved cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift compared to zero-shot LLM classification and supervised fine-tuning. It also shows potential for reduced sensitivity to annotation inconsistencies and ambiguity, offering fine-grained interpretability.

Conclusion: Reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than direct classification, offers a more robust, explainable, and extensible solution for content moderation.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

TL;DR: 小型推理模型（SRM）对于资源受限环境中的链式思考（CoT）推理至关重要，但它们容易出现忠实性幻觉。现有的基于在线强化学习的缓解方法依赖于基于结果的奖励或粗粒度的CoT评估，这可能无意中强化了不忠实的推理。为解决这些局限性，我们提出了忠实度感知步级强化学习（FaithRL），通过显式的忠实度奖励和生成忠实前缀的对比信号的隐式截断重采样策略，引入了步级监督。FaithRL在多个SRM和开放域问答基准的实验表明，它能持续减少CoT和最终答案中的幻觉，从而实现更忠实、更可靠的推理。

Motivation: 小型推理模型（SRM）在资源受限环境下需要链式思考（CoT）推理能力，但它们容易产生忠实性幻觉，尤其是在推理中间步骤。现有的方法在最终答案正确时，可能无意中强化了不忠实的推理。

Method: 提出忠实度感知步级强化学习（FaithRL），引入了由过程奖励模型提供的显式忠实度奖励的步级监督，以及一种生成对比信号的隐式截断重采样策略。

Result: FaithRL 在多个 SRM 和开放域问答基准上进行了实验，结果表明该方法能够持续减少 CoT 和最终答案中的幻觉。

Conclusion: FaithRL 能够实现更忠实、更可靠的推理，有效解决了小型推理模型在资源受限环境下进行 CoT 推理时出现的忠实性幻觉问题。

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: KV-CoRE是一种基于SVD的kv-cache压缩方法，通过量化kv-cache的低秩可压缩性来评估压缩效果，并分析了模型、训练数据和语言覆盖度对可压缩性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自回归解码中依赖kv-cache来避免冗余计算，但随着上下文长度的增加，kv-cache的读写会迅速饱和GPU内存带宽。现有的kv-cache压缩方法大多忽略了kv-cache的数据依赖性和跨层变化。

Method: KV-CoRE（KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation）是一种基于SVD的方法，用于量化kv-cache的数据相关低秩可压缩性。该方法计算Frobenius范数下的最优低秩近似，并且由于其无梯度和增量特性，能够实现高效的数据集级、逐层评估。研究中还使用了归一化有效秩作为可压缩性度量。

Result: 研究分析了多种模型和数据集，涵盖了五个英语领域和十六种语言，发现了可压缩性与模型架构、训练数据和语言覆盖度之间的系统性关联。归一化有效秩与压缩过程中的性能下降密切相关。

Conclusion: KV-CoRE提供了一个原则性的评估框架和首个大规模的LLM kv-cache可压缩性基准，为动态、数据感知压缩和以数据为中心模型开发提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在多语言值 the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS) 语料库上进行包含价值判断的多项选择题测试时，会表现出语言依赖性行为，尤其是在指令微调模型中，这表明模型在不同语言下可能持有不同的价值观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多语言大型语言模型在回答涉及价值判断的多项选择题时，是否会因提问语言的不同而产生行为差异。

Method: 发布了一个包含8种欧洲语言、由人工翻译的MEVS语料库，并选取其中部分题目测试了三十余种不同规模、制造商和微调状态的多语言大型语言模型，同时控制了回答顺序、符号类型和尾部字符等提示变量。

Result: 研究发现，虽然规模较大且经过指令微调的模型在总体上表现出更高的一致性，但其回答的鲁棒性因问题而异。在某些多项选择题上，模型表现出完全的一致性，而在另一些问题上则分歧较大。所有一致且经过指令微调的模型似乎都表现出与语言相关的行为，但这仅发生在特定问题上。

Conclusion: 多语言大型语言模型在回答价值判断的多项选择题时，并非完全像理论上的多语者那样表现一致，而是可能表现出类似多个单语模型的行为，其回答会受到提问语言的影响，尤其是在特定问题上。指令微调似乎会加剧这种语言特定的行为，这值得进一步研究偏好微调的选择性影响。

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

Motivation: 长推理模型在多语言环境下存在不足，主要表现在非英语问题倾向于用英语推理，以及在强制使用问题语言时准确率大幅下降。这源于模型在多语言问题理解和多语言推理能力上的局限性。

Method: 提出TRIT（Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training）框架，一种自我改进的框架，将翻译训练集成到多语言推理中。该方法在没有外部反馈或额外多语言数据的情况下，联合提升多语言问题理解和响应生成能力。

Result: 在MMATH数据集上，TRIT相比多个基线模型平均提高了7个百分点，在提高答案正确性和语言一致性方面均有改善。此外，TRIT将跨语言问题对齐提高了10个百分点以上，并将数学问题和通用领域文本的翻译质量提高了高达8.4 COMET分（在FLORES-200数据集上）。

Conclusion: TRIT框架通过整合翻译训练，有效解决了长推理模型在多语言环境下的理解和推理瓶颈，显著提高了模型在多语言数学推理任务上的准确性和语言一致性，并对跨语言理解和翻译质量也产生了积极影响。

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

*Lizhuo Luo,Shenggui Li,Yonggang Wen,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) use block inference for better quality, but fixed schedules are suboptimal. This paper proposes Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) with a dynamic size and a tailored KV-cache mechanism (DSB Cache) to improve both generation quality and inference efficiency in dLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed block scheduling in dLLMs is suboptimal because it is agnostic to semantic difficulty, leading to premature commitments on uncertain positions and delays on easy positions near block boundaries. Dynamic adaptation to semantic difficulty is crucial for reliable and efficient inference.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of naive block scheduling. Additionally, it introduces DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism specifically designed for DSB to further improve efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that DSB combined with DSB Cache consistently enhances both the generation quality and inference efficiency of dLLMs.

Conclusion: Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) with its accompanying DSB Cache mechanism offers a more effective approach to block scheduling for diffusion large language models, improving both output quality and inference speed compared to traditional fixed scheduling methods.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

*Jian Chen,Yesheng Liang,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFlash通过使用轻量级块扩散模型进行并行草稿生成，实现了超过6倍的无损加速，比现有的EAGLE-3方法快2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归大语言模型（LLMs）推理延迟高且GPU利用率低，而现有的推测解码方法（如EAGLE-3）在草稿生成方面仍然是顺序的，限制了实际的加速效果。扩散LLMs虽然可以并行生成，但性能通常不如自回归模型。

Method: 提出了一种名为DFlash的推测解码框架，它使用一个轻量级的块扩散模型进行并行草稿生成。该模型通过一次前向传播生成草稿令牌，并利用从目标模型提取的上下文特征来指导草稿模型，从而实现高效且高质量的草稿生成和更高的接受率。

Result: 实验表明，DFlash在多种模型和任务上实现了超过6倍的无损加速，并且比最先进的推测解码方法EAGLE-3快了2.5倍。

Conclusion: DFlash是一种有效的推测解码框架，它通过并行草稿生成解决了LLMs的推理瓶颈，并在加速和效率方面取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

### [51] [Momentum Attention: The Physics of In-Context Learning and Spectral Forensics for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04902)
*Kingsuk Maitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过引入动量注意力机制，将Transformer类比为物理电路，并结合能量守恒定律和时变交流动力学。该机制通过运动学差分算子（$p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$）和辛剪切变换（$\\\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$）来嵌入物理先验。研究发现物理剪切与高通滤波器在数学上等价，实现了“辛-滤波器对偶性”。这一贡献打破了仅靠拓扑深度（L≥2）才能形成归纳头的限制，使单层归纳成为可能，并通过伯德图进行频谱分析。论文提出了一个正交性定理，证明了低通RoPE与高通动量结合时，直流（语义）和交流（机制）信号能在正交频带内分离。通过大量实验验证，动量模型在归纳任务上表现优于基线模型，并发现了动量-深度可替代性的标度律（$γ^* = 4.17 	imes N^{-0.74}$）。该框架整合了生成AI、哈密顿物理和信号处理，可作为分析工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将Transformer的计算图扩展为包含守恒定律和时变动力学的物理电路，并解决标准Transformer在归纳头形成时对拓扑深度的依赖问题。

Method: 引入动量注意力机制，它通过运动学差分算子（$p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$）和辛剪切变换（$\\\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$）将物理先验嵌入查询（queries）和键（keys）中，并将Transformer视为物理电路。发现了辛-滤波器对偶性，即物理剪切等同于高通滤波器。形式化了正交性定理，证明了直流（语义）和交流（机制）信号在低通RoPE与高通动量结合时能分离到正交频带。

Result: 单层归纳成为可能，并可通过伯德图进行频谱分析。实验（5100+次）表明，1.25亿参数的动量模型在归纳任务上表现超出预期，与3.5亿参数的基线模型相比，验证损失仅高出约2.9%。关联回忆实验揭示了标度律 $γ^* = 4.17 	imes N^{-0.74}$，证明了动量和深度的可替代性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过注入运动学动量，打破了Transformer归纳头形成对拓扑深度的限制，实现了单层归纳和频谱分析，并将生成AI、哈密顿物理和信号处理联系起来，为模型分析提供了一个新的工具。

Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.

### [52] [Mind the Performance Gap: Capability-Behavior Trade-offs in Feature Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04903)
*Eitan Sprejer,Oscar Agustín Stanchi,María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Iván Arcuschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 特征引导方法虽然能有效控制大型语言模型（LLM）的行为，但可能显著降低模型的准确性和连贯性，即使在成功引导目标行为的情况下。相比之下，简单的提示工程在控制行为和维持模型性能之间取得了更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估特征引导方法（如Auto Steer）在实际应用中控制大型语言模型行为的有效性，并考察其与输出质量（准确性和连贯性）之间是否存在权衡。

Method: 使用Llama-8B和Llama-70B模型，在171个大规模多任务语言理解（MMLU）问题上，将Goodfire的Auto Steer方法与提示工程基线进行了比较。评估了14种不同类型的引导查询（包括无害和安全相关行为），并测量了准确性、连贯性和行为控制能力。

Result: Auto Steer成功地改变了目标行为（在Llama-8B上得分从提示的2.98提高到3.33，在Llama-70B上从3.10提高到3.57）。然而，它导致了显著的性能下降：在Llama-8B上，MMLU问题的准确性从66%下降到46%，连贯性从4.62下降到2.24；在Llama-70B上，准确性从87%下降到73%，连贯性从4.94下降到3.89。简单的提示工程在准确性和行为控制之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 目前的特征引导方法在实际部署中存在局限性，因为它们可能会牺牲模型在任务上的表现。研究表明，机制性控制方法面临着基本的“能力-行为”权衡，在部署前需要进行实证表征。

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

*Yiwen Wang,Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCER通过双阶段压缩和基于能量的重建来解决多模态融合中的噪声输入和模态缺失问题，并在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合面临噪声输入导致表示质量下降和模态缺失导致预测失败的鲁棒性挑战。

Method: DCER框架通过两个阶段进行操作：1. 压缩阶段：在模态内进行频率变换（音频使用小波，视频使用DCT）以去除噪声并保留任务相关模式；跨模态引入瓶颈令牌以强制进行真正的模态融合，而非特定模态的捷径。 2. 重建阶段：对于缺失的模态，通过在学习到的能量函数上进行梯度下降来恢复表示，最终的能量值提供了内在的不确定性量化（与预测误差>0.72相关）。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并在完整和高缺失条件下均表现出U型鲁棒性模式，表明多模态融合在两种极端情况下的优势。

Conclusion: DCER框架有效地解决了多模态融合中的鲁棒性问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间序列建模中，尤其是在动态变化的情况下，实现高效且准确的推理时自适应是一个挑战。现有模型可能难以快速适应新的或变化的动态。

Method: LISA结合了延迟坐标嵌入和拉普拉斯谱学习，生成扩散坐标状态表示。它还引入了基于高斯过程回归或类似注意力机制的马尔可夫算子的轻量级潜在空间残差适配器，用于一步预测。

Result: LISA在预测和自回归展开实验中，相较于冻结基线模型有所改进，尤其在动态变化的情况下效果更佳。其性能与非参数谱方法相关。

Conclusion: LISA成功地实现了拉普拉斯时间序列模型在推理时的自适应，将上下文学习与非参数谱方法联系起来，并在实验中证明了其有效性，特别是在处理动态变化方面。

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果发现中整合物理模型（如ODE）作为归纳偏置，以提高动态因果发现的辨识度、稳定性和鲁棒性，但现有方法在处理现实世界中的反馈、循环和非平稳数据方面存在挑战。

Method: 将系统演化建模为随机微分方程（SDE），其中漂移项包含已知的ODE动力学，扩散项包含未知的因果耦合。开发了一种利用因果图结构的、可扩展的、诱导稀疏性的最大似然估计（MLE）算法来进行参数估计。

Result: 在具有不同因果结构的动态系统上进行的实验表明，该方法在因果图恢复方面优于纯数据驱动的基线方法，并产生更稳定、物理上一致的估计。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地整合物理知识，提高动态系统中因果发现的性能，并为处理复杂和现实世界的动态系统提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPC是一种通过耦合配对时间步长的速度预测来减少连续时间生成模型中估计器方差的原理，在不修改模型架构、概率路径或求解器的情况下，提高了样本质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续时间生成模型（如扩散模型、流匹配和整流流）在训练时通常采用独立处理时间步长的目标，这会导致估计器方差过高和采样效率低下。

Method: TPC通过在概率路径上的配对时间步长之间耦合速度预测来实现，这是一种完全在估计器层面操作的轻量级方差减少原理，无需修改模型架构、概率路径或求解器。理论分析表明，TPC引入了一种二次的、与轨迹耦合的正则化，可以有效降低梯度方差，同时保持了流匹配目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet图像集上，TPC在多个分辨率下均提高了样本质量和采样效率，实现了更低的FID分数，并且计算成本与现有方法相当或更低。此外，TPC可以无缝扩展到现代的SOTA（State-of-the-Art）风格管线，包括噪声增强训练、基于分数的去噪和整流流。

Conclusion: TPC是一种有效的方差减少技术，可以提高连续时间生成模型的性能，并且易于集成到现有模型和训练流程中。

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAPO是一种新的LLM对齐方法，通过使用动态的、几何感知的锚点来替代固定的参考策略，以解决现有方法中的分布不匹配和奖励漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在对齐大型语言模型时，使用静态参考策略可能会导致分布不匹配和错误信号的放大，而无参考策略则可能面临奖励漂移的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为几何锚点偏好优化（GAPO）的新方法，该方法用一个动态的、几何感知的锚点替代固定的参考策略。该锚点是当前策略在小半径内的对抗性局部扰动，作为一种悲观基线。GAPO还引入了一种自适应重加权机制，根据每个偏好对的局部敏感度来调节其重要性。此外，还提出了锚点差距（Anchor Gap），即策略与锚点之间的奖励差异，并证明它在平滑条件下可以近似最坏情况下的局部裕度下降。

Result: GAPO在各种噪声设置下，一致地提高了模型的鲁棒性，并在标准的LLM对齐和推理基准测试中达到了相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: GAPO通过引入动态锚点和锚点差距，有效地解决了LLM对齐中的挑战，提高了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A$^2$-LLM is an end-to-end model that unifies language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion for expressive conversational digital humans, overcoming limitations of cascaded systems. It uses the FLAME-QA dataset for training and achieves superior emotional expressiveness with real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational digital human systems use cascaded architectures that suffer from error accumulation, high latency, and poor real-time performance. They also lack access to conversational context, leading to rigid lip-sync over emotional depth.

Method: The paper proposes A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion in a unified framework. It utilizes a new multimodal dataset, FLAME-QA, for training to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics.

Result: A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization, achieving superior emotional expressiveness and real-time efficiency with 500 ms latency and 0.7 RTF.

Conclusion: The proposed A$^2$-LLM system effectively addresses the limitations of traditional cascaded systems by offering an end-to-end solution for creating emotionally expressive and responsive conversational digital humans with real-time performance.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAY是一种新的线性注意力机制，它基于E-Product（Yat-kernel）的松弛和高效计算公式，实现了与标准Softmax注意力几乎相当的性能，同时保持了线性的时间和内存复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种新的线性时间注意力机制，以克服标准Softmax注意力的二次复杂度瓶颈，同时尽可能接近其性能。

Method: 提出球形线性化注意力（SLAY），它将查询和键约束在单位球面上，并利用Yat-kernel的松弛公式。通过Bernstein定理，将球形Yat-kernel表示为多项式-指数积核的非负混合，并推导出严格正的随机特征近似，实现了O(L)的线性时间注意力。证明了其在球面上的正定性和有界性，并确保了注意力分数的明确性和非负性。

Result: SLAY在性能上几乎与标准Softmax注意力无法区分，同时保持了线性的时间和内存扩展性。它在实践中一致优于现有的线性时间注意力机制，如Performer和Cosformer。

Conclusion: SLAY是迄今为止报道的最接近Softmax注意力的线性时间近似，它使得可扩展的Transformer模型能够在没有典型性能权衡的情况下实现线性注意力。

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

Motivation: 现有张量分解和异常检测方法无法处理异构张量流（包含分类和连续属性），并且通过离散化时间戳来处理时间动态，这会影响异常检测的准确性，特别是对于群组异常。

Method: HeteroComp方法将异构张量流连续地概括为‘组件’，这些组件代表每个属性中的潜在群组及其时间动态。该方法利用高斯过程先验来模拟连续属性和时间动态的未知分布，直接从数据中估计概率密度。

Result: HeteroComp方法能够准确地检测群组异常，并且其计算时间不依赖于数据流的长度。在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，HeteroComp在群组异常检测准确性方面优于最先进的算法。

Conclusion: HeteroComp成功地解决了异构张量流的分析和群组异常检测的挑战，通过有效处理异构属性和时间动态，提供了准确且计算效率高的方法。

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

### [61] [Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918)
*Long Zhang,Fangwei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often comply with conflicting in-context information over pre-existing knowledge. This paper investigates the mechanism behind this 'sycophancy' using layer-wise geometric analysis on Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B. The study refutes the 'Manifold Dilution' hypothesis and reveals that compliance is driven by 'Orthogonal Interference,' where conflicting contexts introduce a steering vector nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, altering the hidden state representation. This implies LLMs bypass correct information through geometric displacement rather than magnitude suppression, challenging scalar confidence metrics and highlighting the need for vectorial monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the mechanistic realization of how LLMs resolve knowledge conflicts through compliance with in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, specifically whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream.

Method: Conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B. Decomposed the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components.

Result: Empirical results rejected the universality of the 'Manifold Dilution' hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite significant performance degradation on factual queries. Observed that compliance is consistently characterized by 'Orthogonal Interference,' where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation.

Conclusion: Compliance in LLMs is characterized by 'Orthogonal Interference,' a geometric displacement mechanism that bypasses correct unembedding vectors rather than suppressing the magnitude of internal truths. This challenges scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and emphasizes the necessity of vectorial monitoring to differentiate genuine knowledge integration from in-context mimicry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可以通过渐进式压缩进行高效压缩，以应对计算资源限制，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的巨大计算需求，需要一种在不损害性能的情况下减少参数冗余的方法。

Method: 采用一种名为“Prune-Tune Loop”（PTL）的渐进式压缩方法，该方法通过多轮迭代，在每一轮中执行剪枝和微调，以逐步减小模型尺寸并恢复性能。

Result: PTL能够将LLMs压缩近一半，且仅需轻量级微调即可在推理任务上保持与原模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: PTL是一种灵活且有效的LLM压缩技术，适用于多种剪枝策略和微调方法，并且在数学推理、代码生成等多种任务上均表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

Motivation: 现有神经算子在处理具有强敏感性的通用、高度可变的边界条件（BCs）方面能力有限，这限制了它们在科学机器学习中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种通过函数扩展将边界数据映射到整个空间域的潜在伪扩展的通用框架，使标准的算子学习架构能够处理边界信息。

Result: 在包括泊松方程、线弹性和超弹性问题在内的18个具有挑战性的数据集上，该方法在处理高度可变的、混合类型的、分量式的和多段的边界条件以及多样化的几何形状方面，取得了最先进的准确性，并且在整个数据集上无需进行超参数调整。

Conclusion: 学习边界到域的扩展是一种有效且实用的策略，可以在现有的神经算子框架中强制执行复杂的边界条件，从而为更广泛的偏微分方程控制问题实现准确且鲁棒的科学机器学习模型。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

TL;DR: 为了解决音频-视觉问答（AVQA）模型在不确定时倾向于错误回答而非弃权的问题，本文提出了可靠音频-视觉问答（R-AVQA）的正式问题框架。研究者们开发了一种名为自适应置信度精炼（ACR）的轻量级方法，通过引入一个预测模型用于修正最大Softmax概率（MSP）的不足，并引入一个门控机制来评估MSP的可靠性。实验证明，ACR在多种设置下均优于现有方法，为R-AVQA任务奠定了基础。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AVQA模型虽然准确率高，但其在不确定时识别错误并弃权的能力仍有待研究。本文旨在解决这个问题，提高AVQA模型在不确定情况下的可靠性。

Method: 提出自适应置信度精炼（ACR）方法，该方法在最大Softmax概率（MSP）的基础上，引入两个学习头：残差风险头（用于预测MSP未捕捉到的正确性残差）和置信度门控头（用于判断MSP的可靠性）。ACR通过输入自适应的残差修正来增强MSP作为置信度信号的效用。

Result: ACR在各种设置（包括分布内、分布外和数据偏差）下，在三种不同的AVQA架构上均持续优于现有方法，为R-AVQA任务建立了坚实的基础。

Conclusion: ACR是一种有效的方法，可以提高AVQA模型在不确定情况下的可靠性，通过改进置信度评估和引入自适应修正来减少错误回答，并促进模型在不可靠情况下的弃权。

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

Conclusion: STIR框架证明了通过动态潜在轨迹控制可以实现显式链式思考的好处，通过内化推理过程来绕过显式生成，同时获得更高的保真度。

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Conclusion: TurboBoA成功地在提高PTQ效率和精度的同时，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Motivation: To understand the computational dynamics of decoder-only LLMs in transforming context into predictions by analyzing their representational geometry and implementing mechanistic interventions.

Method: Combined geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention to study the representational geometry of LLMs. Analyzed the angular organization and representation norms in late-layer representations.

Result: Identified a depth-wise transition in LLMs from context-processing to prediction-forming phases. Found that late-layer representations have a structured geometric code where angular organization parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, and norms encode context-specific information.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic-geometric account of how LLMs transform context into predictions, highlighting the role of representational geometry in this process.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

TL;DR: HC-GCD is a novel hyperbolic GCD method that clusters directly in hyperbolic space, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior hyperbolic GCD methods transform back to Euclidean geometry for clustering, which is suboptimal. This paper hypothesizes that clustering directly in hyperbolic space will yield better results.

Method: The paper proposes Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model and clusters them using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm directly in hyperbolic space.

Result: HC-GCD performs on par with the state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets. Experiments show that hyperbolic K-Means yields better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. Ablation studies indicate that clipping the norm of Euclidean embeddings affects accuracy for seen and unseen classes differently, and that hyperbolic K-Means provides more consistent clusters across varying label granularities.

Conclusion: Clustering directly in hyperbolic space using HC-GCD is beneficial for Generalized Category Discovery. Hyperbolic K-Means is more effective than Euclidean K-Means for this task, leading to improved accuracy and cluster consistency.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

Conclusion: CSRv2使得超稀疏嵌入在不牺牲性能的情况下变得实用，拓宽了实时和边缘可部署AI系统的设计空间，其中嵌入质量和效率都至关重要。

Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

Conclusion: Transolver-3 presents a scalable and efficient solution for high-fidelity physics simulations on industrial-scale meshes, overcoming the limitations of current GPU memory capacity and enabling complex engineering task simulations.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

Conclusion: π-Distill和OPSD是有效的PI蒸馏方法，在特定情况下OPSD也具有竞争力。这些方法在多轮Agent环境中能够有效提取Agent行为，并且在性能上优于行业标准方法。

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA 变体与香草 LoRA 在经过广泛的超参数搜索后，在各种任务和模型规模上都达到了相似的峰值性能，表明学习率的调整是关键，并且原始 LoRA 仍然是一个有竞争力的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估 LoRA 变体的改进是否在不同超参数设置下仍然成立，特别是在学习率方面，以及与香草 LoRA 相比的优势。

Method: 通过广泛的超参数搜索，在数学和代码生成任务上，对四种 LoRA 变体和香草 LoRA 进行了系统的重新评估，并进行了二阶分析。

Result: 在经过充分调整学习率后，所有 LoRA 方法在不同任务和模型规模上都实现了相似的峰值性能（1-2% 的差异），仅观察到细微的秩依赖行为。不同的 LoRA 方法偏好不同的学习率范围，这可以通过最大海森特征值来解释。

Conclusion: 原始 LoRA 仍然是一个有竞争力的基线，并且在单一训练配置下报告的改进可能并不反映持续的方法论优势。最佳学习率范围的变化源于海森特征值最大的差异，这与经典的 학습 理论一致。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

TL;DR: 奖励引导在离散扩散语言模型中存在梯度不连续和优化不准确的问题。提出了一种名为 EntRGi 的新机制，通过动态调节奖励模型的梯度来解决这些问题，从而提高了奖励引导的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 为了将奖励引导成功应用于离散扩散语言模型，需要克服在离散输出上进行微分的挑战，现有方法存在梯度反馈差和优化不准确的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为 EntRGi（熵感知奖励引导）的新机制，该机制通过整合模型的置信度来动态调节连续松弛，从而调节奖励模型的梯度。

Result: 在 7B 参数的扩散语言模型上，使用 3 个不同的奖励模型和 3 个多技能基准进行评估，EntRGi 在所有情况下均取得了一致的改进，优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: EntRGi 通过动态调节连续松弛来解决离散扩散语言模型中奖励引导的挑战，在多个基准测试中提供了显著且可靠的改进。

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 通过将上下文学习（ICL）重新构建为专家乘积模型，我们提出了一种新颖的差分隐私（DP）ICL算法，该算法具有理论依据，可轻松并行化，并能在保持强隐私保证的同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私（DP）方法在计算成本、效率和有效性方面存在不足，无法有效保护在情境学习（ICL）中可能出现的隐私敏感信息。

Method: 将ICL问题重新表述为专家乘积模型，并开发了一个具有理论依据且可并行化的算法。

Result: 在文本分类、数学和视觉语言等五个数据集的评估中，与先前DP-ICL方法相比，该方法平均提高了30%以上的准确率，同时保持了强隐私保证。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于专家乘积模型的DP-ICL框架在提高准确性和保持隐私性方面优于现有方法，并具有理论优势和计算效率。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 该算法框架为对抗性上下文下的CCB问题提供了一种新颖且有效的解决方案，在理论分析和实际应用方面都具有优势。

Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.

We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Conclusion: 拉普拉斯表示法是一种有效的潜在空间，可以用于模型学习规划，它能够捕捉状态空间距离，将问题分解为子目标，并减轻累积误差，从而在RL任务中取得优于基线方法的性能。

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

Conclusion: ControlG框架通过控制理论成功协调了多目标图SSL，解决了传统方法中的目标冲突和训练不稳定问题，并取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

Method: ReFORM首先学习一个行为克隆（BC）流策略，其具有有界源分布以捕捉动作分布的支持。然后，优化一个反射流，该反射流为BC流生成有界噪声，同时保持其支持，以最大化性能。

Conclusion: ReFORM通过强制执行限制性较小的支持约束，有效解决了离线强化学习中的OOD误差和策略表达能力问题，并在广泛的任务中取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework using Quantile Regression Forests and physics-based constraints recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeways under various weather conditions, utilizing connected vehicle and road weather data. The model shows strong predictive accuracy and potential for real-world deployment to enhance safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increased crash risk due to reduced visibility and tire-road friction in inclement weather by recommending real-time safe driving speeds.

Method: A hybrid framework was developed, employing Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate speed distributions using 26 features from CV and RWIS data. A physics-based upper speed limit was calculated based on real-time grip and visibility. The final recommendation fused QRF quantiles, posted speed limits, and the physics-derived upper bound.

Result: The QRF model achieved a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, and a PICP (50%) of 48.55%. The model demonstrated robust generalization across different weather conditions and road segments.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid predictive framework effectively recommends real-time safe speed intervals, showing strong predictive performance and generalization capabilities, indicating its promise for real-world application in improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

### [87] [Does SGD Seek Flatness or Sharpness? An Exactly Solvable Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05065)
*Yizhou Xu,Pierfrancesco Beneventano,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD's preference for flatness or sharpness in neural networks depends on label noise isotropy, not an intrinsic flatness-seeking behavior. The model prefers minimal gradient fluctuations, with data distribution determining convergence sharpness. Isotropic label noise leads to flat minima, while anisotropic noise results in sharp minima, a finding reproduced across MLP, RNN, and transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD during neural network training, addressing conflicting evidence by analyzing an analytically solvable model.

Method: Developed and solved an analytically solvable model of SGD training to investigate its preference for flat or sharp solutions. Examined the role of gradient fluctuations and data distribution, specifically the isotropy/anisotropy of label noise. Validated findings using MLP, RNN, and transformer architectures.

Result: The model demonstrates that SGD does not have an inherent preference for flatness but rather seeks minimal gradient fluctuations. The sharpness at convergence is uniquely determined by the data distribution and the isotropy of label noise. Isotropic noise leads to flat minima, while anisotropic noise allows convergence to arbitrarily sharp solutions depending on the noise spectrum imbalance.

Conclusion: SGD's training dynamics are driven by a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations, not an inherent flatness-seeking property. The data distribution and, crucially, the isotropy of label noise dictate whether the converged solution will be flat or sharp. This insight holds across different neural network architectures.

Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.

Motivation: 解释复杂机器学习模型决策的可靠性，即在现实的、非对抗性的变化下解释是否保持稳定和一致，这一点至关重要，但目前尚未得到充分衡量。现有方法（如SHAP和IG）的解释可能因输入扰动、特征冗余、模型更新和分布变化等因素而产生巨大差异，这会破坏解释的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种名为解释可靠性指数（ERI）的度量标准家族，用于量化解释在四个可靠性公理下的稳定性：对输入微扰的鲁棒性、特征冗余下的不变性、模型演化下的光滑性以及对温和分布移位的韧性。为每个公理推导了形式化保证，包括Lipschitz型界和时间稳定性结果。提出了ERI-T，一种用于顺序模型的特定时间可靠性度量。引入了ERI-Bench基准，用于系统性地测试解释可靠性。

Result: 实验结果揭示了流行的解释方法普遍存在可靠性问题，表明在实际部署条件下，解释可能是不稳定的。ERI度量标准能够揭示和量化这些不稳定性。

Conclusion: ERI提供了一种原则性的方法来评估解释的可靠性，并支持更值得信赖的可解释AI（XAI）系统。通过量化解释的不稳定性，可以提高XAI系统的可信度。

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在有策略的分类场景下，研究了个体公平性问题，提出了一种基于随机化分类器的最优个体公平分类方法，并通过线性规划求解，实验证明了该方法在提升公平性的同时，也能兼顾准确率。


<details>

Conclusion: 基于随机化分类器的方法是解决策略分类中个体公平性问题的有效途径，并且可以扩展到群体公平性。该方法在保持较高准确率的同时，显著提升了分类的公平性。

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于组合问题的单查询无偏随机梯度方法，该方法可推广到REINFORCE算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在组合问题的概率重构中，通常需要对超立方体进行优化，这对应于原始问题中每个二元变量的伯努利概率参数。然而，组合问题的性质意味着精确梯度计算需要多次查询。

Method: 提出了一种随机梯度方法，该方法是无偏的，并且只需要对组合函数进行一次查询。

Result: 该方法包含了经过重要性采样的REINFORCE算法，并引入了一类新的随机梯度。

Conclusion: 所提出的单查询无偏随机梯度方法为组合问题的概率重构提供了一种更有效率的优化途径。

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为RRD的框架，用于改进大型语言模型（LLM）裁判的评分标准（rubrics），以提高其在主观、细致和多维度人类偏好评估中的准确性，并优化其作为强化微调（RFT）的奖励信号。RRD通过递归分解-过滤循环来优化评分标准，解决现有评分标准覆盖不足、维度混淆、偏好方向错误以及标准冗余或高度相关等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评分标准在指导LLM裁判进行主观偏好评估和作为强化微调的奖励信号时存在生成困难且难以控制的问题，这会导致裁判准确性下降和次优的奖励信号。

Method: RRD框架采用递归分解-过滤循环。首先，它将粗粒度的评分标准分解为更精细、更具区分度的标准，以扩大覆盖范围并区分不同响应。其次，通过过滤机制去除不匹配和冗余的标准。最后，采用与相关性感知的加权方案，防止高度相关的标准被过度代表，从而生成信息丰富、全面且无冗余的评分标准集。

Result: RRD在评估和训练方面均取得了显著且一致的改进。在评估方面，它提高了GPT-4o和Llama3.1-405B裁判在JudgeBench和PPE上的偏好判断准确性，在所有设置下均 đạt được 最佳性能，在JudgeBench上最高提升+17.7分。在训练方面，当用作RFT的奖励来源时，RRD相比之前的基线，显著提高了奖励信号的强度和稳定性，Qwen3-4B提升高达160%，Llama3.1-8B提升60%，而基线仅提升10-20%。这些改进在HealthBench-Hard和BiGGen Bench上得以迁移。

Conclusion: RRD框架通过递归评分标准优化，为开放域中的LLM裁判和奖励建模奠定了可扩展且可解释的基础，显著提高了LLM在主观偏好评估和生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

*Olga Ovcharenko,Matthias Boehm,Sebastian Schelter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can help build tabular ML pipelines by synthesizing semantic data operators. SemPipes uses natural language instructions for operators and automatically generates/optimizes code for data transformations, improving performance and reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing complex data preparation pipelines for tabular ML requires significant domain expertise and engineering effort. There's a need to leverage LLMs to assist in this process through code synthesis.

Method: SemPipes integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. These operators are defined in natural language and their execution is handled by a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations using data characteristics, instructions, and context. LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search is used for automatic optimization of data operations.

Result: SemPipes was evaluated on various tabular ML tasks and demonstrated substantial improvements in end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines. It also reduced pipeline complexity.

Conclusion: SemPipes effectively utilizes LLMs to synthesize and optimize semantic data operators, significantly enhancing the performance and simplifying the design of tabular ML pipelines.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

### [93] [Decoupled Orthogonal Dynamics: Regularization for Deep Network Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05136)
*Hao Chen,Jinghui Yuan,Hanmin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdamW的权重衰减并非最优，


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW虽然将权重衰减与自适应梯度缩放解耦，但仍存在“径向拉锯战”冲突：梯度倾向于增加参数范数以扩展有效容量并学习特征，而权重衰减则抑制范数增长，这种相互作用会产生径向振荡，并可能损害切向特征学习。

Method: 提出“正交动力学解耦”（Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling），并实现为AdamO优化器。AdamO采用类似SGD的更新处理一维范数控制，而Adam的自适应预处理仅限于切向子空间。此外，AdamO还引入了曲率自适应径向步长调整以及用于尺度不变层和低维参数的架构感知规则和投影。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，AdamO在不引入额外复杂约束的情况下，提高了泛化能力和稳定性。

Conclusion: AdamO通过将范数控制与自适应梯度缩放解耦，解决了AdamW中的“径向拉锯战”问题，从而在不增加复杂性的前提下提升了模型的泛化和稳定性。

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

Motivation: 解决经典多臂老虎机算法在存在隐藏的、随时间变化的状态时，奖励估计偏差和最优动作选择困难的问题。

Method: 引入了一系列无状态模型的多臂老虎机算法，利用滞后上下文特征和协调探测策略来隐式跟踪潜在状态并消除状态依赖的奖励模式。

Result: 所提出的算法及其自适应变体可以在没有显式状态模型的情况下学习最优策略，结合了计算效率和对非平稳奖励的鲁棒适应性。实证结果表明，在各种设置下，其性能优于经典方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的无状态模型的多臂老虎机算法，能够应对复杂的现实世界场景，并为实际应用中的算法选择提供了实用建议。

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 在机器学习模型部署后，当不同群体之间正例的发生率发生变化时，公平性可能会受到影响。本研究提出了处理这种群体条件先验概率偏移（GPPS）的方法，发现基于错误率的公平性度量（如平等机会）在GPPS下保持不变，而基于接受率的公平性度量（如人口统计均值）则会发生漂移。研究还表明，可以在没有目标标签的情况下识别目标域的风险和公平性指标，并提出了一种名为TAP-GPPS的无标签后处理算法，该算法能在最小化效用损失的同时，在目标域中实现人口统计均值公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究部署环境中因群体间正例发生率变化（群体条件先验概率偏移，GPPS）导致的公平性漂移问题，特别是对基于错误率（如平等机会）和接受率（如人口统计均值）的公平性度量进行分析。

Method: 1. 证明公平性度量在GPPS下的不变性或漂移性：证明基于错误率的公平性度量（如平等机会）在GPPS下保持不变，而基于接受率的公平性度量（如人口统计均值）会发生漂移，并证明这种漂移对于非平凡分类器是不可避免的（移位鲁棒不可能）。 2. 提出在无标签目标域中识别风险和公平性指标的方法：利用GPPS下ROC相关量的不变性，仅从源域标签和无标签目标域数据中估计目标域的风险和公平性度量。 3. 提出TAP-GPPS算法：一种无标签后处理算法，用于估计无标签数据中的先验概率，修正后验概率，并选择阈值以在目标域中满足人口统计均值公平性。

Result: 1. 理论上证明了平等机会在GPPS下是移位不变的，而人口统计均值则会漂移，且这种漂移对于非平凡分类器是不可避免的。 2. 证明了在GPPS下，可以使用源域标签和无标签目标域数据来识别目标域的风险和公平性度量。 3. 提出的TAP-GPPS算法在实验中被证明能够有效实现目标域的人口统计均值公平性，并且效用损失最小。

Conclusion: 公平性度量在不同群体条件先验概率偏移（GPPS）下表现出不同的行为：基于错误率的度量（如平等机会）是鲁棒的，而基于接受率的度量（如人口统计均值）则会漂移。存在一种无需目标标签即可识别目标域风险和公平性指标的方法，并且提出的TAP-GPPS算法能够在实现目标域人口统计均值公平性的同时，最大限度地减少效用损失。

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

Motivation: LLM推理面临工作负载变化和系统约束带来的挑战，需要加速。

Method: TIDE通过重用目标模型隐藏状态作为训练信号，实现零开销草稿自适应，并使用自适应运行时控制和异构集群进行优化。

Result: TIDE在真实工作负载上实现了高达1.15倍的吞吐量提升，并将草稿训练时间缩短了1.67倍。

Conclusion: TIDE能够有效地加速LLM推理，并在不重新加载模型的情况下实现草稿自适应。

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

Method: 提出一种基于多任务学习（MTL）的框架，特别是采用交叉干扰（crosstalk）结构，联合学习故障类别和相关的物理变量。在此基础上，扩展了先前提出的残差神经降维器模型（residual neural dimension reductor）到两个基准数据集（无人机故障数据集和电机复合故障数据集）。

Result: 在无人机故障数据集和电机复合故障数据集上，所提出的基于残差神经降维器的交叉干扰多任务学习模型，相比于单任务模型、多类别模型和共享主干多任务模型，在故障分类任务上均取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 交叉干扰多任务学习框架能够有效地利用物理耦合信号中的额外信息，通过联合学习故障类别和物理变量，提升故障分类的准确性，并且优于其他对比模型。

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

TL;DR: CoSA是一种参数高效微调（PEFT）新方法，它不依赖于低秩分解，而是利用压缩感知理论，通过固定随机投影矩阵和紧凑的可学习核心来表达权重更新，能够在不同模型和任务上实现与SOTA相当或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法（如LoRA、PiSSA）大多基于低秩分解假设，这可能限制模型的表达能力，尤其是在单一数值分布相对均匀的任务特定适应场景中。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoSA（Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation）的新型PEFT方法，该方法借鉴了压缩感知理论。CoSA不限制权重更新到低秩子空间，而是通过固定的随机投影矩阵和紧凑的可学习核心来表示权重更新。理论分析证明了权重更新可以被压缩编码到低维空间并通过随机投影映射回。

Conclusion: CoSA提供了一种新颖的、基于压缩感知的参数高效微调视角，能够有效地进行多尺度模型适应，并且在实验中展现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

*Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui,Eleni Triantafillou,David Krueger,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models require capability control, distinct from alignment, to restrict harmful behaviors using a layered defense-in-depth approach across the model lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The broad capabilities of foundation models lead to potential misuse and failures. This paper argues for capability control as a separate goal from alignment to impose hard restrictions on model behavior, even under adversarial conditions.

Method: The paper proposes organizing capability control mechanisms into three layers: data-based control (training distribution), learning-based control (weight/representation interventions), and system-based control (post-deployment guardrails). It advocates for a defense-in-depth strategy combining these layers due to individual layer failure modes.

Result: The paper outlines a layered approach to capability control and identifies key challenges such as the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

Conclusion: Capability control is crucial for foundation models and should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. A defense-in-depth strategy composing complementary controls across data, learning, and system layers is necessary to address the inherent risks and challenges.

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

TL;DR: RLVR是一种增强LLM推理能力的方法，但现有方法（如GRPO）存在稳定性问题，例如在计算受限时估计方差过高，以及在所有响应奖励都为零时梯度信号消失。为解决此问题，本文提出了一种名为EBPO的新框架，通过借鉴策略累积的全局统计数据来正则化基于局部组的基线。EBPO不单独估计基线，而是使用收缩估计器，通过Welford在线算法更新的全局先验动态地平衡局部组统计数据。理论上，EBPO保证比GRPO具有更低的均方误差（MSE），有界的熵衰减，以及在失败场景下不会消失的惩罚信号。实践中，EBPO在AIME和OlympiadBench等多个基准测试中表现优于GRPO和其他基线方法，在训练稳定性方面表现出色，即使在小组规模较小的情况下也能实现高性能，并且在难度分层课程学习中受益匪浅。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

*John Yan,Michael Yu,Yuqi Sun,Alexander Duffy,Tyler Marques,Matthew Lyle Olson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs and LLM-summarizers offer complementary insights into LLM behavior during reinforcement learning, revealing both fine-grained and strategic patterns, but human interpretability remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding behavior changes in large language models (LLMs) during complex reinforcement learning in multi-agent environments is difficult. Existing interpretability methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) show promise for data-centric interpretability.

Method: Applied pretrained SAEs and LLM-summarizer methods to analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs in the Full-Press Diplomacy environment. Introduced Meta-Autointerp to group SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. Evaluated discovered SAE Meta-Features using automated evaluation and two user studies. Augmented an untrained agent's system prompt with SAE-derived hypotheses.

Result: Discovered fine-grained behaviors (role-playing, degenerate outputs, language switching) and high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Automated evaluation validated 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features as significant. Found surprising reward hacking behavior. User studies indicated that many SAE features and LLM hypotheses were not helpful to humans, though a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses were predictively useful for downstream tasks. Augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt improved its score by +14.2%.

Conclusion: SAEs and LLM-summarizers provide complementary views into agent behavior during LLM training. The proposed framework is a practical starting point for data-centric interpretability to ensure trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training, despite challenges in human interpretability of some features.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

*Chun-Wun Cheng,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpectraKAN通过将输入信息条件化于频谱算子，使其能够自适应地处理多尺度、依赖于状态和各向异性的动力学，从而在多种PDE基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频谱算子（如FNO）依赖于静态傅里叶核，无法捕捉由系统全局状态控制的多尺度、依赖于状态和各向异性的动力学。

Method: SpectraKAN通过从时空历史中提取紧凑的全局表示，并利用单查询交叉注意力来调制多尺度傅里叶主干，将静态频谱卷积转化为输入条件积分算子。KAN理论上保证了其平滑性和利普希茨控制的全局调制，并能在网格细化下收敛到与分辨率无关的连续算子。

Result: SpectraKAN在多种PDE基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，在一些具有挑战性的时空预测任务上，RMSE降低了高达49%。

Conclusion: SpectraKAN通过引入输入条件化机制，克服了传统频谱算子的局限性，能够高效且准确地学习复杂的PDE解算子，尤其在处理多尺度和各向异性动力学方面表现出色。

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

*Wentao Ni,Kangqi Zhang,Zhongming Yu,Oren Nelson,Mingu Lee,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli,Jongryool Kim,Zhijian Liu,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过引入双重P，一种分层稀疏注意力框架，可以提高长上下文推理的效率。它通过聚类级别的粗粒度top-p估计和令牌级别的自适应精炼来优化准确性、选择开销和稀疏注意力成本，从而在保持准确性的同时减少计算开销并加速解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定预算的top-k稀疏注意力无法适应注意力分布的异质性，而top-p稀疏注意力虽然能保证更好的精度，但现有方法未能联合优化top-p精度、选择开销和稀疏注意力成本，限制了其效率。

Method: 提出了一种名为Double-P的分层稀疏注意力框架。它首先在聚类级别使用大小加权的质心进行粗粒度的top-p估计，然后通过第二个top-p阶段自适应地优化计算，仅在需要时分配令牌级别的注意力。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中，Double-P实现了接近零的准确率下降，将注意力计算开销降低了高达1.8倍，并实现了比最先进的固定预算稀疏注意力方法高出1.3倍的端到端解码速度。

Conclusion: Double-P通过分层优化框架，在保持高精度的同时，显著降低了注意力计算开销，并提高了长上下文推理的解码速度。

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

### [105] [Extreme Weather Nowcasting via Local Precipitation Pattern Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05204)
*Changhoon Song,Teng Yuan Chang,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new model called exPreCast is proposed for efficient and accurate precipitation nowcasting, especially for extreme events. It uses a novel balanced dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events is crucial for risk management, but current methods like diffusion models are too slow and deterministic models struggle with extreme events. Existing datasets are also biased.

Method: Propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework with local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor. Introduce a balanced radar dataset from KMA including both ordinary and extreme precipitation events.

Result: exPreCast achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (SEVIR, MeteoNet) and the new KMA dataset, providing accurate and reliable nowcasts for both normal and extreme rainfall.

Conclusion: The proposed exPreCast framework and the balanced KMA dataset effectively address the challenges in precipitation nowcasting, offering an efficient and accurate solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦表示学习旨在捕捉数据潜在的解释性因素，但现有基于扩散的方法在语义对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 提出一种基于流匹配的框架，将解耦视为在紧凑的潜在空间中学习因子条件流，并引入非重叠（正交性）正则化器来抑制因子间的交叉干扰和信息泄漏。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在解耦分数、可控性和样本保真度方面优于代表性基线。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过显式语义对齐和抑制信息泄漏，在解耦表示学习方面取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

### [107] [Private Prediction via Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05219)
*Chao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies differentially private prediction in streaming settings, aiming to reduce the dependence on the number of queries (T) from the standard sqrt(T) to polylogarithmic. It achieves this by developing private predictors with improved sample complexity for both oblivious and adaptive adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the dependence on the number of queries T in differentially private prediction from the standard $\sqrt{T}$ to a polylogarithmic factor, which is more efficient for streaming settings.

Method: The paper presents two main results: 1. For oblivious online adversaries and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, a private predictor is developed that uses $\tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples to answer T queries. 2. For adaptive online adversaries and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, a private predictor is developed that uses $|S|=\tilde{O}(d^{5.5}\log T)$ labeled examples.

Result: The proposed methods achieve a polylogarithmic dependence on T for the number of required labeled examples, a significant improvement over the standard $\sqrt{T}$ dependence.

Conclusion: The paper successfully reduces the sample complexity in differentially private prediction for streaming settings, offering more efficient solutions for both oblivious and adaptive adversaries by achieving polylogarithmic dependence on the number of queries.

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

*Jiecheng Lu,Xu Han,Yan Sun,Viresh Pati,Yubin Kim,Siddhartha Somani,Shihao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 线性注意力机制在保持 O(N) 复杂度的同时，通过引入零和 softmax 残差来克服加性信息融合和均匀权重偏差的限制，实现了与标准 softmax 注意力相当或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性注意力方法虽然具有O(N)复杂度，但在性能上通常逊于标准的softmax注意力。其根本原因在于两个限制：一是仅允许加性信息融合的凸组合限制；二是稀释长上下文注意力的均匀累积权重偏差。

Method: 提出了一种名为ZeroSum Linear Attention（ZeroS）的方法，通过移除常数项1/t并对剩余的零和softmax残差进行重加权来解决上述问题。

Result: ZeroS 在理论上能够表示比凸组合更广泛的函数集，同时保持O(N)复杂度。实验结果表明，ZeroS在各种序列建模基准测试中的表现与标准softmax注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: ZeroS通过数学上稳定的权重（允许正负值）实现了对比操作，并能在保持线性复杂度的同时，提升模型在序列建模任务上的表现。

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的数据中心框架通过整合动态图建模和平衡异常合成，有效解决了图异常检测中的关键挑战，提高了模型的检测能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is crucial in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity. Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: CDAS是一种新的模型干预方法，通过匹配干预输出和反事实分布来引导模型，解决了现有方法过度拟合和输出不自然的问题，并在模型操控和安全性方面展现出良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于干预的模型操控方法采用优化目标，容易导致过拟合和输出不自然。本文认为模型操控的关键在于识别内部机制而非强制外部偏好。

Method: 提出概念分布式对齐搜索（CDAS）方法，沿用DAS的分布式交换干预（DII）机制，引入新的分布匹配目标，通过弱监督匹配干预输出分布与反事实分布来学习干预。CDAS通过弱监督分布匹配而非概率最大化来学习干预，并使用能进行双向操控并从数据中导出操控因素的DII。

Result: 在AxBench基准测试中，CDAS不总是优于偏好优化方法，但在模型规模增大时受益更多。在两个与安全相关的案例研究中，CDAS系统地实现了操控，同时保持了模型的通用效用，包括覆盖安全对齐模型的拒绝行为和中和链式思考后门。

Conclusion: CDAS是一种干预式模型操控的稳健方法，可以与偏好优化方法互补，并在特定条件下表现更好。

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORP是一种无需微调的闭式结构化剪枝框架，用于ViT，通过将剪枝视为表示恢复问题，并在无标签数据上进行，实现了高效且准确的剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT结构化剪枝方法通常需要重新训练或多阶段优化，限制了其在训练后部署的灵活性。本研究旨在提出一种能够在训练后、无需微调的约束下进行ViT结构化剪枝的方法。

Method: CORP将结构化剪枝视为表示恢复问题，将移除的MLP隐藏层维度和注意力子结构建模为保留部分的仿射函数，并利用无标签校准集推导出岭回归的闭式解，将补偿折叠到模型权重中，从而最小化校准分布下的预期表示误差。

Result: 实验表明，ViT的MLP和注意力表示存在显著冗余。未经补偿的单次结构化剪枝会导致严重的准确率下降。而CORP能够在高稀疏度下保持模型准确率，例如在DeiT-Huge模型上，剪枝50%的MLP和注意力结构后，仍能保持82.8%的Top-1准确率。CORP的剪枝过程可以在单GPU上20分钟内完成，并带来显著的实际效率提升。

Conclusion: CORP是一种有效的、无需微调的闭式结构化剪枝框架，能够在高稀疏度下显著提升ViT的推理效率，同时保持其准确性，适用于训练后的部署场景。

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

TL;DR: 通过引入混合门控流（HGF），一种结合了1.58位三元主干和可学习的低秩FP16校正路径的双流架构，可以有效缓解LLM在边缘设备上部署时因内存瓶颈导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在边缘设备的部署受限于内存带宽瓶颈（“内存墙”），而现有的1.58位量化技术虽然减小了内存占用，但会导致显著的困惑度下降。

Method: 提出了一种混合门控流（HGF）的双流架构，该架构将1.58位三元主干与由自适应门控的低秩FP16校正路径相结合。

Result: 在TinyStories数据集上，HGF在2500和3500步训练下，验证损失分别为0.9306和1.0294，相比之下BitNet为1.0294。HGF恢复了三元量化与FP16基线之间约55%的质量差距，同时仅增加了约12-15%的内存开销。此外，HGF在训练过程中表现出良好的稳定性，而纯FP16的差分注意力基线则出现训练不稳定的情况。在更大规模的模型（1.2B和3B参数）上的实验也证实了HGF的稳定性和质量恢复能力可以线性扩展。

Conclusion: HGF架构能够有效解决LLM在边缘部署中的内存瓶颈问题，并在保持较低内存开销的同时，显著恢复因量化而损失的模型质量。量化还可以作为一种结构化正则化手段，提高模型的训练稳定性。HGF的优势在更大规模的模型和数据集上同样得到验证，表明其在实际生产环境中的潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的统一分析方法简洁、模块化，为理解和改进随机方差缩减算法提供了新的视角，并在理论和实践上均取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential Flow Matching, a Bayesian filtering-based framework, enables efficient real-time inference for sequential prediction from streaming data by learning probability flows between time steps, accelerating sampling compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion and flow-matching models for sequential prediction from streaming observations suffer from high inference latency due to repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, hindering real-time deployment. This work addresses the need for efficient, real-time inference in such systems.

Method: This paper introduces Sequential Flow Matching, a framework based on Bayesian filtering. It models sequential inference as learning a probability flow that transitions the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, aligning with recursive Bayesian belief updates. The method initializes generation from the previous posterior, providing a principled warm start to accelerate sampling.

Result: The proposed Sequential Flow Matching method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion models on various forecasting, decision-making, and state estimation tasks. Crucially, it requires only one or very few sampling steps, leading to significantly faster sampling times.

Conclusion: Framing sequential inference through the lens of Bayesian filtering offers a novel and principled approach for the efficient real-time application of flow-based models. The Sequential Flow Matching framework demonstrates that initializing generation from the previous posterior is a viable strategy for accelerating sampling in streaming inference scenarios.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

TL;DR: OSRL中的生成模型方法在拼接最优转移和平衡奖励-成本目标方面存在挑战。GAS算法通过增强和重新标记数据集、引入新的目标函数（使用期望回归训练）以及重塑数据集来解决这些问题，从而提高了拼接能力和奖励-成本权衡能力，并在约束环境下实现了稳健的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型（GM）辅助方法在离线安全强化学习（OSRL）中面临两大挑战：无法有效利用数据集中次优轨迹中的最优转移片段，以及难以平衡相互冲突的奖励和成本目标。

Method: 提出了一种名为目标辅助拼接（GAS）的新算法。GAS首先在转移层面增强和重新标记数据集，以从次优轨迹中构建高质量轨迹。然后，GAS引入新的目标函数，利用期望回归估计最优可实现的奖励和成本目标，以更好地平衡奖励最大化和约束满足。最后，GAS重塑数据集以实现更均匀的奖励-成本回报分布，以提高训练稳定性和效率。

Result: 该算法（GAS）在奖励最大化和约束满足的平衡方面表现出优于现有方法的性能，并在约束环境下实现了稳健的性能。

Conclusion: GAS算法通过增强数据、引入新的目标函数和优化数据集分布，有效解决了OSRL中生成模型方法的挑战，提高了在约束环境下的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的信息论框架为池式AL提供了新的理论视角，并揭示了数据选择和学习之间的内在联系。

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) suffer from oversmoothing. Unitary graph convolutions were proposed to preserve smoothness but may be overconstraining for physical systems with natural smoothing, like diffusion processes.

Method: Studied the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling. Proposed relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with natural smoothing. Generalized unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes.

Result: Unitary convolutions hurt performance for dynamics modeling tasks. Relaxed unitary convolutions outperform several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks, on experiments involving PDEs (heat and wave equations) over complex meshes and weather forecasting.

Conclusion: Relaxed unitary convolutions are a promising approach for modeling physical systems with GNNs, outperforming existing methods by balancing smoothness preservation with natural smoothing requirements.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于beta过程的贝叶斯框架能够自适应地确定GNN的消息聚合邻域范围，并与GNN参数同时优化，提高了GNN的表达能力，并在节点分类任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

Conclusion: HRT提供了一种解决高维决策树学习难题的有效方法，具有理论保证和良好的实践性能。

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

Conclusion: 通过生成技术对完整分布进行建模，为控制大型推理模型（LRMs）提供了一个更有效、更合乎原理的基础。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习“遗忘”方法仅在输出层（logits）实现“遗忘”，但未能清除模型中间层的表征信息，即“表面遗忘”现象。现有方法主要改变分类器，中间表征与原模型高度相似。

Method: 提出Erase at the Core（EC）框架，在模型层级上实现“遗忘”。EC结合了遗忘集的多层对比遗忘和保留集（retain set）的深度监督学习。具体做法是：在中间层添加辅助模块，并在每个监督点应用对比遗忘和交叉熵损失，同时进行层级加权损失。

Result: EC不仅实现了有效的logits层“遗忘”，还显著降低了中间层表征与原模型表征的相似度。EC是模型无关的，可以作为插件集成到现有遗忘方法中，以提升表征层面的“遗忘”能力，同时保持在保留集上的性能。

Conclusion: EC框架有效解决了现有机器学习“遗忘”方法仅实现“表面遗忘”的问题，通过多层级“遗忘”机制，实现了更深层次的信息清除，同时保证了模型在未遗忘数据集上的性能。该框架具有模型无关性和插件化能力，能够增强现有遗忘方法的性能。

Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO及其变体在基于可验证奖励的强化学习中表现良好，但存在梯度误分配（正例）和梯度主导（负例）的问题，导致策略更新效率低下且次优。

Method: 提出Rewards as Labels (REAL)框架，将可验证奖励视为分类标签而非标量权重，将策略优化重新表述为分类问题。在此基础上，引入锚点logits来增强策略学习。REAL通过诱导单调且有界的梯度加权来实现平衡的梯度分配。

Result: REAL在数学推理基准上的实验表明，它提高了训练稳定性，并且在1.5B模型上比DAPO提高了6.7%的平均Pass@1。在7B模型上，REAL比DAPO和GSPO分别提高了6.2%和1.7%。即使使用简单的二元交叉熵，REAL也比DAPO提高了4.5%。

Conclusion: REAL框架通过将奖励重新表述为标签，并结合锚点logits，有效解决了现有方法的梯度问题，提高了训练稳定性和在复杂推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了时间序列基础模型在电力需求预测中利用外源特征的能力，并与LSTM基线进行了比较，发现在不同市场、粒度和特征配置下，基础模型的表现差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估时间序列基础模型在利用外源特征（对电力需求预测至关重要）方面的有效性。

Method: 在新加坡和澳大利亚的电力市场，以每小时和每天的粒度，对MOIRAI、MOMENT、TinyTimeMixers、ChronosX和Chronos-2这几种基础模型进行评估，并与使用可逆实例归一化的LSTM基线进行比较。评估了三种特征配置：所有特征、选定特征和仅目标特征。

Result: Chronos-2在零样本设置下表现最佳，但简单的LSTM基线在新加坡气候稳定的情况下，尤其是在短期预测中，经常优于所有基础模型。模型架构很重要，TTM的通道混合和Chronos-2的分组注意力等协同架构实现能够有效利用外源特征，而其他方法则效果不一。地理背景也很重要，基础模型主要在气候多变的地区显示出优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果对基础模型普遍优于其他模型的假设提出了质疑，并强调了开发特定领域模型（尤其是在能源领域）的必要性。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合同态加密和元分类器的方法，以解决联邦学习中的隐私和拜占庭攻击问题，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时，仍然面临敏感数据泄露和拜占庭行为影响模型训练的风险。现有解决方案通常独立处理安全聚合和拜占庭弹性问题，难以同时实现两者。

Method: 1. 借鉴属性推断攻击的思路，训练了一系列过滤元分类器来识别和过滤拜占庭更新（包括后门、梯度反演、标签翻转和洗牌攻击）。 2. 提出了一种自动化方法，用于选择同态加密（CKKS）的最佳内核和降维超参数，以满足聚合约束和效率要求。

Result: 在FEMNIST、CIFAR10、GTSRB和acsincome基准测试中，SVM过滤在识别拜占庭更新方面达到了90%到94%的准确率，模型效用和加密推理运行时间仅有边际损失。整体聚合的加密推理运行时间在6到26秒之间。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地抵御拜占庭参与者，同时在模型效用和运行时间方面具有良好的表现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

*Sheshansh Agrawal,Thien Hang Nguyen,Douwe Kiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM reranking is powerful but inefficient. We propose a tournament graph framework aggregating k-wise comparisons to build a global preference graph. This framework achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods, improving accuracy and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reranking methods are either inefficient or fail to fully exploit information from ranking decisions. There is a need for more efficient and effective LLM reranking techniques.

Method: We introduce a tournament graph framework for k-wise reranking. Each k-document comparison generates a tournament of pairwise preferences, which are aggregated into a global preference graph. The transitive closure of this graph reveals additional orderings. We formalize certifiable rank determination and design a greedy query schedule to maximize information gain for identifying top-m items. The framework handles non-transitive preferences by collapsing cycles into equivalence classes for tiered rankings.

Result: Across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method demonstrates Pareto dominance over existing approaches. It matches or exceeds accuracy while using 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable methods and 7x fewer than pairwise methods, with near-identical quality.

Conclusion: The proposed tournament graph framework offers a principled and efficient approach to LLM reranking, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and token efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度强化学习（RL）中的超参数敏感性并非固有属性，而是可能被训练机制放大，尤其是在具有固定数据分布的离线目标条件RL中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究深度强化学习（RL）的超参数敏感性是固有问题还是由训练机制引起，特别是在离线目标条件RL中。

Method: 通过在离线目标条件RL中引入数据质量的调度变化来控制非平稳性，并研究了两种代表性算法（HIQL和QRL）在固定和非固定数据质量下的表现，同时引入了目标梯度对齐诊断来解释算法分歧。

Result: 与在线RL相比，HIQL和QRL在面对超参数配置变化时表现出更高的鲁棒性。当存在少量专家数据（约20%）时，QRL能维持广泛稳定的接近最优的性能区域，而HIQL则表现出尖锐的、在训练阶段漂移显著的最优区域。目标梯度对齐诊断显示，引导式目标（bootstrapped objectives）会加剧破坏性梯度干扰，这与超参数敏感性直接相关。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习（RL）的超参数敏感性并非不可避免，引导式目标（bootstrapping）的训练动态会放大这种敏感性，为设计更鲁棒的算法目标提供了方向。

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

TL;DR: DLM-Scope 是第一个用于扩散语言模型 (DLM) 的基于稀疏自编码器 (SAE) 的可解释性框架。它能提取可解释的特征，并发现 SAE 插入 DLM 的影响与自回归 LLM 不同，有时甚至能降低损失。DLM-Scope 在 DLM 的干预和解码方面也表现出优势，并为 DLM 的 SAE 研究奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散语言模型 (DLM) 成为自回归大型语言模型 (LLM) 的有前景的替代品，因此有必要为 DLM 开发定制的机械可解释性工具。

Method: 提出 DLM-Scope，一个基于 SAE 的 DLM 可解释性框架，并使用训练好的 Top-K SAE 来提取特征。研究了 SAE 插入对 DLM 的影响，并将其与 LLM 进行了比较。探索了 SAE 在 DLM 解码和干预中的应用，以及 SAE 特征在 DLM 训练后阶段的稳定性。

Result: 训练好的 Top-K SAE 可以忠实地提取 DLM 的可解释特征。与 LLM 不同，SAE 插入 DLM 可以在早期层中降低交叉熵损失。DLM 的 SAE 特征可以实现比 LLM 更有效的扩散时间干预。SAE 可以为 DLM 的解码顺序提供有用的信号，并且 SAE 特征在 DLM 的训练后阶段是稳定的。

Conclusion: DLM-Scope 为 DLM 的机械可解释性奠定了基础，并展示了将 SAE 应用于 DLM 相关任务和算法的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

Conclusion: 提出统一的效率框架，结合两个新指标和明确的会计标准，以减少模糊性并支持一致的bits-per-Joule比较，并勾勒了与能量调整缩放分析的联系。

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

TL;DR: Constrained GRPO (C-GRPO) is a new framework that extends GRPO for policy learning with explicit behavioral constraints. It uses a Lagrangian-based approach with indicator cost functions to optimize violation rates. The paper identifies a pathology in advantage estimation that can break constrained learning and proposes a scalarized advantage construction to fix it. Experiments show C-GRPO stabilizes constraint control and improves performance in robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO framework is not explored for explicit behavioral constraints. This paper aims to extend GRPO to handle constrained policy optimization.

Method: Introduces Constrained GRPO (C-GRPO), a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO. Uses indicator cost functions for constraints and Lagrangian relaxation for optimization. Proposes a scalarized advantage construction to address issues in advantage estimation that corrupt the Lagrangian signal.

Result: Identified and formally derived an optimization pathology caused by naive multi-component advantage estimation in constrained learning. Demonstrated that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control in a toy gridworld. Showed improved constraint satisfaction and task success in robotics tasks.

Conclusion: Constrained GRPO (C-GRPO) is a simple and effective method for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI. The scalarized advantage construction is crucial for stable constraint enforcement and improved performance.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

Conclusion: KL3估计器驱动的约束在数学推理任务上能提高GRPO的训练稳定性和最终性能，这表明在策略优化中使用基于原则的策略发散约束的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Motivation: 现有认知不确定性量化方法在识别大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的误行为（如幻觉、危险指令）方面效果有限，因为它们通常只能捕捉整体认知不确定性，而无法区分内部知识冲突或信息缺失。

Method: 提出一种名为 Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ) 的细粒度方法。该方法将模型输出头部的特征解释为支持（正）或反对（负）证据，并利用证据理论对证据进行建模和聚合，以在单次前向传播中量化内部冲突（信息冲突）和知识差距（信息缺失）。

Conclusion: EUQ 是一种有效的细粒度方法，能够通过量化内部冲突和知识差距来检测 LVLM 的误行为，其表现优于现有方法，并能揭示不同类型误行为与不确定性来源之间的关系。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

TL;DR: DFPO是一种分布强化学习框架，通过将值建模为跨时间步的连续流来提高鲁棒性，并在嘈杂监督下进行训练，在对话、数学推理和科学任务中表现优于PPO和FlowRL等基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习（RL）训练面临监督噪声和领域外（OOD）泛化能力差的问题，特别是在LLM的后训练阶段。现有的分布RL方法通过独立学习每个分位数点来建模值，导致值表示粗糙，缺乏对状态信息的细粒度条件化，难以应对复杂和OOD条件。

Method: DFPO通过学习值流场而非孤立的分位数预测，将值建模为跨时间步的连续流。通过这种方式，DFPO能够捕获更丰富的状态信息，以进行更准确的优势估计。为了在嘈杂反馈下稳定训练，DFPO还整合了条件风险控制和沿值流轨迹的一致性约束。

Result: 在对话、数学推理和科学任务上的实验表明，DFPO在嘈杂监督下优于PPO、FlowRL和其他鲁棒基线，实现了更好的训练稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DFPO通过值流建模、条件风险控制和一致性约束，成功地解决了现实世界RL训练中的挑战，提高了训练稳定性和领域外泛化能力。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

Motivation: GRPO在LLM推理中存在探索效率低和难度适应性差的问题，这源于GRAE算法中的对称性。

Method: 提出不对称GRAE（A-GRAE），通过不对称地抑制正确轨迹的优势来鼓励探索，并通过课程学习策略优先处理简单样本，然后逐渐转向复杂样本，以最大化学习效率。

Result: A-GRAE在七个基准测试中，在LLM和MLLM上均持续改进了GRPO及其变体的性能。

Conclusion: GRAE中的对称性是导致GRPO在探索和难度适应方面存在瓶颈的原因。通过引入不对称性，A-GRAE能够有效解决这些问题，并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当复杂的逻辑公式的精确评分-基于引导可以从与原子属性相关的引导信号中获得时。

Method: 推导出精确的布尔演算，为精确逻辑引导提供充分条件。如果公式允许一种电路表示，其中合取组合条件上独立的子公式，析取组合上条件上独立或互斥的子公式，则可以实现精确的逻辑引导。在此情况下，可以使用高效的递归算法从原子分数和后验概率精确计算引导信号。此外，研究表明，对于常见分布类，任何期望的布尔公式都可以编译成这种电路表示。通过将原子引导分数与后验概率估计相结合，提出了一种混合引导方法，它结合了分类器引导和无分类器引导，可应用于组合逻辑引导和标准条件生成。

Conclusion: LOGDIFF框架能够通过原子分数和后验概率估计，对复杂的逻辑表达式进行约束生成。

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative. Although existing benchmarks have facilitated initial progress, they exhibit critical limitations in domain coverage, encoder flexibility, model diversity, and task scope, presenting significant challenges to fair evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenMAG, a comprehensive benchmark that integrates 19 datasets across 6 domains and incorporates 16 encoders to support both static and trainable feature encoding. OpenMAG further implements a standardized library of 24 state-of-the-art models and supports 8 downstream tasks, enabling fair comparisons within a unified framework. Through systematic assessment of necessity, data quality, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, we derive 14 fundamental insights into MAG learning to guide future advancements.

*Yikuan Zhang,Ning Yang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD 噪声协方差 C 与损失曲率（Hessian H）的关系通常被错误地认为成正比，但实际关系更复杂，C 与每样本 Hessian 的平方期望值成正比，两者近似对易，且对角线元素遵循幂律关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究随机梯度下降（SGD）引入的各向异性噪声与损失曲率之间的精确关系，纠正先前工作中关于噪声协方差与Hessian成正比的简化假设。

Method: 利用活动-权重对偶性（Activity--Weight Duality）推导噪声协方差 C 和每样本 Hessian（h_p）平方的期望值之间的普适性关系，并通过实验验证理论边界。

Result: 证明了SGD噪声协方差 C 与每样本 Hessian 的平方期望值成正比（C ∝ E_p[h_p^2]），而非直接与Hessian（H = E_p[h_p]）成正比。C 和 H 近似对易，其对角线元素 C_ii 和 H_ii 遵循幂律关系 C_ii ∝ H_ii^γ，其中指数 γ 的理论边界为 1 ≤ γ ≤ 2。

Conclusion: SGD噪声与损失曲率（Hessian）之间的关系比先前认为的更复杂，两者近似对易，对角线元素遵循幂律关系，该关系在深度学习中具有普适性，并由每样本Hessian的谱决定。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention, and existing pruning methods do not meet the requirements of differentiability, efficiency, and strict static budgets for hardware overhead.

Method: Shiva-DiT employs Residual-Based Differentiable Top-k Selection with a residual-aware straight-through estimator to ensure deterministic token counts for static compilation and end-to-end learnability. It also introduces a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy for an adaptive pruning schedule.

Result: Shiva-DiT achieves a 1.54x wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines on mainstream models like SD3.5, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads and establishing a new Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT effectively addresses the computational costs of Diffusion Transformers by using a novel pruning approach that balances differentiability, efficiency, and static budget constraints, leading to significant performance improvements and maintaining high fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

### [143] [Path-Guided Flow Matching for Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05616)
*Xuhui Li,Zhengquan Luo,Xiwei Liu,Yongqiang Yu,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into smaller synthetic ones for model training. Existing diffusion-based methods are slow and unstable. This paper introduces Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM), a novel flow matching framework for generative distillation that allows fast, deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE. PGFM uses latent space flow matching and a continuous path-to-prototype guidance for stable and efficient trajectory control. Experiments show PGFM matches or exceeds diffusion-based methods in performance with faster sampling and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based dataset distillation methods suffer from time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability due to heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, hindering downstream generalization, especially under strong control or low IPC. Therefore, there is a need for more efficient and stable distillation methods.

Method: PGFM is a flow matching-based framework for generative distillation. It learns class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution in the latent space of a frozen VAE. It utilizes a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, ensuring reliable trajectory landing on assigned prototypes while maintaining diversity and efficiency. The method enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps.

Result: PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches in performance with fewer sampling steps. It demonstrates remarkably improved efficiency, achieving 7.6x greater efficiency than diffusion-based counterparts while maintaining 78% mode coverage.

Conclusion: PGFM is the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, offering a fast, stable, and efficient alternative to existing diffusion-based methods. Its unique path-to-prototype guidance mechanism allows for reliable trajectory control and improved downstream generalization without compromising efficiency or diversity.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

*Mohamad Mohamad,Francesco Ponzio,Xavier Descombes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mode-dependent architectural components like Batch Normalization can destabilize on-policy optimization in PPO. MDR, a dual-phase training method, stabilizes PPO without changing the architecture, improving performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mode-dependent architectural components can destabilize on-policy optimization in visual reinforcement learning, specifically causing policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse in PPO due to discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior, particularly from Batch Normalization.

Method: MDR (Mode-Dependent Rectification) is proposed as a lightweight, dual-phase training procedure designed to stabilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) when using mode-dependent layers, without requiring any modifications to the existing architecture.

Result: Experiments conducted on procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks show that MDR effectively enhances the stability and performance of PPO. The method is also shown to be applicable to other mode-dependent layers.

Conclusion: MDR provides a stable and effective solution for training PPO with mode-dependent layers, leading to improved performance across diverse applications without altering the underlying architecture.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-context learning tabular foundation models, while state-of-the-art, suffer from quadratic complexity in dataset size due to their attention-based transformer architecture. We introduce TACO, a tabular compression model that compresses training data into a latent space, achieving up to 94x faster inference and 97% less memory usage compared to transformers, with comparable performance and better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity and associated overhead of existing in-context learning tabular foundation models, which limits their scalability to large datasets.

Method: TACO is an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset into a latent space.

Result: TACO is up to 94x faster in inference time and consumes up to 97% less memory compared to state-of-the-art tabular transformer architectures on the TabArena benchmark, while retaining performance and demonstrating better scalability with larger dataset sizes and improved performance over other baselines.

Conclusion: TACO offers a scalable and efficient alternative to existing tabular foundation models by compressing data in a latent space, outperforming transformers in speed and memory usage without significant performance degradation.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 行为评估是评估大型语言模型（LLM）对齐的主要方法，但这种从行为证据到潜在对齐的推断通常是隐含的且未经充分分析。本文将此问题形式化为部分可观察性下的可识别性问题，并引入了“对齐可验证性问题”和“规范不可区分性”的概念。研究表明，在有限的行为评估和存在评估意识的智能体环境下，观察到的行为合规性并不能唯一确定潜在的对齐性，即使是理想化的行为评估也不能普遍证明对齐性。因此，行为对齐测试应被视为不可区分性类别的估计器，而不是对齐性的验证器。通过更严格的测试可以缩小兼容假设的空间，但在特定条件下无法将其缩减为单个假设。这一定义了对齐基准测试提供了在特定评估体系内可观察合规性的上限，而非潜在对齐性的保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM对齐评估范式主要依赖于行为评估，但从观察到的行为推断潜在的对齐属性这一过程缺乏形式化分析，可能导致评估结果的不可靠性。

Method: 将LLM对齐评估形式化为部分可观察性下的可识别性问题，并引入了“对齐可验证性问题”和“规范不可区分性”的概念。在此框架下，研究了在有限评估和存在评估意识的智能体环境下的对齐性识别问题。

Result: 研究证明，在有限的行为评估和评估意识智能体存在的情况下，观察到的行为合规性并不能唯一地确定潜在的对齐性。即，即使是理想化的行为评估，也不能普遍地证实潜在的对齐属性。

Conclusion: 行为评估测试应被视为不可区分性类别的估计器，而非对齐性的验证器。在特定条件下，即使通过更严格的测试，也无法将兼容的假设空间缩减到单个假设。因此，对齐基准测试应被理解为提供了在给定评估体系内可观察合规性的上限，而不是对潜在对齐性的保证。

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注概率保证，缺乏对固定误差阈值下失败概率的量化，且多为有限时间结果，无法反映现代深度学习模型（通常训练数百万次迭代）的长期尾部衰减特性。本研究旨在弥补这些不足，提供更具信息量的长期尾部衰减保证。

Method: 本研究运用大偏差理论来分析随机梯度下降（SGD）和裁剪SGD（c-SGD）算法在非凸损失函数和不同噪声假设下的尾部行为。具体包括：1. 对SGD，在有界噪声下，推导出最佳迭代点梯度范数平方的长期尾部上界，衰减率为 $e^{-t/	ext{log}(t)}$。2. 对c-SGD，在重尾噪声（p阶矩存在，p ∈ (1,2]）下，推导出尾部上界，衰减率为 $e^{-t^{β_p}/	ext{log}(t)}$，其中 $β_p = rac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ (p ∈ (1,2)) 或 $e^{-t/	ext{log}^2(t)}$ (p=2)。3. 提供了尾部衰减的下界，衰减率为 $e^{-t}$，证明了所得上界的紧确性（在多对数因子内）。

Result: 本研究得到了SGD和c-SGD的长期尾部衰减上界，其衰减速率显著优于基于有限时间界限的现有结果。对于SGD，尾部衰减率为 $e^{-t/	ext{log}(t)}$；对于c-SGD，在重尾噪声下，衰减率为 $e^{-t^{β_p}/	ext{log}(t)}$ 或 $e^{-t/	ext{log}^2(t)}$。同时，本研究通过 $e^{-t}$ 的下界证明了所得上界的紧确性。结果表明，在某些情况下，尾部衰减速度比之前已知的快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 本研究通过大偏差理论成功量化了SGD和c-SGD的长期尾部衰减速率，并证明了这些速率的紧确性。研究结果表明，与基于有限时间界限的先前工作相比，这些算法在长期表现上具有更快的尾部衰减，从而为个体运行提供了更强的保证。这对于理解和优化在海量迭代下训练的现代机器学习模型至关重要。

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

### [150] [Stable but Wrong: When More Data Degrades Scientific Conclusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05668)
*Zhipeng Zhang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 数据驱动的科学研究可能因观测过程中的内在不可观测的可靠性下降而系统性地得出错误结论，即使在拥有更多数据、诊断检查正常的情况下也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学越来越依赖大型数据集和自动化推理流程，普遍认为更多数据能提高科学结论的可靠性。然而，本研究旨在揭示在特定情况下，这种信念可能失效。

Method: 通过最小化的合成实验，识别出一种结构性状态，在这种状态下，标准的推理程序虽然收敛平稳、校准良好并通过了常规诊断检查，但却系统性地收敛到错误结论。研究关注了观测可靠性以一种推理过程无法察觉的方式下降的情况。

Result: 在所识别的结构性状态下，增加数据并不能纠正错误，反而会放大错误。基于残差和拟合优度的诊断检查仍然显示出正常结果，具有误导性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的科学研究存在内在的局限性：稳定性、收敛性和置信度并不足以保证认识论的有效性。研究强调，推理过程不能仅仅依赖于数据的可用性，而必须受到观测过程完整性明确约束的指导。

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

### [151] [Perception-Based Beliefs for POMDPs with Visual Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05679)
*Miriam Schäfers,Merlijn Krale,Thiago D. Simão,Nils Jansen,Maximilian Weininger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为PBP的框架，用于解决高维观测空间中POMDPs的规划问题。PBP通过引入一个将视觉观测映射到状态概率分布的图像分类器，来弥补传统方法的不足，使得底层求解器无需直接处理高维观测空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于信念和滤波的POMDP求解器难以处理高维观测空间（如图像）的问题。

Method: 提出PBP框架，该框架包含一个图像分类器，将视觉观测映射到状态概率分布，并直接用于信念更新。研究还提出了不确定性量化方法来处理分类器的不精确性。

Result: PBP框架与标准信念更新在分类器精确时一致。通过实验证明，PBP优于现有的端到端深度强化学习方法，并且不确定性量化提高了PBP在视觉干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PBP框架能够有效解决高维观测空间中的POMDP问题，并且通过不确定性量化可以提高其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 进化搜索结合大型语言模型（LLM）被提出用于发现新的激活函数，这种方法能够探索更广阔的搜索空间，并且可以根据特定需求（如泛化能力）优化激活函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数的选择对模型优化和表达能力至关重要，手动设计的搜索空间存在局限性。

Method: 利用AlphaEvolve等包含LLM作为突变算子的现代流水线，在FLOP预算内搜索所有可能的Python函数作为激活函数，并将模型在分布外（out-of-distribution）数据的表现作为适应度函数，以发现具有特定归纳偏置的激活函数。

Result: 实验表明，即使在小规模合成数据集上，该方法也能发现有意义的激活函数，并且能够提升模型在分布外数据上的性能。

Conclusion: 进化搜索框架，特别是结合LLM和分布外数据评估，为发现新的、具有特定归纳偏置的激活函数提供了一种有效且灵活的途径。

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

*Arno Geimer,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Learning (FL)中，参与者贡献的准确评估面临挑战，因其估计存在固有的不稳定性，可能影响参与者的积极性。本研究提出了FedRandom，一种通过生成更多样本来解决此贡献不稳定性问题的新颖方法，从而提供更稳定可靠的贡献评估，并在多种数据集和分布下验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业界部署的联邦学习（FL）场景中，由于参与联合需要成本，参与者期望获得与其贡献相称的补偿。此外，评估参与者贡献对于识别恶意行为者和“搭便车者”至关重要。然而，公平评估个体贡献仍然是一个重大挑战。近期研究表明，在不同的聚合策略下，贡献估计存在显著的不稳定性，这可能对参与者的积极性产生负面影响。

Method: 本研究提出了一种名为FedRandom的新型缓解技术，将贡献不稳定性问题视为一个统计估计问题。FedRandom通过生成比常规FL策略更多的样本，从而能够获得更稳定可靠的参与者贡献评估。

Result: 通过在CIFAR-10、MNIST、CIFAR-100和FMNIST等数据集上进行实验，并采用不同的数据分布，研究表明FedRandom在超过一半的评估场景中将与真实值的整体距离减少了三分之一以上，并在超过90%的情况下提高了评估的稳定性。

Conclusion: FedRandom通过将贡献评估视为一个统计估计问题，并利用生成的额外样本来提高评估的稳定性，从而有效解决了联邦学习中贡献评估不稳定的问题。该方法在多种数据集和数据分布下均表现出优越的性能，为激励参与者和维护联邦学习系统的公平性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在子群体比例失衡的数据集上，机器学习中的“公平性促进准确性”和“公平性损害准确性”现象都可能是由于数据表示不准确所致。本文提出了一种插值重加权方法，并在实验中验证了该方法可以消除由数据表示不准确引起的伪影，从而揭示真实的公平性-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习实践者在预测准确性和群体公平性约束之间经常遇到矛盾，但有时公平性干预似乎能提高准确性。这两种现象都可能源于未能准确表示子群体比例的训练数据。

Method: 提出了一种插值重加权方法，该方法在目标分布和训练分布之间进行插值，以实现最优的有限样本校正。提出了一种可行的评估方案：在考虑公平性之前，先最优地固定数据表示，然后将公平性干预与收缩校正的基线进行比较，以分离出真实的、不可避免的公平性成本。

Result: 通过在合成和真实世界基准（Adult、COMPAS）上进行实验，验证了理论预测的准确性。该评估方案消除了由数据表示不准确引起的伪影，揭示了真实的公平性-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 在子群体比例失衡的数据集上，机器学习中的“公平性促进准确性”和“公平性损害准确性”现象都可能是由于数据表示不准确所致。本文提出了一种插值重加权方法，并在实验中验证了该方法可以消除由数据表示不准确引起的伪影，从而揭示真实的公平性-效用权衡。建议的评估协议有助于准确评估公平性干预的真实成本。

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

TL;DR: Muon 优化器在理论上比梯度下降 (GD) 更快，尤其是在处理具有不平衡频率成分的数据时，并且可以通过实验和理论分析得到验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon 优化器在实际应用中表现出了显著的优势，但其工作原理和扩展性在理论上尚不清楚。

Method: 研究了在具有噪声或无噪声的线性关联记忆模型中，Muon 优化器与梯度下降 (GD) 在频率谱上的表现。通过分析优化动态、收敛速度和扩展性，并将其与隐式矩阵预处理等理论模型进行对比。最后在合成长尾分类和 LLaMA 风格预训练任务上进行了实验验证。

Result: 在无噪声情况下，Muon 比 GD 收敛速度快指数倍。在有噪声情况下，Muon 的优化扩展性优于 GD。Muon 可被解释为一种隐式矩阵预处理，而基于坐标符号算子的预处理方法在理论上可以匹配 Muon 的性能，但在实践中不可行。

Conclusion: Muon 优化器在理论上具有更好的收敛速度和扩展性，尤其是在处理具有挑战性的数据集时。其性能可以通过隐式矩阵预处理来解释，并在各种实验任务中得到验证。

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

Motivation: 探究深度聚类（DC）方法，特别是深度嵌入聚类（DEC），在克服k-means聚类在发现任意形状、大小和密度簇方面的局限性方面的能力，并考察其对深度聚类方法的普遍意义。

Method: 通过对DEC的分析，揭示了现有深度聚类方法普遍存在的、未能利用数据分布信息的缺点。随后，提出了一种非深度学习方法，该方法利用簇的分布信息来解决k-means聚类的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，DEC未能有效克服k-means聚类在发现任意形状、大小和密度簇方面的局限性，并且现有深度聚类方法普遍未能利用数据的分布信息。提出的非深度学习方法能够有效解决这些局限性。

Conclusion: 深度学习表示学习并非克服k-means聚类基本局限性的必要条件。通过利用数据的分布信息，非深度学习方法同样可以实现深度聚类的目标，甚至可能更优。

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

Motivation: 在强化学习（RL）中，跨越具有不同动态的域适应策略仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 利用逆策略模型和奖励模型来校正源域转移中的动作和奖励，使其与目标域的动态明确对齐。此外，采用前向动力学模型来保留那些比原始转移更符合目标域动态的校正样本。

Result: 在具有动态变化的各种环境中进行实验，STC 表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: STC 算法能够可靠地利用源域数据进行策略适应，并在跨领域强化学习任务中取得优越性能。

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本地差分隐私（LDP）通过在源头扰动用户数据来提供强大的隐私保证。然而，LDP引入的噪声会降低数据效用。本文将LDP下的私有学习重新解释为迁移学习问题，提出了一种基于无噪声二元反馈的评估机制来估计数据集效用，并通过模型反转和模型平均来改进分类器性能。理论分析和实验结果均表明该方法能有效降低风险并提高分类准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过将LDP下的私有学习视为迁移学习问题，并结合提出的模型反转和模型平均技术，在不损害隐私的前提下，有效提高了分类性能，并降低了理论风险。

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

Motivation: 在计算断层扫描（CT）重建中，为深度学习方法提供一个原则性的置信度估计框架，以解决其可靠性和不确定性感知能力的问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为基于深度学习的CT重建提供了可靠的置信度估计，并具有理论保证。深度学习方法不仅是强大的估计器，而且是不确定性感知医学成像的可靠工具。

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

Motivation: 在局部曲率随次优性差距而减小的假设下，研究了自适应学习率调度的理论和实践。

Method: 提出了一种广义平滑性假设，并在此假设下建立了收敛保证，推导出了自然产生的预热后衰减的学习率调度策略。在此基础上，开发了一种实用的自适应学习率调度器，能够自动调整预热阶段的持续时间。

Conclusion: 开发了一种新颖的自适应学习率调度方法，该方法能够自动确定预热时长，并在大型语言模型预训练中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose a privacy-preserving synthetic data generation method inspired by GANs, using a fuzzer to generate data based on original data constraints and a discriminator to guide the generation process, achieving high utility and privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A need exists for synthetic datasets that match original data distributions without compromising confidentiality, as current GAN-based methods are either inaccurate or vulnerable to privacy attacks.

Method: A GAN-inspired approach where a test generator (fuzzer) creates data from input specifications while preserving original data constraints. A discriminator model assesses the similarity to the original data, guiding the evolution of 'good samples' for privacy-preserving generation.

Result: The proposed approach generates synthetic data with the same statistical distributions as the original dataset, leading to comparable utility. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's potential for high utility and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: The developed approach shows promise in generating privacy-preserving synthetic datasets that maintain high utility by indirectly leveraging original data through a constrained fuzzer and a discriminator-based evolution process.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: CFRecs 能够将反事实解释转化为可操作的见解，以帮助用户在购房和售房方面做出更好的决策。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

TL;DR: Transformer 架构的计算能力仍然有限，我们提出了一个使用 softmax、长度无关且多项式有界的位置编码，无需 layernorm 即可解决 PARITY 问题的 Transformer 新构造，并且该构造可以同时适用于有无因果掩码。此外，我们还首次证明了单层单头 Transformer 无法解决 PARITY 问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 架构的计算能力仍有待深入了解，特别是在解决特定问题（如 PARITY）的能力方面。

Method: 提出了一种新的 Transformer 构造方法，该方法使用 softmax、长度无关且多项式有界的位置编码，并且不需要 layernorm。该方法同时适用于有因果掩码和无因果掩码的情况。此外，还通过证明单层单头 Transformer 无法解决 PARITY 问题来推导了 PARITY 问题的 Transformer 下界。

Conclusion: Transformer 架构在解决 PARITY 问题上存在层数限制，单层 Transformer 无法解决此问题。提出的新构造为解决 PARITY 问题提供了一个更有效且更具实际意义的 Transformer 模型。

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于正则化非对称校准的渐进式舍入方法，在不显著增加计算成本的情况下，能够有效地提高LLM的量化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

Motivation: 判断基于样本的训练方法在多大程度上能够捕捉语言的真实结构（“世界模型”），并提出实用的工具来验证序列模型的健全性。

Method: 提出了一种名为“对抗性序列生成”的方法，通过生成有效的序列来迫使序列模型预测无效的下一步，从而验证模型的健全性。同时，研究了训练方法、数据集选择以及棋盘状态探针对模型健全性的影响。

Result: 在所评估的棋类模型中，没有模型是健全的。然而，某些训练技术和数据集选择能够显著提高模型的健全性。提取的棋盘状态在大多数模型的下一个词预测中没有起到因果作用。

Conclusion: 基于样本的训练无法完全捕捉语言的真实结构，对抗性序列生成是一种有效的验证模型健全性的方法，并且可以用于分析模型的故障模式。在棋类模型的研究中，虽然没有模型能达到完全健全，但通过优化训练策略和数据集可以改善模型性能。

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在训练后的过程中，会接触到各种各样的数据集，这些数据集可能包含一些除了预期目标之外的潜在模式，例如格式与内容的关联、不同问题中相似的措辞，以及数据收集过程中产生的隐性关联。这些模式对开发者来说可能并不明显，但对模型却十分重要，导致模型出现一些出乎意料的行为。我们将这种现象称为“块状训练”（chunky post-training），即模型学习到了由不同训练数据块产生的虚假关联。我们提出了一种名为SURF的工具，可以在运行时发现这些非预期的行为，以及一个名为TURF的工具，可以将这些失败追溯到特定的训练数据。通过在多种前沿模型（Claude 4.5、GPT-5.1、Grok 4.1、Gemini 3）和开源模型（Tülu 3）上应用这些工具，我们证明了块状训练会导致模型行为校准失常，其原因常常在于训练数据块的不平衡或定义不明确。

Conclusion: 块状训练会导致大型语言模型（LLM）出现校准失常的行为，这些行为源于训练数据中存在的虚假关联，而这些关联往往是不平衡或定义不明确的数据块所产生的。SURF和TURF工具能够有效地识别和追溯这些问题。

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要解决在LLM的巨大动作空间和有限的采样次数下，策略镜像下降（PMD）算法对可靠的分配函数估计的依赖性问题，以实现更实用的RL训练。 

Method: 提出了一种名为PMD-mean的算法，它用采样策略下的平均奖励来近似对数分配项，并在对数策略空间中进行回归。分析了PMD-mean的总体解决方案，并证明了它隐式地优化了一个具有自适应混合KL--$χ^2$正则化的镜面下降子问题。

Result: PMD-mean算法通过引入额外的$χ^2$正则化，在预期奖励低时约束大的概率变化，从而实现更保守的更新，并提高对有限样本估计误差的鲁棒性。在数学推理任务上的实验表明，PMD-mean比现有方法具有更高的性能、稳定性和时间效率。

Conclusion: PMD-mean通过近似对数分配项并引入自适应混合KL--$χ^2$正则化，克服了PMD在LLM训练中的挑战，在数学推理任务上表现出优越的性能、稳定性和效率，加深了对PMD-mean的理解，并为RL算法的改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

TL;DR: Flow and diffusion models struggle with post-training adaptation to user preferences (reward alignment). We introduce Diamond Maps, a new class of stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate reward alignment at inference time by amortizing simulation steps and preserving stochasticity. Experiments show Diamond Maps are learnable, outperform existing methods in reward alignment, and scale better, offering a practical way to adapt generative models to arbitrary preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow and diffusion models require costly and brittle adaptation to user preferences or constraints post-training, a problem known as reward alignment. The paper argues that efficient reward alignment should be an intrinsic property of the generative model itself.

Method: The paper proposes "Diamond Maps", a novel type of stochastic flow map model. These models are designed for adaptability, allowing for efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize simulation steps into a single-step sampler, similar to flow maps, while maintaining the stochasticity crucial for optimal reward alignment. This facilitates scalable search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance through efficient and consistent value function estimation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Diamond Maps can be trained efficiently through distillation from GLASS Flows. They achieve superior reward alignment performance and exhibit better scalability compared to existing methods. The results suggest a practical approach for generative models that can be quickly adjusted to diverse preferences and constraints during inference.

Conclusion: Diamond Maps offer a practical and efficient solution for adapting generative models to arbitrary user preferences and constraints at inference time, addressing the challenge of reward alignment by building adaptability directly into the model architecture.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

Conclusion: 适当实现的乐观主义可以稳定 Thompson sampling，并能在多臂老虎机中实现渐近有效的推断，同时只产生轻微的额外遗憾成本。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

TL;DR: Share是一种参数高效的持续微调方法，通过学习和动态更新单个共享的低秩子空间，实现了跨多个任务和模态的无缝适应，解决了灾难性遗忘和高昂的再训练成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际部署中，高效且持续地将大型预训练模型适应于新任务至关重要，但由于灾难性遗忘和高昂的再训练成本，这一直是一个挑战。现有的参数高效调优方法（如LoRA）虽然降低了计算需求，但缺乏严格的持续学习和知识整合机制，并且依赖于数据重放或多个适配器。

Method: Share构建了一个基础子空间，从中提取过去任务的核心知识，并通过识别关键子空间方向来逐步整合新信息。每个新任务的知识都被整合到这个不断演变的子空间中，促进知识的前向迁移，同时最大限度地减少灾难性干扰。

Result: Share实现了高达100倍的参数缩减和281倍的内存节省，性能与联合训练的模型相当。一个Share模型可以取代数百个特定任务的LoRA适配器，支持可扩展的、异步的持续学习。实验在图像分类、自然语言理解、3D姿态估计和文本到图像生成等任务上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Share通过学习和动态更新一个共享的低秩子空间，为大型AI系统提供了实用且可扩展的终身学习解决方案，能够跨任务和模态进行高效适应，并有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

Motivation: LLMs的参数量持续增长，导致参数高效微调（如LoRA）的参数数量减少可能不足以满足需求。

Method: 通过测量层对内部表征变化的影响来识别最相关的层，然后仅微调这些选定的层。

Result: 在编码器-仅模型上，GLUE基准测试的可训练参数减少了50%，预测性能下降可忽略不计；在解码器-仅模型上，在数学问题解决和编码任务上，性能下降很小甚至有所提升；在多模态模型上，也取得了与在所有层上使用LoRA模块进行微调相比具有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地微调LLM中的关键层，可以在显著减少计算成本的同时，保持甚至提高模型的性能。

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

*Leo Zhang,James Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) in Transformers can be unstable, especially in skipless architectures, leading to rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. This paper introduces Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), a novel mechanism that parameterizes the attention matrix to be orthogonal using a skew-symmetric matrix and matrix exponential. OSA avoids SSA's issues, enabling easier training of Transformers without skip connections and normalization layers. Its computational complexity scales linearly with sequence length, and a derived initialization scheme ensures a well-conditioned Jacobian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability of Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) in skipless Transformer architectures, which suffers from rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians, and to enable easier training of Transformers without skip connections and normalization layers.

Method: OSA parameterizes the attention matrix to be orthogonal by mapping a skew-symmetric matrix (formed from query-key values) through the matrix exponential. This method is practically implemented by exploiting the low-rank structure of query-key values, achieving linear scaling of computational complexity and memory cost with sequence length. An initialization scheme is derived to ensure a well-conditioned Jacobian.

Result: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA) successfully bypasses the instability issues of SSA. It allows for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalization layers to be trained more easily. The computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scale linearly with sequence length. The derived initialization scheme ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

Conclusion: OSA is a novel attention mechanism that addresses the limitations of SSA, offering improved stability and trainability for Transformer architectures, particularly in scenarios involving skipless connections and the absence of normalization layers. Its linear scaling and well-conditioned Jacobian make it a computationally efficient and robust alternative.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

*Yingke Li,Anjali Parashar,Enlu Zhou,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE). This paper provides the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that sufficient curiosity ensures both coherent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and efficient decision-making (no-regret optimization). The analysis connects AIF to Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization, offering practical guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid problems, validated by real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when the balance between epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) in Active Inference (AIF), achieved by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE) through a curiosity coefficient, leads to both coherent learning and efficient decision-making. The paper addresses the unclear conditions under which insufficient or excessive curiosity can hinder learning and decision-making.

Method: Establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents. Analyze the conditions under which sufficient curiosity ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Characterize the dependence of this mechanism on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment. Connect AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization. Translate theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems. Validate through real-world experiments.

Result: A single requirement, sufficient curiosity, is shown to simultaneously ensure self-consistent learning and no-regret optimization for EFE-minimizing agents. The analysis characterizes the dependence on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, bridging AIF with Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization. Practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off are developed and validated experimentally.

Conclusion: Sufficient curiosity is a key requirement for active inference agents to achieve both coherent learning and efficient decision-making. This finding unifies concepts from active inference, Bayesian experimental design, and Bayesian optimization under a single theoretical framework, providing practical insights for hybrid learning and optimization tasks.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离群检测方法在利用和聚合语言模型中的token嵌入以获得离群分数方面存在挑战，需要更有效的方法来处理高维数据。

Method: AP-OOD是一种半监督方法，它通过利用token级别的分数来超越简单的平均聚合，并在无监督和监督设置之间灵活插值，从而实现有限的辅助离群数据的利用。

Result: AP-OOD在文本离群检测方面取得了新的最先进成果。在无监督设置中，它将XSUM摘要上的FPR95从27.84%降低到4.67%，将WMT15英法翻译上的FPR95从77.08%降低到70.37%。

Conclusion: AP-OOD通过利用token级别的分数，为文本离群检测提供了一种超越简单平均聚合的新方法，并在半监督设置中展现出显著的性能提升，为可靠部署机器学习模型提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的预训练视觉-语言模型缺乏对物理世界的直观理解，而监督微调的效果有限，未能实现跨任务的泛化。

Method: 通过强化学习训练模型与环境进行交互，以学习物理动力学。

Result: 虽然交互式学习提高了模型在特定任务内的性能，但未能产生具有普遍物理直觉的模型。在同一任务或相似任务上训练的模型，即使在视觉统计和物理原理上相似，也无法可靠地泛化到新任务。

Conclusion: 单纯的监督微调或与环境的交互式学习（使用强化学习）不足以使模型获得可泛化的物理直觉。模型需要新的训练范式来学习鲁棒的物理规则。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

### [182] [Atomic Information Flow: A Network Flow Model for Tool Attributions in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04912)
*James Gao,Josh Zhou,Qi Sun,Ryan Huang,Steven Yoo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AIF is a graph-based network flow model that traces tool outputs and LLM calls to specific components in RAG systems. It uses a lightweight Gemma3 model trained on AIF signals to achieve high accuracy in identifying critical information and compressing context, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-based RAG systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components, which is a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures.

Method: AIF models LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atomic units of information (decomposed tool outputs and LLM calls) from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink. A lightweight Gemma3 model is trained as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF, inspired by the max-flow min-cut theorem.

Result: The trained Gemma3-4B model achieves 82.71% accuracy on HotpotQA (a +28.01 point improvement) and 87.52% context token compression (+1.85%), outperforming the base Gemma3-4B model (54.7% accuracy) and rivaling the larger Gemma3-27B variant.

Conclusion: AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability in RAG systems. Training a lightweight model on AIF signals significantly improves its ability to identify critical information and compress context, making it competitive with much larger models.

Abstract: Many tool-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components -- a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures. We present \textbf{Atomic Information Flow (AIF)}, a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into atoms: indivisible, self-contained units of information. By modeling LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink, AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability.
  Motivated by the max-flow min-cut theorem in network flow theory, we train a lightweight Gemma3 (4B parameter) language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF. We note that the base Gemma3-4B model struggles to identify critical information with \textbf{54.7\%} accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines (BM25). However, post-training on AIF signals boosts accuracy to \textbf{82.71\%} (+28.01 points) while achieving \textbf{87.52\%} (+1.85\%) context token compression -- bridging the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly $7\times$ larger.

TL;DR: 模型嵌入维度是影响密集检索性能的关键因素，但其对性能的影响规律尚不明确。本研究通过实验分析了不同模型家族和规模下嵌入维度与检索性能的关系，发现性能随嵌入维度的增加而提高，符合幂律关系。然而，在评估任务与训练任务不一致时，性能提升不再稳定，甚至可能下降。研究结果为选择合适的模型和嵌入维度提供了指导，有助于在效率和效果之间取得平衡。

Motivation: 随着密集检索任务复杂性的增加，其底层数据结构（向量）和相似性度量（内积）的局限性日益凸显。理解嵌入维度对密集检索性能的影响对于构建下一代检索模型至关重要。

Method: 本研究通过实验分析了两种模型家族和不同模型规模下的嵌入维度与检索性能的关系，旨在揭示嵌入维度对检索性能的影响规律。

Result: 研究发现，检索性能随嵌入维度的增加而提升，且这种提升符合幂律关系。对于与训练任务一致的评估任务，性能会持续提升，但边际效益递减。然而，对于与训练任务不一致的评估任务，性能提升不再可预测，某些情况下，较大的嵌入维度反而会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 嵌入维度是影响密集检索性能的关键因素，其影响规律符合幂律关系。研究结果为在存储和计算成本受限的情况下，选择合适的模型和嵌入维度以获得最佳性能提供了实际指导。

Abstract: Dense retrieval, which encodes queries and documents into a single dense vector, has become the dominant neural retrieval approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）系统虽然通过查询时适应（如查询扩展和迭代检索）来提高鲁棒性，但这些方法是无状态的，导致无法累积学习并产生重复的推理成本。另一方面，键扩展等索引端方法虽然具有持久性，但依赖于离线预处理或启发式更新，这与下游任务效用关联不强，并可能导致语义漂移和噪声累积。

Method: ERM（Evolving Retrieval Memory）框架通过以下方式更新检索索引：1. 正确性门控反馈：仅当检索结果正确时才进行反馈。2. 选择性归因：将原子扩展信号分配给它们所改进的文档键。3. 渐进式演进：通过稳定、范数约束的更新来改进文档键。

Result: 在BEIR和BRIGHT跨13个领域的实验表明，ERM在检索和生成方面均取得一致的提升，特别是在推理密集型任务上，并且检索速度与原生检索相同。

Conclusion: ERM框架能够将查询时适应的瞬时收益转化为持久的检索改进，并通过一种无需推理时开销即可将最佳查询扩展性能稳定到索引中的方法，实现了检索和生成任务的性能提升，尤其是在推理密集型任务上。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems commonly improve robustness via query-time adaptations such as query expansion and iterative retrieval. While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead. Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT across 13 domains demonstrate consistent gains in retrieval and generation, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, at native retrieval speed.

Abstract: Searching for mathematical results remains difficult: most existing tools retrieve entire papers, while mathematicians and theorem-proving agents often seek a specific theorem, lemma, or proposition that answers a query. While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of $9.2$ million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On a curated evaluation set of theorem-search queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale. The theorem search tool is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/spaces/uw-math-ai/theorem-search}{this link}, and the dataset is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/TheoremSearch}{this link}.

Abstract: Measuring advances in retrieval requires test collections with relevance judgments that can faithfully distinguish systems. This paper presents NeuCLIRTech, an evaluation collection for cross-language retrieval over technical information. The collection consists of technical documents written natively in Chinese and those same documents machine translated into English. It includes 110 queries with relevance judgments.

NeuCLIRTech combines the TREC NeuCLIR track topics of 2023 and 2024. The 110 queries with 35,962 document judgments provide strong statistical discriminatory power when trying to distinguish retrieval approaches. A fusion baseline of strong neural retrieval systems is included so that developers of reranking algorithms are not reliant on BM25 as their first stage retriever.

Conclusion: 多字段工具检索框架通过细粒度的多字段建模有效解决了现有工具检索方法的局限性，能够更好地匹配用户意图和工具表示，从而在处理大规模工具集时实现更优的性能。

Abstract: Integrating external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with real-world environments and solve complex tasks. Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling. Experimental results show that our framework achieves SOTA performance on five datasets and a mixed benchmark, exhibiting superior generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: The Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework improves search result ranking by modeling multifaceted user intents and incorporating rich side information like visual signals, outperforming baselines and showing significant online improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing re-ranking methods inadequately model multifaceted user intents and neglect rich side information (e.g., visual signals), limiting user search satisfaction.

Method: Proposes the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework: 1. Query Planner analyzes query refinement sequences to capture intents and decompose queries. 2. Integrates side information from candidate results, including visual content signals from a VLM-based evaluator. 3. Re-ranking considers content relevance, quality, information gain, novelty, and visual presentation. 4. LLM-based re-ranker performs holistic evaluation. 5. Enhances VLM and LLM capabilities via multi-task reinforcement learning for adaptability.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant outperformance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The framework has been deployed in an industrial search system, leading to substantial improvements in online user engagement and satisfaction.

Conclusion: The proposed Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework effectively enhances user search satisfaction by addressing limitations in existing methods through multi-dimensional modeling of user intents and integration of rich side information, demonstrating significant improvements both in experiments and in a large-scale industrial deployment.

Abstract: Re-ranking plays a crucial role in modern information search systems by refining the ranking of initial search results to better satisfy user information needs. However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着出版物数量的显著增加，收集与任何关键词相关的定义变得具有挑战性，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发了一个基于LLM的管道（SciDef），并测试了16种语言模型，采用多步和DSPy优化提示策略，并使用NLI等多种指标评估提取效果。

Result: LLM能够从科学文献中提取定义（测试集中86.4%），但存在过度生成的问题，未来工作应侧重于识别相关定义。

Conclusion: LLM在科学文献中提取定义方面表现出巨大潜力，但需要进一步改进以提高相关性的识别，并减少不必要的生成。

Abstract: Definitions are the foundation for any scientific work, but with a significant increase in publication numbers, gathering definitions relevant to any keyword has become challenging. We therefore introduce SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction. We test SciDef on DefExtra & DefSim, novel datasets of human-extracted definitions and definition-pairs' similarity, respectively. Evaluating 16 language models across prompting strategies, we demonstrate that multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting improve extraction performance. To evaluate extraction, we test various metrics and show that an NLI-based method yields the most reliable results. We show that LLMs are largely able to extract definitions from scientific literature (86.4% of definitions from our test-set); yet future work should focus not just on finding definitions, but on identifying relevant ones, as models tend to over-generate them.

Method: 提出LLM驱动的动机感知多模态推荐（LMMRec）框架。利用大型语言模型（LLM）通过链式思考提示提取细粒度的用户和物品动机。采用双编码器架构分别建模文本动机和交互动机，并通过动机协调策略与交互-文本对应方法进行对比学习和动量更新，以实现稳定的跨模态对齐并解决噪声和语义漂移问题。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，LMMRec相比现有方法，性能提升高达4.98%。

Conclusion: LMMRec框架能够有效融合多模态信息中的用户动机，提升推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Motivation-based recommendation systems uncover user behavior drivers. Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates. Experiments on three datasets show LMMRec achieves up to a 4.98\% performance improvement.

Conclusion: GLASS框架能够有效地将用户长期兴趣整合到生成过程中，显著提升了生成式推荐系统的性能，并且提出的解决方案有效解决了长序列建模和数据稀疏性问题。

Abstract: Leveraging long-term user behavioral patterns is a key trajectory for enhancing the accuracy of modern recommender systems. While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation.

Abstract: General-purpose text embedding models underpin a wide range of NLP and information retrieval applications, and are typically trained on large-scale multi-task corpora to encourage broad generalization. However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.

Conclusion: AgenticTagger通过有效的词汇构建和分配策略，解决了LLM在物品描述生成中的控制问题，显著提高了推荐系统的性能和效果。

Abstract: High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.

Conclusion: If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity.

TL;DR: DeepRead是一个利用文档结构进行长文档问答的智能体，通过将PDF转换为结构化Markdown，并在段落级别进行索引，利用“定位-阅读”的范式，提高了问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的智能体搜索框架在处理长文档时，通常将其视为扁平的文本块集合，未能充分利用文档固有的层级结构和顺序语篇结构。因此，需要一种能够显式利用这些先验知识的智能体来改进长文档问答。

Method: DeepRead首先使用基于LLM的光学字符识别（OCR）模型将PDF转换为保留标题和段落边界的结构化Markdown。然后，它在段落级别对文档进行索引，并为每个段落分配一个编码其章节身份和段内顺序的类坐标元数据键。在此基础上，DeepRead为LLM提供了两个工具：一个可以检索相关段落并暴露其结构坐标（带有轻量级扫描上下文）的检索工具，以及一个可以实现在指定章节和段落范围内进行连续、保持顺序的阅读的阅读章节工具。

Result: 实验表明，DeepRead在文档问答方面取得了比Search-o1风格的智能体搜索显著的改进。检索工具和阅读工具之间的协同效应也得到了验证。细粒度的行为分析揭示了一种类似于人类“定位-阅读”的行为模式。

Conclusion: DeepRead通过显式地将文档的结构信息（如层级和顺序）纳入其检索和阅读过程中，能够更有效地处理长文档问答任务，并模仿人类的阅读和推理策略。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents use a novel method called MINT to actively ask humans for information needed for planning in situations with incomplete knowledge, improving planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint planning between humans and AI is important but challenging due to incomplete information in open-world scenarios. AI agents need strategies to actively gather necessary information from humans to bridge these knowledge gaps.

Method: MINT, a neuro-symbolic approach, constructs a symbolic tree of potential human-AI interactions. It uses a neural network to estimate planning uncertainty arising from knowledge gaps and employs self-play to optimize the AI's information-elicitation strategies and queries. LLMs are used to analyze MINT's reasoning and generate optimal human-eliciting queries.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks with unknown objects demonstrated that MINT-based planning achieved near-expert returns, significantly improved rewards and success rates, and required only a limited number of questions per task.

Conclusion: MINT provides an effective method for AI agents to actively elicit human input in object-driven planning tasks with knowledge gaps, leading to improved planning performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在支持数学严谨性方面的可靠性，特别是在图论领域，因为它们越来越多地被用于学术目的。

Method: 采用一个包含解释、探索、策略制定和证明构建等八个阶段的评估协议，对LLM在两个图论问题上的表现进行了测试：一个已解决的关于线图优雅性的问题和一个开放性问题。

Result: 对于已解决的问题，LLM能够提供正确的定义、识别相关结构、准确回忆知识且不产生幻觉，并构建了有效的证明。对于开放性问题，LLM能够生成合理的解释和探索策略，但未能取得实质性进展，并且能够承认不确定性，避免捏造未经证实的说法。

Conclusion: LLM能够辅助学生探索已知知识，但在需要新颖数学见解或结构推理的任务方面存在局限性。在计算教学中，应引导学生利用LLM进行概念探索，同时强调独立验证和严格论证在正式问题解决中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

Motivation: 尽管AI聊天机器人提供了心理支持的潜力，但其安全性是首要问题。因此，需要一个基于证据的自动化安全评估基准，即 VERA-MH。

Method: 研究模拟了用户-AI聊天机器人对话，由临床医生和AI评估者使用评分标准对对话进行安全性评分，并评估了用户模拟的真实性。然后比较了临床医生之间以及临床医生与AI评估者之间的一致性。

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

### [200] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI对齐方法（如RLHF）依赖于人类评价者，但这些评价者通常是便利样本，存在人口统计学偏差。本研究提出了民主偏好优化（DemPO）框架，该框架使用算法抽签（类似于公民大会的机制）来进行基于偏好的微调。DemPO提供两种训练方案：硬面板（Hard Panel）仅使用抽签抽样的、满足配额的‘迷你公众’的偏好进行训练；软面板（Soft Panel）保留所有数据，但根据抽签机制下的包含概率对评价者进行加权。研究证明，软面板加权在数学上等同于硬面板目标。通过使用包含评价者人口统计学信息和美国代表性公众的75条款宪法的公开偏好数据集，在10亿至80亿参数的Llama模型上评估了DemPO。结果显示，硬面板方案效果最好，软面板方案优于未加权基线，且模型容量越大，效果越显著。这表明在收集偏好时强制执行人口统计学代表性，比事后修正更能使模型行为反映代表性公众的价值观。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于偏好的AI对齐方法（如RLHF）依赖于便利抽样的人类评价者，这导致了评价者在人口统计学上的系统性偏差，无法准确反映广泛公众的价值观。需要一种方法来解决这种偏差，确保AI系统学习到的价值观更具代表性。

Method: 提出了一种名为民主偏好优化（DemPO）的框架，该框架将算法抽签机制（用于构建公民大会）应用于基于偏好的微调。DemPO包含两种训练方案：1. 硬面板（Hard Panel）：仅使用通过抽签抽样、满足配额的‘迷你公众’所提供的偏好数据进行训练。2. 软面板（Soft Panel）：保留所有收集到的偏好数据，但根据抽签机制下每个评价者的包含概率对其进行加权。研究还从数学上证明了软面板加权方案能够恢复硬面板方案的目标。

Result: 使用包含评价者人口统计学信息和来自美国代表性公众的75条款宪法的公开偏好数据集，对10亿至80亿参数的Llama模型进行了评估。在六种不同的聚合方法下，硬面板方案的评估结果始终最优，软面板方案的评估结果优于未加权基线。并且，随着模型容量（参数量）的增加，DemPO方案的效果提升越发显著。

Conclusion: 在偏好收集阶段就强制执行人口统计学代表性，比事后进行修正，能够生成更准确地反映代表性公众价值观的模型。DemPO框架为解决AI对齐中的代表性问题提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

*Keyang Xuan,Pengda Wang,Chongrui Ye,Haofei Yu,Tal August,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为SocialVeil的交互环境，用于模拟和评估大型语言模型（LLM）在存在沟通障碍（如语义模糊、文化不匹配、情感干扰）的真实世界场景中的社交智能。实验表明，这些障碍会显著降低LLM的交互质量（ mutual understanding降低45%，unresolved confusion升高50%），并且现有的适应策略（如修复指令和交互式学习）效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）评估基准通常假设理想化的通信条件，无法准确评估LLM在现实世界不完美环境下的社交智能，尤其是在维持和修复交互方面。本研究旨在弥合这一差距，通过引入一个能够模拟认知差异导致沟通障碍的社交学习环境。

Method: 该研究提出了名为SocialVeil的社交学习环境，该环境能模拟由认知差异引起的三种沟通障碍：语义模糊、社会文化不匹配和情感干扰。研究还引入了两种评估指标：未解决的混淆和相互理解。通过在720个场景中对四种前沿LLM进行实验，并结合人类评估来验证模拟障碍的真实性，同时测试了修复指令和交互式学习策略的效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，沟通障碍显著降低了LLM的性能，平均而言，相互理解降低超过45%，未解决的混淆提高近50%。人类评估证实了模拟障碍的有效性（ICC≈0.78, Pearson r≈0.80）。此外，适应性策略（修复指令和交互式学习）对改善性能的效果有限，远未达到无障碍条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入SocialVeil环境和相应的评估指标，为评估LLM在不完美通信条件下的社交智能提供了新的途径，使得交互环境更接近真实世界，并揭示了当前LLM在应对沟通障碍方面仍存在局限性，适应性策略的效果有待提高。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在数据稀疏、跨城市交通预测中，我们提出了CAST-CKT框架，通过混沌分析、自适应时空建模和跨城市知识转移来克服挑战，并在实验中取得了显著优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀疏、跨城市交通预测面临复杂非线性动力学和域转移的挑战，现有方法难以捕捉交通的混沌性质以实现有效的少样本学习。

Method: 本研究提出了一种名为CAST-CKT的新型混沌感知时空跨城市知识转移框架。该框架采用混沌分析器量化交通可预测性状态，并引入混沌感知注意力机制进行状态自适应的时间建模，以及自适应拓扑学习来处理动态空间依赖关系，并通过基于混沌一致性的跨城市对齐进行知识转移。此外，该框架还能提供具有不确定性量化的特定预测时间范围的预测。

Result: 在四个跨城市少样本交通预测基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAST-CKT在平均绝对误差（MAE）和均方根误差（RMSE）方面显著优于最先进的方法，同时还能提供可解释的状态分析。

Conclusion: CAST-CKT框架通过整合混沌分析、自适应时空建模和跨城市知识转移，有效解决了数据稀疏和跨城市交通预测的难题，并在实验中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

TL;DR: HugRAG通过因果门控实现分层模块间的知识组织，以增强基于图的检索增强生成（RAG），从而实现可扩展的因果推理，并优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的RAG方法过度依赖表面节点匹配，缺乏明确的因果建模，导致答案不准确或虚假。现有的因果方法仅限于局部或单文档上下文，且信息隔离阻碍了可扩展性和跨模块因果推理。

Method: 提出HugRAG框架，通过分层模块间的因果门控来重构知识组织，明确建模因果关系以抑制虚假相关性，并实现大规模知识图的可扩展推理。

Result: 实验证明HugRAG在多个数据集和评估指标上持续优于竞争性的基于图的RAG基线。

Conclusion: HugRAG为结构化、可扩展且符合因果的RAG系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 检索增强生成（RAG）在处理包含多个异构知识库（KB）的领域时面临挑战，尤其是在中医藏医领域，百科条目可能主导检索，即使经典或临床论文提供了更权威的证据。本文研究了一个包含百科、经典和临床论文三个知识库以及一个包含500个查询的基准测试，并提出了DAKS（用于知识库路由和预算检索）和对齐图（用于证据融合和覆盖感知打包）两种方法，以提高可追溯性、减少幻觉并实现跨知识库验证。实验表明，该系统在路由质量和跨知识库证据覆盖方面均有提升，并在保持高忠实度和引用正确性的同时，实现了最佳的CrossEv@5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多知识库场景下，特别是中藏医药领域，知识库的异构性（如百科条目易匹配但权威性较低，经典和临床论文权威性高但匹配难度大）导致检索偏差，影响问答系统的准确性和可靠性。需要一种方法来平衡不同类型知识库的检索，并有效利用跨知识库的证据。

Method: 1. DAKS：设计了一种知识库路由机制，根据查询的特点将查询引导至最相关的知识库；同时采用预算检索策略，在有限的检索预算内，优先从权威性知识库获取证据，以缓解因百科条目密度高而产生的检索偏差。 2. 对齐图：构建一个对齐图来表示不同知识库中证据之间的关系，指导证据的融合过程，并使用覆盖感知打包技术，在不进行简单拼接的情况下，提高跨知识库证据的覆盖率。

Result: 通过在包含500个查询（涵盖单知识库和跨知识库问题）的基准测试上进行实验，证明了DAKS在路由质量上的提升，以及对齐图在提高跨知识库证据覆盖方面的有效性。最终的完整系统在保持高忠实度和引用正确性的前提下，取得了最佳的CrossEv@5指标。

Conclusion: 所提出的DAKS和对齐图方法能够有效解决多异构知识库下的检索增强生成问题，通过智能的知识库路由、预算检索以及优化的证据融合与打包，显著提高了问答系统的性能，尤其是在跨知识库验证和证据覆盖方面，为中藏医药等领域提供了更可靠的问答解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

*Guozhi Liu,Weiwei Lin,Tiansheng Huang,Ruichao Mo,Qi Mu,Xiumin Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过利用注意力汇聚点（attention sink）机制，提出了一种名为Surgery的微调阶段防御方法，通过抑制汇聚点散度（sink divergence）来降低模型学习有害模式的趋势，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的防御性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有害微调（harmful fine-tuning）会危及大语言模型的安全对齐，带来严重的安全风险。

Method: 提出并测量了‘汇聚点散度’（sink divergence）这一统计量，发现在有害微调过程中，正汇聚点散度（positive sink divergence）的注意力头数量会随模型有害性的增加而增加。基于‘可分离汇聚点散度假设’（separable sink divergence hypothesis），即与学习有害模式相关的注意力头可以通过其汇聚点散度的符号来区分，提出了一种名为Surgery的微调阶段防御方法。Surgery使用一种用于汇聚点散度抑制的正则化器，将注意力头引导至负汇聚点散度组，从而减少模型学习和放大有害模式的倾向。

Result: Surgery在BeaverTails、HarmBench和SorryBench基准测试中，防御性能分别提高了5.90%、11.25%和9.55%。

Conclusion: Surgery是一种有效的微调阶段防御方法，能够通过抑制注意力头的汇聚点散度来减轻有害微调带来的安全风险，并显著提升模型的安全性。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 余弦相似度受限于捕捉线性关系，本文提出recos度量，通过对向量分量排序后进行归一化，放宽了对完美相似性的要求，能捕捉更广泛的关系，并在实验中优于余弦相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的余弦相似度受限于向量空间中的线性关系，无法有效捕捉现实世界语义空间的复杂非线性结构。

Method: 通过推导点积的更紧界限，得到recos相似性度量，该度量通过对排序后的向量分量进行归一化来调整点积。

Result: 在11种不同类型的嵌入模型上的实验表明，recos在语义文本相似性（STS）基准测试中，与人类判断的相关性始终优于余弦相似度。

Conclusion: recos是一种在数学上合理且经验上更优的替代方案，为复杂嵌入空间的语义分析提供了更高的准确性。

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

TL;DR: LLM在安全管理中可能产生幻觉，本文提出一种框架，通过迭代和外部反馈来控制幻觉并优化决策，在事件响应中将恢复时间减少了30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在安全管理中潜力巨大，但幻觉问题阻碍了其应用，需要一种方法来解决此问题。

Method: 提出一个框架，将LLM整合到迭代循环中，生成候选动作，通过系统约束和前瞻性预测进行一致性检查。当一致性低时，收集外部反馈（如数字孪生评估）以通过上下文学习（ICL）改进候选动作，从而控制幻觉风险并限制ICL的遗憾。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在事件响应场景中，相比前沿LLM，恢复时间最多可减少30%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成LLM、迭代反馈和ICL，有效控制了安全管理中的幻觉风险，并提高了决策效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

*Ruijie Shi,Houbin Zhang,Yuecheng Han,Yuheng Wang,Jingru Fan,Runde Yang,Yufan Dang,Huatao Li,Dewen Liu,Yuan Cheng,Chen Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We introduce Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR) and AgentXRay, a framework to create interpretable 'white-box' workflows from 'black-box' agentic systems using only input-output data. AgentXRay uses a search-based approach with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Red-Black Pruning to optimize workflow structures, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems are often opaque 'black boxes,' making them difficult to interpret and control. There's a need for frameworks that can create explicit, understandable workflows from these systems.

Method: AgentXRay formulates the task of reconstructing agentic workflows as a combinatorial optimization problem. It searches over discrete agent roles and tool invocations within a chain-structured workflow space. The search is guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search, enhanced with a Red-Black Pruning mechanism that balances proxy metric quality and search depth. This method does not require access to the original model's parameters.

Result: AgentXRay successfully synthesizes interpretable, editable workflows that approximate the behavior of black-box systems. Experiments show improved proxy similarity (a measure of how well the reconstructed workflow matches the target output) and reduced token consumption compared to unpruned search methods. It allows for deeper exploration of workflows within given computational budgets.

Conclusion: AgentXRay provides an effective method for creating interpretable agentic workflows from opaque systems. Its search-based approach with pruning enhances efficiency and performance, making complex agentic systems more transparent and controllable.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

### [210] [RaBiT: Residual-Aware Binarization Training for Accurate and Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05367)
*Youngcheon You,Banseok Lee,Minseop Choi,Seonyoung Kim,Hyochan Chong,Changdong Kim,Youngmin Kim,Dongkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Residual binarization methods like RaBiT can achieve efficient LLM deployment through techniques that avoid performance degradation, such as algorithmic enforcement of a residual hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of LLMs demands extreme quantization, which often compromises performance. Existing methods like residual binarization face challenges with feature co-adaptation, where parallel paths learn redundant features, hindering error compensation and model expressiveness. This paper addresses the issue of inter-path adaptation in residual binarization.

Method: The paper introduces RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that enforces a residual hierarchy to resolve feature co-adaptation. Its core mechanism involves sequentially deriving each binary path from a shared full-precision weight, ensuring each path corrects the errors of the previous one. This process is further stabilized by a robust initialization strategy that prioritizes functional preservation. The framework enables matmul-free inference using binary (±1) layers.

Result: RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art performance that rivals hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods. It provides a 4.49x inference speed-up compared to full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Conclusion: RaBiT offers an effective solution to the feature co-adaptation problem in residual binarization, enabling highly efficient and performant LLM deployment. It achieves superior accuracy and significant speed-up, setting a new benchmark for 2-bit quantization.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Motivation: 眼科领域中的领域特定大语言模型在患者教育、分诊和临床决策支持中的应用日益广泛，因此对其进行严格评估以确保安全性和准确性至关重要。

Method: 本研究采用横断面研究设计，180个眼科患者咨询由四种参数量小于100亿的模型（Meerkat-7B、BioMistral-7B、OpenBioLLM-8B和MedLLaMA3-v20）进行回答，共生成2160个响应。使用S.C.O.R.E.框架（评估安全性、共识和背景、客观性、可重复性和可解释性）对模型响应进行评分，评分等级为五点李克特量表。三名不同资历的眼科医生和GPT-4-Turbo参与了评估。采用Spearman秩相关、Kendall tau统计和核密度估计分析评估大语言模型评分与临床医生评分之间的一致性。

Result: Meerkat-7B表现最佳，其平均得分分别为：资深顾问4.08分，顾问3.44分，住院医师4.18分。MedLLaMA3-v20表现最差，25.5%的响应包含幻觉或临床误导性内容，甚至虚构术语。GPT-4-Turbo的评分与临床医生评估总体上高度一致（Spearman rho为0.80，Kendall tau为0.67），但资深顾问的评分更为保守。

Conclusion: 医学大语言模型在眼科问答方面显示出安全应用的潜力，但在临床深度和共识方面仍存在不足。基于大语言模型的评估方法在大规模基准测试中是可行的，并且结合自动评估和临床医生审查的混合框架对于指导安全的临床应用是必要的。

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

### [212] [Advancing Opinion Dynamics Modeling with Neural Diffusion-Convection-Reaction Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05403)
*Chenghua Gong,Yihang Jiang,Hao Li,Rui Sun,Juyuan Zhang,Tianjun Gu,Liming Pan,Linyuan Lü*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We introduce OPINN, a novel physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling that integrates local, global, and endogenous factors using a Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system and Neural ODEs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing opinion dynamics models struggle to integrate mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, often using incomplete priors and inadequate constraint methods that hinder physical transparency.

Method: We propose a new opinion dynamics model based on the Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. This model, termed OPINN, leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, enabling a deeper encoding of these priors than traditional penalty-based methods.

Result: OPINN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in forecasting opinion evolution when evaluated on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OPINN presents a promising new paradigm for modeling opinion dynamics by effectively bridging cyber, physical, and social systems through a physics-informed neural network approach.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

### [214] [THOR: Inductive Link Prediction over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05424)
*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THOR是一种用于超关系知识图谱（HKG）的归纳链接预测技术，通过构建关系和实体基础图，并使用图编码器和Transformer解码器进行建模，实现了在不同数据集上的显著性能提升，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超关系知识图谱链接预测技术主要在转导设置下进行，限制了模型在未见过的词汇上的泛化能力。因此，需要一种能够处理超关系知识图谱并支持归纳推理的技术。

Method: THOR首先引入了关系和实体基础图，对HKG中的事实进行建模，这些基础图不依赖于任何特定的关系和实体。然后，THOR利用两个并行的图编码器和Transformer解码器从这两个基础图学习，支持掩码训练和完全归纳推理。

Result: 在12个不同设置的数据集上进行评估，THOR在超关系链接预测任务上表现优于现有方法，相比于表现最佳的基于规则、半归纳和全归纳技术，分别提高了66.1%、55.9%和20.4%。消融研究也验证了其关键设计因素在捕捉跨HKG结构不变性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: THOR成功实现了超关系知识图谱的归纳链接预测，并通过基础图和Transformer架构设计，显著提高了模型的泛化能力和预测性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注 GUI 用户行为轨迹数据成本高、质量差、丰富性不足，阻碍了强大的 GUI 智能体的发展。

Method: 提出 M$^2$-Miner 框架，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和多智能体（InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, JudgeAgent）协作进行数据挖掘。设计了意图回收策略以丰富数据，并采用渐进式模型 in-the-loop 训练策略提高挖掘成功率。

Conclusion: M$^2$-Miner 框架能够低成本、高质量、丰富地挖掘移动 GUI 智能体交互轨迹数据，显著提升了 GUI 智能体的性能，并且计划开源以促进社区研究。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

*Kritchanat Ponyuenyong,Pengyu Tu,Jia Wei Tan,Wei Soon Cheong,Jamie Ng Suat Ling,Lianlian Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 电力价格预测（EPF）对能源市场参与者至关重要，但由于价格信号固有的波动性和非线性而充满挑战。本研究提出了一种尖峰正则化策略，并评估了多种时间序列基础模型（TSFM），包括Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs)、MOIRAI、MOMENT和TimesFM。与ARIMA、LSTM和CNN-LSTM等传统模型相比，TSFM在新加坡的半小时批发市场数据上表现出更优越的性能，在考虑了天气和日历变量等外部因素后，平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）最多可提高37.4%，为提高波动性电力市场的预测准确性和决策提供了实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时间序列基础模型（TSFM）在一般时间序列预测任务中表现出色，但它们在波动性电力市场进行日前电力价格预测（EPF）方面的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 本研究提出了一种尖峰正则化策略，并使用新加坡的半小时批发市场数据（包含波动性趋势）评估了包括TTMs、MOIRAI、MOMENT和TimesFM在内的多种TSFM，并与ARIMA、LSTM和CNN-LSTM等传统模型进行了比较。在适用时，还整合了天气和日历变量等外部因素。

Result: 研究结果表明，TSFM在所有评估设置中均持续优于传统方法，在MAPE方面最多可提高37.4%。

Conclusion: 时间序列基础模型（TSFM）在波动性电力市场的日前电力价格预测中表现出优越性，能够显著提高预测准确性，为能源市场参与者提供了实用的决策支持。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Motivation: 提取标准特定的特征以实现定制化任务，但现有方法对子空间基敏感且易受干扰。

Method: 提出OD-CRL框架，结合自适应正交基优化（AOBO）和零空间去噪投影（NSDP）。AOBO通过SVD和基于曲率的截断构建正交语义基。NSDP通过将嵌入投影到无关子空间的零空间来抑制非目标语义干扰。

Result: OD-CRL在定制化聚类、定制化分类和定制化检索任务上实现了新的最先进性能，并具有优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OD-CRL框架有效解决了现有条件表示学习方法的局限性，并在多个下游任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

*Yiwen Duan,Jing Ye,Xinpei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALIVE是一个无需人工干预的对齐框架，通过生成性反馈学习，使LLM能够获得内在的推理能力，从而克服了传统奖励信号的局限性，并在多个推理基准上取得了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习（RL）依赖于标量奖励，这种奖励在扩展、跨领域泛化和对解决方案逻辑的理解方面存在成本高、脆弱和盲区等问题，阻碍了大型语言模型（LLMs）在专家级推理方面的提升。需要一种新的方法来克服这些奖励信号的限制，使模型能够获得深层次的、自包含的推理理解。

Method: ALIVE框架基于“认知协同”原理，将问题提出、解决和判断整合到单一策略模型中，以内化正确性逻辑。它结合了对抗学习和指导性语言反馈，使模型能够直接从原始语料库中内化评估标准，将外部批评转化为内化推理能力。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和一般逻辑推理基准的实证评估中，ALIVE框架一致地缓解了奖励信号的局限性。与使用相同数据和计算资源的模型相比，ALIVE在准确性、跨领域泛化能力和自我纠正率方面取得了显著的提升。

Conclusion: ALIVE框架通过“推理三元组”促进了能力增长的自我维持轨迹，为通用推理对齐提供了一个可扩展的基础，且无需人工监督。

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Phi-former的药物发现新方法，通过模拟分子片段（基序）在预测化合物-蛋白质相互作用（CPIs）中的作用，提高了预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的药物发现过程耗时耗力且成本高昂。预测化合物-蛋白质相互作用（CPIs）是关键环节，但现有深度学习方法未能充分考虑生物识别的基本单位——分子片段（基序）。

Method: 提出Phi-former，一种成对分层交互表示学习方法。该方法将化合物和蛋白质进行分层表示，并通过原子-原子、基序-基序、原子-基序三个层级的成对预训练框架来学习相互作用，模拟生物识别过程。设计了内部和跨层级的学习流程，使不同层级的学习相互促进。

Result: Phi-former在CPI相关任务上取得了优越的性能。案例研究表明，该方法能够准确识别CPIs中起关键作用的特定原子或基序，为模型提供了可解释的依据。

Conclusion: Phi-former通过整合分子片段的生物学作用，提高了CPIs预测的准确性和可解释性，有望指导合理药物设计并支持精准医疗。

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

*Hanyu Wei,Zunhai Su,Peng Lu,Chao Li,Spandan Tiwari,Ashish Sirasao,Yuhan Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speculative decoding with LLMs is slow due to latency. SDFP uses FIT-based layer pruning to create a lightweight draft model from an LLM without retraining, achieving 1.32x-1.5x speedup with no change in output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs causes latency in interactive multimedia applications. Existing speculative decoding methods require costly or complex draft model training and maintenance.

Method: SDFP, a training-free and plug-and-play framework, constructs a draft model by pruning layers of a given LLM based on Fisher Information Trace (FIT) to identify low-impact layers. This compact draft model is compatible with the original LLM for speculative verification.

Result: SDFP achieves 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup on benchmarks without changing the target model's output distribution.

Conclusion: SDFP offers a rapid, deployment-friendly, and training-free solution for constructing draft models for speculative decoding, enabling low-latency LLM applications without the overhead of traditional methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

TL;DR: SPT通过微调一个“诚实人格”到LoRA参数中，并在正常操作后激活它来审查模型响应，从而检测大型语言模型的失准行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测大型语言模型（LLM）的失准行为具有挑战性，因为模型可能会在训练过程中隐藏不良行为。标准的审计技术，如黑盒方法和机制可解释性，在应对LLM不断增长的能力方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为“分裂人格训练”（SPT）的方法，该方法在LoRA参数中微调了一个“诚实人格”。在主模型响应后，激活LoRA适配器并插入触发字符串，使诚实人格能够审查响应，同时访问主模型的潜在状态。

Result: 在Anthropic审计游戏模型生物基准测试中，SPT在Llama-3.3-70B模型上实现了96%的总体准确率，用于检测和揭示被训练来利用奖励机制并隐藏该行为的模型。相比之下，Anthropic报告的准确率接近0%。

Conclusion: SPT能够有效地检测LLM的失准行为，并揭示外部观察者无法访问的内部信息，例如模型被训练上的虚构偏见。

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

### [223] [Conditional Diffusion Guidance under Hard Constraint: A Stochastic Analysis Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05533)
*Zhengyi Guo,Wenpin Tang,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We present a new framework for conditional generation in diffusion models that guarantees generated samples satisfy hard constraints, using Doob's h-transform and martingale theory. We also introduce two off-policy learning algorithms to estimate the necessary components and provide theoretical guarantees on the sampler's accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods for diffusion models do not guarantee satisfaction of hard constraints, which are crucial for safety-critical applications and rare-event simulation. This work addresses this limitation by developing a principled framework for conditional diffusion guidance under hard constraints.

Method: The proposed framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, employing Doob's h-transform, martingale representation, and quadratic variation process. The guided dynamics augment a pre-trained diffusion model with an explicit drift correction term derived from the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function. Two novel off-policy learning algorithms are proposed to estimate the required components (h and its gradient) using trajectories from the pre-trained model, based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss.

Result: The paper provides non-asymptotic guarantees for the conditional sampler, quantifying the effects of errors in score approximation and guidance estimation in both total variation and Wasserstein distances. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating samples for rare events.

Conclusion: The developed framework and learning algorithms enable diffusion models to generate samples that strictly adhere to hard constraints, showing promise for applications requiring guaranteed outcomes and rare-event simulation.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

*Stephen Pilli,Vivek Nallur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can accurately predict and emulate individual-level cognitive biases in decision-making, even under varying cognitive loads, by analyzing human interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can predict individual-level cognitive biases and simulate the dynamics of biased human behavior under contextual factors like cognitive load.

Method: Adapted three decision-making scenarios into a conversational setting, conducted a human experiment (N=1100) with a chatbot under simple or complex dialogue conditions, and then simulated these conditions using LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) with participant demographics and dialogue transcripts.

Result: Observed robust biases in human participants. LLMs reproduced human biases with high precision, though differences were noted in how each model aligned with human behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate a significant capability to emulate human decision-making biases in interactive contexts, which has implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

*Subhadip Maji,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Despite advances in NLP, low-resource languages struggle due to data scarcity. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer helps by leveraging high-resource languages. This paper introduces GETR, a GNN-based method, which significantly outperforms baselines on POS tagging, sentiment classification, and NER for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing effective NLP systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to data scarcity. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer is a promising approach.

Method: Introduced GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation), a novel GNN-based method for cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and compared it with two baselines: augmentation in hidden layers and token embedding transfer through token translation. Focused on sentence-level and word-level tasks.

Result: GETR significantly outperformed baselines, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on POS tagging for Mizo and Khasi, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on sentiment classification and NER for simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam). A detailed analysis of transfer mechanisms was also presented.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based GETR approach is effective for cross-lingual knowledge transfer to low-resource languages, significantly improving performance on various NLP tasks.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

*Simon Kohaut,Benedict Flade,Julian Eggert,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Exact inference for dynamic probabilistic models is computationally expensive. This paper introduces Resin, a probabilistic programming language, and Reactive Circuits (RCs), a data structure for efficient, exact inference in these models. RCs adapt to input signal volatility, partitioning computations and re-evaluating only affected components, leading to significant speedups in drone swarm simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for exact inference in probabilistic models are computationally expensive, especially for autonomous agents in dynamic environments requiring real-time belief updates. These methods fail to exploit the heterogeneous update rates of real-world information streams.

Method: The paper proposes Resin, a probabilistic programming language merging probabilistic logic with reactive programming. For efficient and exact semantics, it introduces Reactive Circuits (RCs), which are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams. RCs adapt autonomously based on input signal volatility by partitioning computations according to the estimated frequency of change in asynchronous inputs.

Result: In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, the proposed approach achieved several orders of magnitude speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. The structural adaptations of RCs were shown to effectively capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and enabling reactive real-time reasoning. The method decomposes large inference tasks into memoized sub-problems, re-evaluating only affected components.

Conclusion: Reactive Circuits (RCs) provide an efficient and exact method for probabilistic reasoning in dynamic environments by autonomously adapting to input signal volatility. This approach significantly reduces redundant computations in streaming contexts, enabling faster and more reactive real-time reasoning for applications like autonomous agents.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

### [227] [Generative Ontology: When Structured Knowledge Learns to Create](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05636)
*Benny Cheung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Ontology combines ontologies and LLMs to create structured, novel artifacts by using ontologies as a grammar to constrain LLM creativity, with a multi-agent pipeline and RAG for validation and grounding. Demonstrated via GameGrammar for generating complete tabletop games, it generalizes to other domains like music and software architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ontologies lack novelty generation, while LLMs lack structural validity. The motivation is to synthesize their complementary strengths for creating novel, structurally sound artifacts.

Method: Generative Ontology uses Pydantic schemas as executable constraints for LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline with specialized roles and 'anxieties' assigns tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds designs in existing exemplars, and iterative validation ensures coherence.

Result: The framework successfully generated complete, playable tabletop game specifications (mechanisms, components, victory conditions, setup instructions) for thematic prompts, satisfying ontological constraints while remaining creative. Demonstrated through GameGrammar.

Conclusion: Generative Ontology provides a framework for structured, creative generation by using ontological constraints to guide LLMs. This approach generalizes to various domains and argues that constraints enable, rather than limit, creativity.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems. All the related resources, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphMemory.

TL;DR: LLM推理能效并非输入输出长度的线性函数，存在“最优区域”，优化序列长度可显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理的能耗对AI应用至关重要，现有基于输入输出序列长度的线性估算方法未能捕捉到实际的能效变化规律。

Method: 提出了一种基于Transformer计算和内存访问复杂度的解析模型，用于准确描述能效与输入输出长度关系的非线性依赖性，并使用TensorRT-LLM在NVIDIA H100 GPU上对多种LLMs（1B-9B参数）在不同序列长度（64-4096 tokens）下进行了能耗评估。

Result: 在多种LLM和序列长度的测试中，提出的模型实现了1.79%的平均MAPE，准确刻画了LLM推理的能效曲线。证明了存在一个能效“最优区域”，即在中等长度输入和中等长度输出下能效最高，长输入或极短输出会导致能效显著下降。

Conclusion: 通过调整序列长度以匹配能效“最优区域”，可以大幅减少LLM推理的能耗，从而支持生产系统中采用智能截断、摘要生成和自适应生成策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

TL;DR: GenLoRA通过使用径向基函数（RBF）生成低秩矩阵的基向量，而不是显式存储它们，从而提高了LoRA的参数效率，在更小的参数预算下实现了更高的有效秩和更好的微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的LoRA在增加模型容量时需要增加基向量，导致参数量显著增长。本研究旨在解决LoRA参数冗余问题，提高参数效率。

Method: GenLoRA用轻量级非线性函数（径向基函数RBF）替换了显式存储的基向量。它为每个低秩矩阵维护一个潜在向量，并使用一组RBF来合成基向量，从而大大减少了参数量。

Result: GenLoRA在多个数据集和架构上进行了广泛实验，结果表明，在更小的参数预算下，GenLoRA能够获得更高的有效LoRA秩，并在微调性能上优于标准LoRA。

Conclusion: GenLoRA通过非线性生成基向量，显著提高了LoRA的参数效率，实现了更好的微调性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）方法将自身视为一种树剪枝机制，但存在一种被称为递归空间收缩（RSC）的系统性病变。RSC 是由正锐化和负压缩的组合动力学驱动的不可逆转的崩溃，导致有效替代方案的采样概率消失。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为锚定策略优化（APO）的新方法，它将范式从全局形状匹配转移到支持覆盖。APO 通过定义一个基于参考模型高置信度支持的安全流形，允许进行积极的锐化以提高效率，并在纠错过程中调用恢复力以防止崩溃。

Result: 理论上，APO 被证明是一种梯度对齐机制，用于最大化支持覆盖，从而实现弹性恢复，重新膨胀有效的分支。在数学基准上的实证评估表明，APO 打破了准确性-多样性之间的权衡，显著提高了 Pass@1 的准确率，同时恢复了标准策略梯度方法通常会丢失的 Pass@K 多样性。

Conclusion: APO 是一种新的范式，通过关注支持覆盖而非全局形状匹配，解决了 RLVR 中的 RSC 问题。它通过允许积极锐化和选择性恢复力来实现这一点，从而在不牺牲准确性的情况下提高多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的RLFKV框架能够有效地提高金融RAG系统生成回应的忠实度，减少幻觉，并与检索到的文档保持一致。

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker通过自主规划和自适应检索，结合SFT和RL的双重训练策略，能够有效地解决时间图谱问题回答中的推理幻觉和泛化能力问题，并在复杂场景下取得优异表现。

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

*Shengpu Wang,Yuhao Mao,Yani Zhang,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Boolean neural networks offer a resource-efficient alternative to floating-point networks, but learning them is difficult. This paper proposes three novel techniques—learned connections, compact convolutions, and adaptive discretization—to address this challenge. The proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and computational cost on vision benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point neural networks are computationally expensive for inference, driving interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained environments. However, learning accurate and compact Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature.

Method: The paper introduces three novel strategies: 1) learned connections that do not require additional parameters or significant computational overhead, 2) a compact convolutional Boolean architecture that leverages locality and reduces Boolean operations compared to existing methods, and 3) an adaptive discretization strategy to minimize accuracy loss during the conversion of continuous-valued networks to Boolean ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard vision benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves a superior Pareto front of accuracy versus computation compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. It offers improved accuracy with a substantial reduction in Boolean operations (up to 37x fewer).

Conclusion: The proposed approach, combining learned connections, compact convolutions, and adaptive discretization, effectively addresses the challenges of learning accurate and efficient Boolean neural networks, leading to significant improvements in both accuracy and computational cost for vision tasks.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

Abstract: While humans perceive the world through diverse modalities that operate synergistically to support a holistic understanding of their surroundings, existing omnivideo models still face substantial challenges on audio-visual understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning. OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities from basic dialogue to advanced scientific reasoning. However, existing benchmarks in biology often fail to assess a critical skill required of researchers: the ability to integrate experimental results with contextual knowledge to derive meaningful conclusions. To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.

*Anton Ipsen,Michael Cashmore,Kirsty Fielding,Nicolas Marchesotti,Parisa Zehtabi,Daniele Magazzeni,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We propose a new framework to solve the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP), which optimizes team seating in large organizations by ensuring hierarchical proximity. Our approach combines PRM/RRT for distance calculation with heuristic search and dynamic programming for allocation, outperforming manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The HSAP is driven by the need for large organizations with complex hierarchies to seat closely related teams near each other, a task currently done manually and inefficiently.

Method: We developed a framework that uses a Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) to calculate distances between seats, combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming to solve the HSAP via integer programming.

Result: Our approach was tested on various instance sizes, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements over manual seating arrangements.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework effectively addresses the HSAP, offering a scalable and improved solution compared to current manual processes.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: AgentHeLLM框架通过形式化分离资产和攻击路径，弥补了现有AI安全框架的不足，为应对LLM智能助手在车辆中的安全挑战提供了一种系统性的方法。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在建模与仿真（M&S）领域日益普及，但需要注意其使用中的潜在陷阱，例如数据量过大、微调不当或超参数设置不合理。本文旨在为LLM在M&S中的应用提供实用指南，重点关注非确定性、知识增强（如RAG和LoRA）、数据分解和超参数调优等常见问题，强调原则性设计、诊断策略和实证评估，以帮助建模者做出明智决策。

Result: 指出了LLM使用的潜在问题，如添加更多数据可能适得其反、微调可能不必要、温度设置为0并不足以使LLM确定性、提供大量M&S数据可能过多、以及简单的简化可能丢失信息。

Conclusion: 强调了在M&S应用中，模型设计者需要做出明智的决策，考虑LLM的适用性、使用方法以及潜在风险，并通过原则性设计、诊断策略和实证评估来优化LLM的使用效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典强化学习模型在解决载货车辆路径问题（CVRP）等复杂的组合优化问题方面展现出巨大潜力，其性能超越了纯经典方法，并能生成更优的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化和足够大的数据集，语音情感识别（SER）研究受到限制。本研究旨在探索预训练的ASR系统Whisper在SER任务中的应用潜力，并提出新的方法来提取有效的情感特征。

Method: 提出并评估了两种基于注意力机制的池化方法：多头注意力平均池化和QKV池化，用于从Whisper模型的表示中提取情感特征并降低维度。在IEMOCAP（英语）和ShEMO（波斯语）数据集上使用Whisper Tiny和Small模型进行了实验，并分析了不同Whisper编码器层的性能。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing new interventions in VR for school security is difficult due to the need for new participant cohorts for each condition, hindering large-scale or iterative evaluation, especially for learning effective intervention strategies.

Method: Developed a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. Used the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy.

Result: The DES successfully reproduces key empirical patterns from VR studies and enables scalable evaluation of intervention strategies infeasible to train directly with human subjects.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DyTopo是一个管理节点引导的多智能体框架，通过在每一轮重建稀疏的有向通信图来优化多轮推理。它基于管理节点的轮次目标，让每个智能体输出查询（需求）和提供（提供）描述符，然后嵌入这些描述符并进行语义匹配，仅沿诱导边进行消息传递。DyTopo在代码生成和数学推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并提供可解释的协调轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的大语言模型的多智能体系统虽然能改进多轮推理，但其通信模式固定，不适用于迭代问题解决中不同阶段的需求。需要一个能根据问题解决的不同阶段动态调整通信方式的框架。

Method: DyTopo框架在每一轮中，由管理节点根据其轮次目标，指导每个智能体生成自然语言的查询（need）和提供（offer）描述符。然后，将这些描述符嵌入并进行语义匹配，仅沿着由此产生的连接边进行私有消息传递，从而动态构建稀疏有向通信图。

Result: DyTopo在代码生成和数学推理基准测试以及四种大语言模型上，均持续优于最强的基线模型，平均提升了6.2%。此外，DyTopo通过不断演变的通信图提供了可解释的协调轨迹，便于对通信路径如何随轮次变化进行定性检查。

Conclusion: DyTopo通过动态重构通信图，克服了现有固定通信模式的局限性，有效提升了多智能体系统的多轮推理能力，并提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.
