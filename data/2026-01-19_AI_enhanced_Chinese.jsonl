The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684 entropy \u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u535a\u5f08\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4ee5 Tic-Tac-Toe \u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6b21\u4f18\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0centropy-aware \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece baseline \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7ed3\u679c-11.6% \u63d0\u5347\u5230 +9.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u5c40\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff1b\u4e14 token-level entropy \u4e0e\u8d70\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\uff1a\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684 CoT \u63a8\u7406\u591a\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u7ebf\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e entropy \u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84 CoT\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u68c0\u7d22\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06 in-context learning \u4e0e entropy-guided CoT \u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 token-level entropy \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u68c0\u7d22\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f83\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u591a\u8def\u5f84 CoT \u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u5728 Tic-Tac-Toe \u5bf9\u6297\u6b21\u4f18\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u4e3a 100 \u5c40\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u535a\u5f08\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u80dc+1\u3001\u5e730\u3001\u8d1f-1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8d70\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e entropy \u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf LLM \u7684 -11.6% \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7ed3\u679c\uff0centropy-guided \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5c06\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u81f3 +9.5%\uff1b\u5728\u6bcf\u5c40\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684 LLM \u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0ctoken-level entropy \u4e0e\u8d70\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0centropy-guided CoT \u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6e38\u620f\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .", "code_url": "https://github.com/microsoft/byol", "AI": {"tldr": "BYOL provides a tiered, language-aware LLM development framework to expand multilingual capabilities by aligning training with each language's digital footprint; achieves ~12% improvement for Chichewa/Maori and +4 BLEU for Inuktitut via translation-mediated inclusion; releases resources and code.", "motivation": "Global language resource imbalance severely limits LLM performance for low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages.

In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media.

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case.

However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used.

However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.\n  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text.

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Deep GraphRAG\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22+\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c beam-search \u52a8\u6001\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728 1.5B \u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7 DW-GRPO \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1 70B \u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728 Natural Questions \u548c HotpotQA \u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 GraphRAG \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c42\u7ea7\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c42\u7ea7\u56fe\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u5168\u5c40\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a (1) inter-community filtering\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u88c1\u526a\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b(2) community-level refinement\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b(3) entity-level \u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u793e\u533a\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e beam search \u7684\u52a8\u6001\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684 LLM\uff081.5B\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO) \u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Natural Questions \u548c HotpotQA \u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Deep GraphRAG \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e beam \u641c\u7d22\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387-\u5168\u5c40\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c42\u6b21\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CTHA\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c42\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7c7b\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6d88\u606f\u5951\u7ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4ef2\u88c1\u5206\u8fa8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ef2\u88c1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1a\u5931\u8d25\u7ea7\u8fde\u51cf\u5c1147%\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53472.3\u500d\u3001\u76f8\u8f83\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CTHA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post).

Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality.

In particular, we focus on a widely adopted class of collaborative autoencoders (CFAEs) and augment them by inserting an SAE between their encoder and decoder networks.

This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements.

Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design.

As these two media increasingly converge in everyday information-seeking behavior, it is essential to explore how their interaction influences user attitudes, particularly in contexts involving controversial, value-laden, and often debated topics. Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions. A majority of users in our study corresponded to attitude change outcomes, and we found an effect of sequence on attitude change.

A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAction Shapley\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4eShapley\u7684\u6307\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0>80%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eAction Shapley\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u610f\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf/\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u660e\u663e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e0\u504f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAction Shapley\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u539f\u672c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc780%\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eAction Shapley\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6216\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff08ad-hoc\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Action Shapley\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines.

To address this issue, we conduct a comprehensive literature review with a particular focus on methods for the validation of simulated user queries with regard to real queries. Based on the review, we develop a taxonomy that structures the current landscape of available measures.

Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain.

FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time.

However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve.

Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline.

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SGD\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u89e3\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cSGD\u566a\u58f0\u5c06\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u5851\u4e3a\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u52bf\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u80fd\u91cf\u969c\u788d\u589e\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u8c37\u8dc3\u51bb\u7ed3\u5e76\u9501\u5b9a\u5728\u5355\u8c37\u3002\u589e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55SGD\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790SGD\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u628a\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u8c37\u8dc3\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u77ac\u6001\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cSGD\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u65ad\u9003\u79bb\u5c16\u9510\u8c37\u533a\u5e76\u5411\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b\u566a\u58f0\u91cd\u5851\u635f\u5931\u5730\u5f62\u4e3a\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u52bf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u671f\u80fd\u91cf\u969c\u788d\u63d0\u5347\u6291\u5236\u8c37\u95f4\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ec5\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a Basin \u5185\u505c\u7559\uff1b\u589e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u63a8\u8fdf\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6 MGF-RL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u6545\u969c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94 unseen \u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bfc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728 IEEE 13/123-bus \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6 RL\u3001MAML-RL \u4e0e MPC\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\u6062\u590d\u5173\u952e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f7f\u6062\u590d\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u89c4 RL \u6613\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u65b0\u6545\u969c\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u53d1\u7535\u6a21\u5f0f\u5927\u91cf\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MGF-RL\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u9636\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2 outage \u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u5728\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728 IEEE 13-bus \u4e0e IEEE 123-bus \u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cMGF-RL \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6 RL\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e MAML \u7684\u5143 RL \u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u672a\u89c1 outage \u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u56de\u5408\u6570\u663e\u8457\u5c11\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf RL\u3002\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u4e3a\u5728\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "conclusion": "MGF-RL \u4e3a\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u754c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation.

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance.

Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process.

This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions.

This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5728 Spurious-Motif \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u542b\u5f3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u5173\u7684 Spurious-Motif \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u865a\u5047\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u771f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8fa8\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u501f\u9274\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u601d\u8def\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff1a\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8282\u70b9/\u8fb9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u56de\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8f6e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8fed\u4ee3\u56de\u8def\uff1b\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u6709\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u805a\u7126\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u5728 Spurious-Motif \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff08\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u56fe\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Submitted to Journal of Combinatorial Optimization. Special Issue: Recent applications, models and algorithms in Combinatorial Optimization", "summary": "The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.\n  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.\n  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684probe-and-solve\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165 CPMpy\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728ACE\u4e0eChoco\u4e0a\u5bf9114\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "Constraint programming\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6781\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u53c2\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u96c6\uff1b\u6c42\u89e3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9ACE\u548cChoco\u8fdb\u884c114\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\uff0cACE\u572825.4%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c57.9%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1bChoco\u4e0a\u572838.6%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "probe-and-solve\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684CP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces.

In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly.

In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees.

A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines.

To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals.

Code available at https://github.com/sakura20221/RT-RAG", "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "RT-RAG \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a SOTA\uff08F1 \u63d0\u5347\u7ea67.0%\uff0cEM \u63d0\u5347\u7ea66.0%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56 LLM \u81ea\u6211\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5404\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RT-RAG \u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5c06\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5171\u8bc6\u6027\u6811\u9009\u62e9\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u5df2\u77e5\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5b9e\u4f53\u5206\u79bb\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u904d\u5386\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e refined\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bc1\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cRT-RAG \u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1 \u63d0\u5347\u7ea67.0%\uff0cEM \u63d0\u5347\u7ea66.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0cRT-RAG \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact.

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance.

Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization.

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks.

Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties.

Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete.

While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities.

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: \"Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?\", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\u0394\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences.

Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa FAQ\uff08Family-Aware Quantization\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65cf\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6807\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347 PTQ \u7684\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728 Qwen3-8B \u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u9ad8 28.5% \u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "PTQ \u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u6807\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6807\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u65cf\u4e2d\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e00\u578bLLM\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6807\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b Chain-of-Thought \u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3) \u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\u7ade\u4e89\u4ee5\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u65b0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347 PTQ \u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec Qwen3-8B\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFAQ \u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u6807\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u591a 28.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u540c\u65cf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684 calibration \u6570\u636e\u518d\u751f\u6210\u4e3a PTQ \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 \"disagreement\" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection.

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA) \u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684 LoRA \u9002\u914d\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u805a\u5408\uff09\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50/\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u79c1\u6709\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728 GLUE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7528/\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u8d28\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4e\u79e9\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u805a\u5408 LoRA \u66f4\u65b0\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5f3a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u79e9\u6216\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684 adapter \u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u79c1\u6709\uff0c\u4e0d\u53c2\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u3002\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5757\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728 GLUE \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSDFLoRA \u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u8054\u90a6 LoRA \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "SDFLoRA \u80fd\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u79e9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u5177\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRM \u751f\u6210\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c LRMs \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53ca RLHF \u6709\u5173\uff1b\u6587\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u9010\u53e5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\u83b7\u5f97\u65b0\u6d1e\u89c1\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05 CoT \u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53cd\u6620\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a AI \u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u4e00\u4e2a LRM \u751f\u6210 CoT \u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u7ed9\u5176\u4ed6 LRMs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u548c RLHF \u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u54ea\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9010\u53e5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "CoT \u89e3\u91ca\u5f80\u5f80\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u548c RLHF \u7684\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9010\u53e5\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5229\u7528 LRM \u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u65b0\u6d1e\u89c1\u65f6\u9700\u4fdd\u6301\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u523b\u753b LRM \u89e3\u91ca\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPREAD: \u5728 RAG \u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 DLM \u7684\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u56de\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff08RSD\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 DLM \u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff08RSD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728 DLM \u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SPREAD\uff08Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f93\u51fa\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u5728 RAG \u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSPREAD \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e RSD \u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "SPREAD \u4e3a DLM \u5728 RAG \u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb DLM \u4e0e RAG \u7684\u66f4\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CPU\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5e76\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebfRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u65e0\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebfRL\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4efb\u610f\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7070\u76d2\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u5e94\u7528\u7aef\u5fc3\u8df3\u7b49\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\uff1b\u5728Intel Running Average Power Limit\uff08RAPL\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u8017\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u73b0\u573a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684RAPL\u529f\u8017\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CPU\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u786c\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies.

The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $j\u03ba$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $j\u03ba$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGNs\u548cLUTNs\u5728MIT-BIH\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad894.28%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0ej\u03ba=0.683\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff082.89k\u20136.17k FLOPs\uff09\u4e0e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08Artix-7 FPGA\uff0c2000\u20132990 LUTs\uff0c5\u20137 mW\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eMUX\u5e03\u5c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684LUT\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u7387\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5bf9MIT-BIH\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u690d\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u529f\u8017\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684ECG\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u548c\u690d\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs)\u4e0eLookup Table Networks (LUTNs)\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u60a3\u8005\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMUX\u5e03\u5c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684LUT\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5728LGN/LUTN\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7387\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u5728MIT-BIH\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Artix-7 FPGA\u4e0a\u4f30\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u529f\u8017\uff082k\u20133k LUTs\u30015\u20137 mW\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad894.28%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cj\u03ba=0.683\uff1bFLOPs\u4ec52.89k\u20136.17k\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8eSOTA\uff1bFPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u97002000\u20132990 LUTs\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u529f\u801750\u201370 pJ/\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u7ea65\u20137 mW\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80LGN\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LGN\u4e0eLUTN\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u53ef\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u810f\u690d\u5165\u6216\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6ECG\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u672a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684MetaboNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3T1D\u7ba1\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6c47\u96c6CGM\u4e0e\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u6cf5\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5f00\u4e0eDUA\u53d7\u9650\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dT1D\u7ba1\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u83b7\u53d6\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6c47\u96c6\u591a\u4efd\u516c\u5f00T1D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aMetaboNet\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u9700\u5305\u542bCGM\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u7ed9\u836f\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u82e5\u53ef\u5f97\u8fd8\u4fdd\u7559\u7cd6\u6444\u5165\u548c\u4f53\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u516c\u5f00\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u53caDUA\u9650\u5236\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u9644\u5e26\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "MetaboNet\u5305\u542b3135\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u30011228\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5e74\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u5927\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u516c\u5f00\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0b\u8f7d\uff0cDUA\u5b50\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u7533\u8bf7\u8bbf\u95ee\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8840\u7cd6\u8c31\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u7684T1D\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8de8\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models", "comment": "Accepted at TMLR. Code: https://github.com/rarazafin/score_diffusion_ensemble", "summary": "Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982FID\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08Deep Ensembles\u3001MC Dropout\uff09\u8986\u76d6CIFAR-10\u4e0eFFHQ\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u627e\u5230\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c06\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982FID\uff09\uff0c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Deep Ensembles\u3001Monte Carlo Dropout \u7b49\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5728 CIFAR-10 \u4e0e FFHQ \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u3001\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982 FID\u3001IS \u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u96c6\u6210\u786e\u5b9e\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9 FID \u7b49\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u603b\u4f53\u8d8b\u52bf\u662f\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e76\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u542f\u793a\u53ca\u5bf9\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u53d7\u76ca\u800c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u672a\u5fc5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5bfc/ guidance\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRKV \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u79e9 KV \u9002\u914d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u5934\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e KV \u7f13\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0cKV \u7f13\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5934\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5934\u90e8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6bcf\u5c42\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5168\u79e9 KV \u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5404\u5934\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9879\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5934\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6298\u4e2d\u3002LRKV \u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u6362\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u67e5\u8be2/\u5206\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u7b49\u67e5\u8be2\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 MLA\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cLRKV \u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001MQA/GQA \u548c MLA \u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5728 25 \u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0cLRKV \u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684 KV \u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef FLOPs \u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0 20\u201325% \u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cLRKV \u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5168\u90e8\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684 KV \u5171\u4eab\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5934\u7684\u5206\u5316\u6765\u8865\u507f\u3002", "conclusion": "LRKV \u4e3a\u5728\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55 Transformer \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u9009\u9879\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
