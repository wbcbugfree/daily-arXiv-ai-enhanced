SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including\n2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across\nfour complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language\ndescriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables\nresearch on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,\nand automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports\nbroader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software\nmining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for\nscalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM\narchitectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level\nhuman semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent\nsystems that reason about code.

Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training\nsetups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which\ndirection - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what\nwe measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation\nframework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary\ndimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive\nUncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the\nnotion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across\nmodel and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing\ndecision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes."}

While\nreinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing \"Aha\"\nmoments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for\nlong-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data\nare scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for\nadvanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis\napproach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context\ntasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large\ncollections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to\ntrace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve\nrelevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on\nKeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning\npattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K\neffectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.\nOn Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA\naccuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

For an\nunderlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we\nprove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically\nestablish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the\nnetwork, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through\nextensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior\nperformance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the\nimproved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated."}

However, we\nfind that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is\nredistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically\nrelated rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,\nwhich explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem\nfurther obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport\nactual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that\nexplicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence\ngenerations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture\nthe very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,\nincorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the\nsqueezing effect.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations.

Existing approaches to high-dimensional\ninference for projection parameters, such as~\\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on\ninverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \\gtrsim\nd^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,\nrendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable\ndimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates\nwhen the number of iterations grows as $t \\gtrsim d^{1+\\delta}$ for any $\\delta\n> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works\nwhile improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based\nprocedure operates in $\\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\\mathcal{O}(d)$\nmemory, in contrast to the $\\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of\ncovariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we\nfurther develop an \\emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance\nappearing in the CLT and establish \\emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for\nthis estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and\ndata-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in\nthe near-optimal scaling regime $t \\gtrsim d^{1+\\delta}$."}

To\nensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each\nmodel's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks\nrequiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical\ndiagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our\nmethodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact\ntest suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets\ndistinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content\nconstraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate\nmodels from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and\nemerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing\ncomparative performance analysis.

To overcome this, we introduce\nScaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive\ntraining framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a\nmodel's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses\nlearning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,\nranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to\nconstruct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging\nmathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the\npass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative\n44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework\nprovides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to\nsolve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending\nthe frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM."}

Hubble models come in standard\nand perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English\ncorpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled\ninsertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to\nemulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard\nand perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B\ntokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency\nof sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password\nappearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password\nin a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text\ninserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without\ncontinued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices\nfor addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the\nsize of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in\ntraining. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range\nof memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how\nreadily different types of private information are memorized. We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work."}
