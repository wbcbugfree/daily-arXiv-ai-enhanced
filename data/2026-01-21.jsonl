In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. The codes are provided at https://github.com/KingGugu/TADA."}

In such scenarios, retrieval models that can capture user-specified nuances in query intent and adapt results accordingly are desirable -- instruction-following retrieval models promise such a capability. In this work, we evaluate instructed retrievers for the prevalent yet under-explored application of aspect-conditional seed-guided exploration using an expert-annotated test collection. We evaluate both recent LLMs fine-tuned for instructed retrieval and general-purpose LLMs prompted for ranking with the highly performant Pairwise Ranking Prompting. We find that the best instructed retrievers improve on ranking relevance compared to instruction-agnostic approaches. However, we also find that instruction following performance, crucial to the user experience of interacting with models, does not mirror ranking relevance improvements and displays insensitivity or counter-intuitive behavior to instructions. Our results indicate that while users may benefit from using current instructed retrievers over instruction-agnostic models, they may not benefit from using them for long-running exploratory sessions requiring greater sensitivity to instructions."}

However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used. Extensive experiments across various multi-hop QA benchmarks show that PruneRAG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines."}

Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game.

This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods.

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning.

While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol ."}

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework."}

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency."}

Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style.

Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones.

Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds."}

Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods."}

In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular \"Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM\" architectures."}

SAEs can uncover high-quality, interpretable features at different levels of granularity and enable targeted steering of the generation process by selectively activating specific neurons in their latent activations. Our paper is the first to apply this approach to collaborative filtering, aiming to extract similarly interpretable features from representations learned purely from interaction signals. In particular, we focus on a widely adopted class of collaborative autoencoders (CFAEs) and augment them by inserting an SAE between their encoder and decoder networks. We demonstrate that such representation is largely monosemantic and propose suitable mapping functions between semantic concepts and individual neurons. We also evaluate a simple yet effective method that utilizes this representation to steer the recommendations in a desired direction."}

However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems."}

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems."}

It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

While effective, these methods risk hallucinations and misalignment with collection-specific terminology. We propose a hybrid alternative that preserves the robustness and interpretability of classical PRF while leveraging LLM semantic judgement. Our method inserts an LLM-based filtering stage prior to RM3 estimation: the LLM judges the documents in the initial top-$k$ ranking, and RM3 is computed only over those accepted as relevant.

We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify (\"Is this statement correct?\") versus attributed to a speaker (\"Is this speaker correct?\"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization."}

This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks."}

Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$."}

Moreover, most approaches do not account for preference differences across generators, resulting in unstable cross-generator performance. We propose \\textbf{Rank4Gen}, a generator-aware ranker for RAG that targets the goal of \\emph{Ranking for Generators}. Rank4Gen introduces two key preference modeling strategies: (1) \\textbf{From Ranking Relevance to Response Quality}, which optimizes ranking with respect to downstream response quality rather than query--document relevance; and (2) \\textbf{Generator-Specific Preference Modeling}, which conditions a single ranker on different generators to capture their distinct ranking preferences. To enable such modeling, we construct \\textbf{PRISM}, a dataset built from multiple open-source corpora and diverse downstream generators.

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO."}

To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions.

Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination.

We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM."}

Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations.

This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods.

In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement."}

The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation."}

We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems."}

The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search."}

To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices."}

We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines.

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records.

These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\\% across forecasting horizons.

However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy.

Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain.

Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds."}

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms."}

However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family.

After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \\textbf{SCALE}, which means \\underline{\\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \\underline{\\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \\underline{\\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\\%."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids."}

However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements."}

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools."}

Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models."}

We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions.

The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods"}

Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely."}

Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits."}

Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks."}

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism."}

To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions.

In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results."}

Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal.

Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework."}

Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\\% in F1 and 39.14\\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models."}

In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular \"Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM\" architectures."}

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines."}

In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement."}

We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks.

Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability."}

However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications."}

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism."}

Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."}

These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits."}

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement."}

While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics.

Yet, it is still uncertain how LLMs assign importance to each attribute and whether such assignments are in line with economic principles, recruiter preferences or broader societal norms. We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics.

We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: \"Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?\", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs."}

We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability."}

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency."}

Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones.

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency.

In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed."}

A Brief Empirical Analysis of Tokenizers", "comment": null, "summary": "Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs."}

In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector."}

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework."}

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost."}

We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions.

Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies.

We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: \"Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?\", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\\cos$.

Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%."}

Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut.

Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes.

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools."}

Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points.

This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records.

The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework."}

This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning.

In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality.

Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches."}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets."}

We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architectures that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant distribution shifts, including multi-turn conversations, long context prompts, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while our novel architectures address context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible."}

The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts."}

Xinyue Ma and Heelim Hong contributed equally (co-first authors)", "summary": "Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods."}

The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments."}

Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds."}

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency."}

We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined."}

For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA."}
