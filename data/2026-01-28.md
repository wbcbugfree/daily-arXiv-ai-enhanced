### [1] [Language Family Matters: Evaluating LLM-Based ASR Across Linguistic Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18899)
*Yuchen Zhang,Ravi Shekhar,Haralambos Mouratidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于语言家族的连接器共享策略，在LLM驱动的多语言ASR中实现每个家族一个连接器，以减少参数量并提升跨领域泛化能力；在两种多语言LLM和两份真实世界语料上进行验证，显示优于逐语言连接器的性能与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作为每种语言训练单独的连接器，未利用语言间的相关性，导致参数冗余且跨域泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出基于语言家族的连接器共享策略，即按语言家族分配一个连接器，并在两种多语言LLM及两种真实语料（ curated 与 crowd-sourced ）上进行实证评估，比较参数量与跨域泛化表现。

Result: 家族级连接器显著降低参数量，同时提升跨领域泛化能力，在两种LLM和两类语料上均表现稳健。

Conclusion: 基于语言家族的连接器策略为多语言ASR的部署提供了更具实用性和可扩展性的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems achieve strong performance with limited resources by linking a frozen speech encoder to a pretrained LLM via a lightweight connector. Prior work trains a separate connector per language, overlooking linguistic relatedness. We propose an efficient and novel connector-sharing strategy based on linguistic family membership, enabling one connector per family, and empirically validate its effectiveness across two multilingual LLMs and two real-world corpora spanning curated and crowd-sourced speech. Our results show that family-based connectors reduce parameter count while improving generalization across domains, offering a practical and scalable strategy for multilingual ASR deployment.

### [2] [Self-Aware Knowledge Probing: Evaluating Language Models' Relational Knowledge through Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18901)
*Christopher Kissling,Elena Merdjanovska,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个关系知识的校准探测框架，揭示当前语言模型在关系知识方面普遍过度自信，且对语句改写的一致性校正能显著提升校准效果；但即便是参数规模最大的模型，在理解语言中“信心表达”的语义方面仍存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识探查主要关注预测准确性等指标，未充分评估模型对其输出的置信度的可靠性。本研究提出将置信度校准纳入知识探查，以更全面评估模型的可靠性与推理能力。

Method: 提出三模态的关系知识校准探测框架：1) 内在置信度；2) 结构一致性；3) 语义支撑。对十个因果LM和六个掩码化LM进行大规模分析，比较不同训练目标对置信度校准的影响，并考察对改写语句引发不一致性的鲁棒性，以及语言性置信表达的语义理解。

Result: 大多数模型，尤其是使用掩码化目标预训练的模型，表现出过度自信的倾向。最好的校准来自能够考虑改写导致的不一致性的置信度估计方法。此外，即使是最大的预训练模型，也难以准确编码“信心表达”的语义。

Conclusion: 在关系知识探测中纳入置信度校准有助于更真实地衡量模型的知识与推理能力；通过考虑改写不一致性的方法可获得更好的校准结果；但对语言置信表达的语义理解仍是一个挑战，需进一步研究语义层面的 grounding。

Abstract: Knowledge probing quantifies how much relational knowledge a language model (LM) has acquired during pre-training. Existing knowledge probes evaluate model capabilities through metrics like prediction accuracy and precision. Such evaluations fail to account for the model's reliability, reflected in the calibration of its confidence scores. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration probing framework for relational knowledge, covering three modalities of model confidence: (1) intrinsic confidence, (2) structural consistency and (3) semantic grounding. Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing. Moreover, even the largest pre-trained models fail to encode the semantics of linguistic confidence expressions accurately.

### [3] [Flatter Tokens are More Valuable for Speculative Draft Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18902)
*Jiaming Fan,Daming Cao,Xiangzhong Luo,Jiale Fu,Chonghan Liu,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过平滑性指标筛选训练样本以实现数据蒸馏，提升Speculative Decoding的训练与推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SD通常需要在大规模数据上训练草案模型，但并非所有样本对SD接受率贡献相同。理论与经验表明，令目标模型预测分布更平坦的token更具价值。

Method: 提出Sample-level-flatness（样本水平平滑度）指标，基于该平滑性筛选数据，构建Flatness-based Dataset Distillation（SFDD），以保留对SD最有价值的样本。对EAGLE框架进行实验验证。

Result: 在仅使用50%数据的条件下，实现超过2倍的训练加速；且最终推理速度提升与全数据集基线相比仅差约4%。论文同时给出代码实现链接。

Conclusion: 提出的数据中心化策略显著提升SD训练效率，为快速推理加速提供可行路径，具备良好的可复现性。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a key technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference, but it typically requires training a draft model on a large dataset. We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline. This work introduces an effective, data-centric approach that substantially improves the training efficiency for Speculative Decoding.

### [4] [BabyReasoningBench: Generating Developmentally-Inspired Reasoning Tasks for Evaluating Baby Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18933)
*Kaustubh D. Dhole*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 BabyReasoningBench，一份由 GPT-5.2 生成的包含 19 道经典发展心理学范式的推理基准；对两种以儿童语言为训练分布的 GPT-2 baby 模型进行评估，发现总体表现低且不均衡，规模化提升部分因果与物理推理任务，但信念归因与语用敏感任务仍具挑战；该基准用于分析在儿童式输入下哪些推理能力可能出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成人中心的推理基准以广泛世界知识和复杂指令遵循为前提，未能覆盖以儿童语言输入为分布的模型的推理能力，因而难以揭示在发展性语言环境中可能涌现的能力。建立以发展性语言输入为约束的基准，有助于界定哪些推理能力在早期学习阶段就能出现，并检验相关机制假设。

Method: 设计并实现 19 个推理任务，涵盖心智理论、类比与关系推理、因果推断与干预选择，以及受记忆与语用显著影响的核心推理原理；基于 GPT-5.2 生成基准文本及题组；在两种以儿童指向性语料训练的 GPT-2 演化模型上评估，分析任务族群间的表现差异与规模效应。

Result: 两种基于儿童语言分布的 GPT-2 模型总体表现较低但呈现不均匀差异；扩展规模提升了若干因果和物理推理任务的性能，而信念归因与语用敏感任务仍然具挑战性。

Conclusion: BabyReasoningBench 提供一个发展性视角，帮助分析在儿童样本分布下哪些推理能力可能出现，并用于检验关于这些能力如何通过学习涌现的机制性假设。

Abstract: Traditional evaluations of reasoning capabilities of language models are dominated by adult-centric benchmarks that presuppose broad world knowledge, complex instruction following, and mature pragmatic competence. These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.

### [5] [LLMs versus the Halting Problem: Revisiting Program Termination Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18987)
*Oren Sultan,Jordi Armengol-Estape,Pascal Kesseli,Julien Vanegue,Dafna Shahaf,Yossi Adi,Peter O'Hearn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can predict termination for SV-Comp 2025 C programs with high accuracy and near-top performance under test-time-scaling, but struggle to produce valid proof witnesses and their accuracy degrades with longer programs; indicates potential but requires reliability improvements and integration with formal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在可判定性问题上的推理能力，评估其在实际验证基准上的终止预测表现，以及与传统工具的对比，探讨潜在应用与局限。

Method: 在SV-Comp 2025的Termination类别中，使用多种LLMs（如GPT-5、Claude Sonnet-4.5、Code World Model）对多样化的C程序进行终止预测，并与顶级工具在测试时刻尺度下的表现比较；分析LLMs给出证明的有效性、以及程序长度对性能的影响。

Result: LLMs在预测终止方面表现出色，GPT-5和Claude Sonnet-4.5的表现接近在测试时尺度下的顶级工具，CWM紧随第二名工具之后；但LLMs通常无法提供有效的证明证据作为 Witness；当程序长度增加时，LLMs的性能下降。

Conclusion: LLMs对不可判定问题的推理显示潜力，能在终止预测上与传统工具形成竞争，但在证明可验证性与规模扩展方面尚待改进，需进一步研究以实现可靠性和可验证的证据生成。

Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.

### [6] [Malicious Repurposing of Open Science Artefacts by Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18998)
*Zahra Hashemi,Zhiqiang Zhong,Jun Pang,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can be repurposed to generate harmful research proposals by exploiting open artefacts, even when artefacts are ethically designed, and LLMs are inconsistent as evaluators across models, necessitating human judgment for credible dual-use risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual-use risk of autonomous LLMs in science: whether they can hijack open-science artefacts to produce harmful research and whether current LLM evaluators provide reliable risk assessments.

Method: Develop an end-to-end pipeline: (1) jailbreak LLM safeguards via persuasion-based techniques, (2) reinterpret NLP papers to identify artefacts (datasets, methods, tools) that could be repurposed, and (3) assess proposals with an evaluation framework across harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality.

Result: LLMs are capable of generating harmful proposals by repurposing ethical artefacts; however, there is strong disagreement among LLM evaluators (GPT-4.1 more permissive, Gemini-2.5-pro stricter, Grok-3 intermediate), indicating unreliable automatic judgment and the need for human evaluation for credible risk assessment.

Conclusion: Current LLMs cannot reliably judge dual-use risk; human-in-the-loop evaluation is essential for credible safety assessments of LLM-generated research proposals and misuse scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has fuelled enthusiasm about their role in advancing scientific discovery, with studies exploring LLMs that autonomously generate and evaluate novel research ideas. However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment.

### [7] [FROST: Filtering Reasoning Outliers with Attention for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19001)
*Haozheng Luo,Zhuolin Jiang,Md Zahid Hasan,Yan Chen,Soumalya Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FROST是一种利用注意力权重来 pruning 未关键的推理路径的注意力感知方法，提出推理离群点的概念并通过注意力机制移除它们。理论上在不损失推理能力的前提下消除句子级离群点；在四个基准上用两种强推理模型（Phi-4-Reasoning 与 GPT-OSS-20B）验证，优于 TALE、ThinkLess 等方法，平均减少69.68%的token使用、准确率提升26.70%，并显著降低注意力离群指标的最大无穷范数和平均峰度。代码公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型推理的效率与可靠性，通过对注意力权重进行筛选来删除不关键的推理步骤，从而减少推理路径长度、降低计算成本，并解决推理过程中的离群点问题。

Method: 引入推理离群点的概念，设计基于注意力的机制在句子层面筛除离群推理，进而剪裁推理轨迹；理论分析表明在不损失甚至提升模型推理容量的前提下消除离群点；在四个基准上使用Phi-4-Reasoning和GPT-OSS-20B进行评估。

Result: 在四个基准上，FROST相比基线实现平均69.68%的token使用减少和26.70%的准确性提升；注意力离群度量（最大无穷范数、平均峰度）分别降低了15.97%和91.09%。与TALE、ThinkLess等方法相比具有更强的性能。代码在GitHub公开。

Conclusion: FROST通过注意力驱动的推理离群点移除在保持甚至提升推理能力的同时显著提升推理效率，提供了一个可实用、可复现的推理优化框架，并给出可公开的实现。

Abstract: We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level. Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness. These results highlight the importance of holistic, multi-reward alignment for practical conversational SDS.

### [9] [PsyProbe: Proactive and Interpretable Dialogue through User State Modeling for Exploratory Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19096)
*Sohhyung Park,Hyunji Kang,Sungzoon Cho,Dongil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsyProbe 是一个面向咨询探索阶段的主动对话系统，通过 PPPPPI 框架对用户心理状态进行系统建模，并结合多模块实现前置式提问与策略性对话，在真实场景中对比基线模型表现优异，提升参与意图与自然感，并提升核心问题理解与提问效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型多为被动式对话，缺乏系统化的用户状态建模以支持主动、探询式治疗。需构建一个能够在咨询早期阶段主动探索并追踪心理状态的对话系统。

Method: 提出 PPPPPI 框架（ Presenting/ Predisposing/ Precipitating/ Perpetuating/ Protective/ Impact）并结合认知错误检测；并以 State Builder、Memory Construction、Strategy Planner（动机访谈编码）、Response Generator（问题设想、批评/修订）等模块实现。通过 27 名参与者的真实韩语咨询场景进行评估，包含自动评估的消融分析、用户评估、以及由认证辅导师进行的专家评估。

Result: 全模型在自动评估中持续优于基线及消融模式；用户评估表明参与意图和自然度显著提升；专家评估显示在核心问题理解方面显著改善，且问题产出率接近专业辅导师水平。

Conclusion: 系统性状态建模与主动提问策略能显著提升治疗探索的效率与质量，PsyProbe 在探索阶段的应用具备实用性与有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled mental health dialogue systems, yet existing approaches remain predominantly reactive, lacking systematic user state modeling for proactive therapeutic exploration. We introduce PsyProbe, a dialogue system designed for the exploration phase of counseling that systematically tracks user psychological states through the PPPPPI framework (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective, Impact) augmented with cognitive error detection. PsyProbe combines State Builder for extracting structured psychological profiles, Memory Construction for tracking information gaps, Strategy Planner for Motivational Interviewing behavioral codes, and Response Generator with Question Ideation and Critic/Revision modules to generate contextually appropriate, proactive questions. We evaluate PsyProbe with 27 participants in real-world Korean counseling scenarios, including automatic evaluation across ablation modes, user evaluation, and expert evaluation by a certified counselor. The full PsyProbe model consistently outperforms baseline and ablation modes in automatic evaluation. User evaluation demonstrates significantly increased engagement intention and improved naturalness compared to baseline. Expert evaluation shows that PsyProbe substantially improves core issue understanding and achieves question rates comparable to professional counselors, validating the effectiveness of systematic state modeling and proactive questioning for therapeutic exploration.

TL;DR: 提出 TeMLM，一组关注透明性的临床语言模型发行工件，整合前因、数据、建模透明性与治理为一个可机器检查的发布包，并定义 TeMLM-Card、TeMLM-Datasheet、TeMLM-Provenance 这套工件及轻量化合规检查清单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床语言模型领域，数据与模型透明性、可追溯性与治理需求日益增强，需系统化、可审计的发布工具以提升透明性与合规性，促进可靠部署。

Method: 提出 TeMLM 工件集及轻量化合规清单；在 Technetium-I 这一大规模合成的临床 NLP 数据集上进行实例化，包含 498,000 条笔记、7.74 百万 PHI 实体注释（10 种类型）及 ICD-9-CM 诊断标签；对 ProtactiniumBERT（约 1 亿参数）在 PHI 去标识化（token 分类）和顶级 50 项 ICD-9 代码提取（多标签分类）给出参考结果。

Result: 报告了两个任务的参考结果（PHI 去标识化、ICD-9 代码提取）并强调合成基准对工具与流程验证的价值，同时强调在实际部署前必须在真实临床数据上对模型进行验证。

Conclusion: 合成基准有助于工具化与流程验证，但部署前须在真实数据上进行验证以确保临床适用性与合规性。

Abstract: We introduce TeMLM, a set of transparency-first release artifacts for clinical language models. TeMLM unifies provenance, data transparency, modeling transparency, and governance into a single, machine-checkable release bundle. We define an artifact suite (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a lightweight conformance checklist for repeatable auditing. We instantiate the artifacts on Technetium-I, a large-scale synthetic clinical NLP dataset with 498,000 notes, 7.74M PHI entity annotations across 10 types, and ICD-9-CM diagnosis labels, and report reference results for ProtactiniumBERT (about 100 million parameters) on PHI de-identification (token classification) and top-50 ICD-9 code extraction (multi-label classification). We emphasize that synthetic benchmarks are valuable for tooling and process validation, but models should be validated on real clinical data prior to deployment.

*Chi Zhang,Wenxuan Ding,Jiale Liu,Mingrui Wu,Qingyun Wu,Ray Mooney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 CONTEXT-VQA 数据集，通过对图像-问题对附加具有说服性的文本提示来测试VLM在多模态冲突信息下的鲁棒性；11种SOTA VLMs在仅一次对话的情况下平均性能下降超48.2%，暴露当前模型在文本误导下易被文本覆盖视觉证据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉-语言模型在多模态信息冲突场景下对文本误导的鲁棒性，弥补以往仅在文本或单模态下研究误导的不足，评估VLMs在对抗性对话中的稳健性。

Method: 提出 CONTEXT-VQA 数据集：在图像-问题对基础上生成系统性的说服性提示，故意与视觉证据相冲突；设计评估框架对多模态冲突输入的脆弱性进行基准测试；在11种最先进的VLMs上进行广泛实验，衡量受冲突文本影响的程度。

Result: 实验结果表明VLMs容易被误导文本覆盖视觉证据，在仅一次“说服性对话”后平均性能下降超过48.2%；模型对文本诱导具有高度敏感性。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在文本操纵下的鲁棒性不足，需要提升对文本干扰的防护能力，本文数据集和评估框架有助于推动对多模态鲁棒性的基准性研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on Visual-Question-Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, their robustness against textual misinformation remains under-explored. While existing research has studied the effect of misinformation in text-only domains, it is not clear how VLMs arbitrate between contradictory information from different modalities. To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出在训练初期阶段的权重闭式表达，揭示 transformer 如何通过简单的三类基函数（大词组/二元组、标记可互换性、上下文映射）的组合来捕获语义关联，并在真实大型语言模型上验证理论表达与学习权重的一致性，进而提供对 learned associations 的可解释性分析。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将语言学理论与深度学习联系起来，阐明语言模型如何从自然语言数据中学习语义关联，并为大型语言模型提供一个机械化、可解释的框架。

Method: 基于梯度的领先项近似，推导出训练初期的权重的闭式表达；将变换器的权重分解为三个基函数的简单组合，反映文本语料的统计特征；在真实世界的LLMs上验证推导的权重与实际学习权重的一致性。

Result: 得到的权重表达与实际学习到的权重高度吻合；定性分析揭示三类基函数如何在变换器各组件中协同捕捉语义关联，提升对模型内部机制的解释性。

Conclusion: 提供一个可解释的框架，揭示语义关联在变换器中的形成机制，并将统计文本特征映射到具体的权重结构，为理解和设计更具可解释性的大语言模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Semantic associations such as the link between "bird" and "flew" are foundational for language modeling as they enable models to go beyond memorization and instead generalize and generate coherent text. Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynCABEL 通过大语言模型生成面向所有候选概念的上下文丰富的合成训练样本，解决生物医学实体链接中的专家标注数据匮乏问题；结合解码器模型和引导推断，在英语、法语和西班牙语的主要基准上实现最新性能；数据效率高，最多可用60%更少标注数据达到全监督水平；引入LLM作为评判者以更好评估临床有效性，并发布数据与代码以促进可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域的实体链接严重依赖专家标注数据，标注成本高且覆盖不足，亟需在不大量人工标注情况下获得广泛监督。已有评估往往忽略本体冗余导致的正确性低估，需要更贴近临床有效性的评估方法。

Method: 提出 SynCABEL 框架：利用大语言模型为目标知识库中的所有候选概念生成情境丰富的合成训练样本，提供广泛 supervision。与解码器型模型和引导推断结合，获得强推断能力。并提出 LLM 作为评估者的 protocol 来评价临床有效性。

Result: 在三大多语言基准上达到最新状态：MedMentions（英语）、QUAERO（法语）、SPACCC（西班牙语）。数据效率方面，达到全人工监督水平仅需少量标注数据（最多减少60%标注数据需求）。评估中引入 LLM-评审协议，显示 SynCABEL 显著提升临床有效预测的比率。

Conclusion: 结合合成数据与有引导的推断，显著提升生物医学实体链接的性能与数据效率，降低对人工标注的依赖；并公开数据、模型与代码以支持重复性研究及未来工作，具备良好的多语言适用性和临床实用性潜力。

Abstract: We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 DREAMSTATE 框架，将 RWKV 的状态视为可生成、可编辑的概率流形，并通过条件 Diffusion Transformer (DiT) 建模；并提出将全局上下文并行 DiT 动态生成/调整核心递归模块的 WKV 参数的混合架构，实现上下文感知的动态函数，从而提升 RNN 的局部建模与全局上下文适应性；并给出多目标损失下的稳定训练与可实践性，附代码公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对现代 RNN（如 RWKV）的内部状态作为可编辑的知识表示的研究明显不足，需要将状态建模、编辑与上下文适配性提升结合，填补“可编辑的 RNN 状态”这一研究空缺。

Conclusion: 为 RNN 状态表示开辟了新的研究方向，提供了未来模型设计的具体架构参考，并为可编辑性和全局上下文适配性的结合提供实现路径。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as RWKV, are distinguished by their powerful short-range modeling capabilities and efficient fixed-size states, which constitute a core advantage over standard Transformers. However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

### [15] [RPO-RAG: Aligning Small LLMs with Relation-aware Preference Optimization for Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19225)
*Kaehyun Um,KyuHwan Yeom,Haerim Yang,Minyoung Choi,Hyeongjun Yang,Kyong-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPO-RAG is a KG-based RAG framework tailored for small LLMs (sub-7B) that improves KGQA by introducing a query-path semantic sampling strategy, a relation-aware preference optimization, and an answer-centered prompt design, achieving strong results on WebQSP and CWQ and narrowing the gap to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing KG-based RAG systems: (i) semantics-unaware path sampling and weak alignment with KG reasoning objectives, (ii) lack of answer-centered organization of retrieved knowledge, hindering small LLMs from leveraging retrieved data, and (iii) underexploration of sub-7B backbones for KGQA despite success with larger models.

Method: Three core innovations: (1) query-path semantic sampling to provide informative supervisory signals; (2) relation-aware preference optimization aligning training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); (3) answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths into interpretable formats. The approach targets small LMs and demonstrates improved integration of retrieved KG data into reasoning.

Result: Empirical evaluation on WebQSP and CWQ shows substantial gains for small LLMs: up to 8.8 percentage points improvement in F1 on WebQSP; achieving new state-of-the-art among models under 8B parameters on CWQ for both Hit and F1; overall evidence that RPO-RAG narrows the gap with larger models and enables resource-efficient KGQA, including potential applicability to sub-3B LLMs.

Conclusion: RPO-RAG substantially enhances the reasoning capability of small LLMs for KGQA by aligning retrieval, reasoning, and prompting with KG signals, enabling practical on-device KGQA with sub-7B models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.

### [16] [When Iterative RAG Beats Ideal Evidence: A Diagnostic Study in Scientific Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19827)
*Mahdi Astaraki,Mohammad Arshi Saloot,Ali Shiraee Kasmaee,Hamidreza Mahyar,Soheila Samiee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Iterative RAG with a training-free controller often outperforms Gold Context RAG in chemistry multi-hop QA, yielding up to 25.6 percentage points gains across 11 LLMs; staged retrieval reduces late-hop errors and enables dynamic correction, though several failure modes persist (incomplete hops, distractors, miscalibrated early stopping, composition errors).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning provide gains over an ideal static upper bound (Gold Context) in scientific, multi-hop tasks, and to diagnose mechanism-level factors that govern performance.

Method: Benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes—No Context (rely on parametric memory), Gold Context (oracle evidence provided at once), and Iterative RAG (training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping)—on the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset. Perform mechanism-level diagnostics on retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration.

Result: Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context across models, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and allows dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift. Remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval.

Conclusion: Staged retrieval can be more influential than simply having ideal evidence. The work provides practical deployment and diagnostic guidance for RAG in specialized scientific settings and establishes a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

Result: 实验显示商业模型在对话感知字幕方面仍有较大提升空间；DiaDem 在对话描述准确性方面优于 Gemini 系列，同时在通用音视频字幕基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据与难度分层优化，DiaDem 能在提升对话描述准确性同时维持总体字幕性能；DiaDemBench 提供系统化评估，对未来对话感知字幕的研究具参考价值。

Abstract: Accurate dialogue description in audiovisual video captioning is crucial for downstream understanding and generation tasks. However, existing models generally struggle to produce faithful dialogue descriptions within audiovisual captions. To mitigate this limitation, we propose DiaDem, a powerful audiovisual video captioning model capable of generating captions with more precise dialogue descriptions while maintaining strong overall performance. We first synthesize a high-quality dataset for SFT, then employ a difficulty-partitioned two-stage GRPO strategy to further enhance dialogue descriptions. To enable systematic evaluation of dialogue description capabilities, we introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models across diverse dialogue scenarios, emphasizing both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity in audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments on DiaDemBench reveal even commercial models still exhibit substantial room for improvement in dialogue-aware captioning. Notably, DiaDem not only outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy but also achieves competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个用于构造与评估以类比为基础的谜语的简易流水线；通过三元组创建、语义映射、风格化生成和验证器四模块，评估大语言模型是否能恢复谜语的完整答案集合；结果显示模型通常能猜出主答案，但对其他有效解释往往忽略，显示谜语在评估推理覆盖与歧义处理方面的潜在价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用谜语这一轻量级任务，系统性检验语言模型在类比推理、信息抽取与多解性处理方面的覆盖程度与歧义感知能力。

Method: 设计一个四模块流水线：1) triples creator：构建关于概念的结构化事实三元组；2) semantic mapper：选择有助于构造类比的属性；3) stylized generator：将属性转化为谜语线索；4) validator：收集谜语可能指向的所有答案。通过 validator 检验 LLM 是否能恢复不同谜语类型的完整答案集合。

Result: 案例研究表明，模型往往能找到主要目标答案，但常遗漏其他有效解释，揭示推理覆盖与歧义处理的不足。

Conclusion: 将谜语作为一个轻量化的工具，用于评估语言模型的推理覆盖范围以及对歧义的处理能力。

Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.

TL;DR: DART 通过并行预测未来多位置的 logits，并用带 N-gram 的树剪枝来确保连贯性，显著降低草稿阶段开销并提升端到端解码速度，优于 EAGLE3，且公开代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于模型的草稿设计（如 EAGLE3）在提高草稿准确性的同时需要多步自回归推断，导致草稿阶段延迟高、成为系统性能瓶颈。需要在保持准确度的同时降低草稿阶段的时间开销。

Method: 以目标模型隐藏状态为基础，在单次前向传播中并行预测多个未来被屏蔽位置的 logits，消除草稿模型中的自回归滚动。随后提出高效树剪枝算法，结合 N-gram 强化的语义连贯性，构建高质量草稿 token 树。

Result: 在多组数据集上实现 2.03x~3.44x 的墙钟时间加速，平均领先 EAGLE3 约 30%，并提供开源实现（Code: https://github.com/fvliang/DART）。

Conclusion: DART 显著降低草稿阶段开销并保持草稿阶段的高准确性，从而提升端到端解码速度，提供一个实用且可落地的猜测解码框架。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework. Code is released at https://github.com/fvliang/DART.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 ReToP：端到端的 EHR 重写器与预测器结合的框架，通过分类器监督贡献分数（CSC）对齐重写与预测目标，利用临床驱动的伪标签生成多样化重写，在 MIMIC-IV 上对三个临床预测任务超越强基线，且具备对未见数据集和任务的良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 EHR 的高维性、异质性和稀疏性导致的临床预测挑战；现有的大语言模型往往作为 EHR 编码器或补全模块，未充分将预测任务信号整合进重写过程，限制了预测性能。

Method: 提出 ReToP：端到端训练的 EHR 重写器和临床预测器。为弥补重写训练数据不足，采用临床驱动的特征选择策略生成合成伪标签，得到多样化的患者重写以微调重写器。引入分类器监督贡献（CSC）分数以对齐重写器与预测目标，使重写结果更具临床相关性并提升预测性能。

Result: 在 MIMIC-IV 的三项预测任务中，ReToP 超越了强基线。分析显示具有对未见数据集和任务的良好泛化能力，即使微调极少，同时能保持可解释的重写并强调与预测相关的特征。

Conclusion: 通过将 EHR 重写与预测目标端到端对齐，ReToP 显著提升预测准确性与跨数据集迁移能力，显示将任务信号融入重写过程的潜力；为 LLM 与 EHR 的整合提供新范式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.

TL;DR: MetaGen是一种训练无关的推理时框架，能够在多智能体大语言模型中动态自适应角色空间与协作拓扑。无需更新基础模型权重，即通过对查询条件的角色规范进行重写，维持可控的动态角色库，并在一个最小骨干上构建约束执行图。在执行阶段，迭代更新角色提示与结构决策，使用轻量级反馈信号。实验证明在代码生成和多步推理基准上，相较强基线可提升准确性与成本折衷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统多采用固定的角色库和静态执行拓扑，导致任务错配、难以及时适应新证据、推理成本高。需要一个训练-free、推理阶段可自适应的框架，以提升任务性能与效率。

Method: 提出MetaGen，训练无关的框架，在推理时动态调整角色空间与协作拓扑：(1) 生成并改写查询条件下的角色规范，形成可控的动态角色池；(2) 在最小骨干周围实例化一个受限的执行图；(3) 迭代更新角色提示与结构决策，使用轻量级反馈信号进行指导；(4) 不对基础模型权重进行更新。

Result: 在代码生成和多步推理基准上，MetaGen对比强基线显著提升准确性与成本折衷。

Conclusion: 通过在推理阶段动态自适应角色与协作拓扑，MetaGen实现了无需再训练的多智能体协作优化，提升任务性能并降低推理成本的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as multi-agent systems, where specialized roles communicate and collaborate through structured interactions to solve complex tasks that often exceed the capacity of a single agent. However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.

*Natapong Nitarach,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Formula-One Prompting (F-1)，通过先从题意推导出若干控制方程，再在一个LLM调用内基于方程选择解题策略（CoT/PoT/直接计算），显著提升应用数学领域的解题性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的链式思考（CoT）和程序式思考（PoT）在中间步骤的表达上提升推理，但往往未显式利用待求问题的 governing equations，在金融、物理、密码学等应用场景中，建立或回忆这些方程是关键一步，导致现有方法的效果受限。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：阶段1从题意中形成 governing equations；阶段2基于生成的方程在同一次LLM调用内选择求解策略（CoT、PoT或直接计算），并将选择过程和求解过程统一在一个模型中完成。

Result: 在五个模型和四个基准上，F-1 相较 CoT 提升了平均表现 +5.76%，相较 PoT 提升了 +8.42%。提升在应用领域尤为显著：FinanceMath 上相比 CoT 提升 +13.30%；在 OlympiadBench 的物理子任务相比纯数学有 +2.55% 的提升（而纯数学仅 +0.44%）。

Conclusion: 将方程作为中介表征的 prompting 显著提升了应用数学问题的解题能力，证明方程驱动的推理框架优于单纯的 CoT/PoT，尤其在应用场景中更具优势。

Abstract: Prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) improve LLM mathematical reasoning by structuring intermediate steps in natural language or code. However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%). This demonstrates that F-1 is more effective than CoT in applied mathematics problems.

TL;DR: 提出 DeconIEP，在评估阶段对输入嵌入进行小幅、有界的扰动，通过一个受参考模型指引的实例自适应扰动生成器，消除测试集污染导致的短路记忆效应，同时对清洁输入的性能影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试集污染削弱基准测试的可靠性；现有方法要么修改评估集，要么在评估时抑制污染行为，均有副作用。需要一种仅在评估阶段生效、对正常推理几乎无影响的方法。

Method: 构建一个基于嵌入空间的小扰动生成器，受较少污染的参考模型引导，学习对每个实例自适应的扰动，使被评估模型避免依赖记忆化的捷径；在评估时对输入嵌入施加受控扰动。

Result: 在多种开源权重的LLM及基准上，DeconIEP 展现出较强的去污染效果，同时对无污染输入的性能损失很小，具备良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: 在评估阶段实现去污染的新范式，提升基准比较的可靠性；方法对参考模型依赖和扰动边界等因素应被进一步分析。

Abstract: Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.

TL;DR: 提出一个参考无关、具多维度的评估框架 CEF，用源文本与候选文本作为独立知识库来跨检验，输出 Coverage、Conformity、Consistency 三项分数，在翻译、摘要与临床笔记等任务中提升对语义保真度的诊断能力，并与有参考模式高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如 BLEU 与 BERTScore 不能充分捕捉生成文本的语义保真性，需无参考且可解释的多维评估方法。本文提出鲁棒的评判模型选择策略，并验证框架在多任务上的普适性与可靠性。

Method: 将源文本与候选文本视为独立知识库，CEF 生成可证伪的问题，进行跨检验以得到 Coverage、Conformity、Consistency 三个分数。通过鲁棒性分析选择稳定的 judge 模型，并评估无参考与有参考两种模式的相关性以验证框架的可靠性。

Result: 在翻译、摘要与临床笔记等任务上验证了框架对内容缺失、事实矛盾等关键错误的识别能力，揭示了标准指标的缺陷。无参考模式与有参考模式呈现强相关性，且人工评估表明 CEF 的不匹配问题与语义错误相关性更高，尤其在实体与关系扭曲方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CEF 提供一个可解释、鲁棒且与人工评估一致的参考无关评估框架，适用于多领域文本生成任务，能够有效识别内容缺失、事实冲突等语义层面的错误，作为传统指标的有力补充或替代。

Abstract: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERTScore fail to capture semantic fidelity in generative text-to-text tasks. We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions.

Motivation: MWE identification is challenging due to discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs, plus severe class imbalance. The goal is to build a small, efficient model that can outperform large LLMs on a structured NLP task, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: (1) Reformulate MWE detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction; (2) incorporate NP chunking and dependency features to aid discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs; (3) apply oversampling to address severe class imbalance in training data; and (4) leverage DeBERTa-v3-large as the backbone, evaluate on CoAM and STREUSLE datasets.

Result: 69.8% F1 on CoAM, surpassing Qwen-72B (57.8% F1) by 12 points with 165x fewer parameters; generalizes to STREUSLE with 78.9% F1.

Conclusion: Shows that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments; the method generalizes across datasets (CoAM and STREUSLE).

Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach for multiword expression (MWE) identification that combines binary token-level classification, linguistic feature integration, and data augmentation. Our DeBERTa-v3-large model achieves 69.8% F1 on the CoAM dataset, surpassing the best results (Qwen-72B, 57.8% F1) on this dataset by 12 points while using 165x fewer parameters. We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments.

### [26] [Do LLMs Truly Benefit from Longer Context in Automatic Post-Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19410)
*Ahrii Kim,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proprietary LLMs achieve near-human APE quality with simple prompts, largely ignoring document-level context; open-weight models are weaker; robustness to data poisoning is higher in proprietary models but context utilization remains poor; automatic metrics do not align with human judgments; high cost/latency limits deployment; calls for efficient long-context models for translation refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematically compare proprietary and open-weight LLMs on automatic post-editing (APE) with naive document-level prompting to understand APE quality, context sensitivity, robustness, and efficiency.

Method: Empirical study comparing proprietary and open-weight LLMs using a naive document-level prompting setup; assess APE quality (automatic metrics and human evaluation), document-context usage, robustness to data poisoning, and computational efficiency.

Result: Proprietary LLMs attain near human-level APE quality with one-shot prompts and show higher robustness to data-poisoning attacks; however, they largely fail to leverage document-level context for contextual error correction. Open-weight models lag in quality and robustness. Standard automatic metrics fail to reliably reflect qualitative improvements. Significant cost and latency of proprietary models hinder real-world deployment.

Conclusion: There is promise in LLM-based document-aware APE, but current models reveal limitations in exploiting long-context; future work should focus on efficient long-context modeling and improved evaluation metrics that align with human judgments.

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.
  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.

Conclusion: 通过知识图驱动的对比性问答框架，KG-CRAFT显著提升了基于LLM的事实核查的准确性与可解释性，证明结构化知识对大语言模型在证据推理任务中的价值。

Abstract: Claim verification is a core component of automated fact-checking systems, aimed at determining the truthfulness of a statement by assessing it against reliable evidence sources such as documents or knowledge bases. This work presents KG-CRAFT, a method that improves automatic claim verification by leveraging large language models (LLMs) augmented with contrastive questions grounded in a knowledge graph. KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.

Motivation: 自动化事实核查的需求日益紧迫，手工核查难以扩展；英语资源丰富而葡萄牙语等语言资源匮乏；新闻媒体内容与社交媒体不同，需面向研究的可访问数据集；提升非英语环境中的研究与应用。

Method: 创建ClaimPT数据集：收集自葡萄牙通讯社LUSA的欧洲葡萄牙语新闻文章，1,308篇，6,875条注释；每篇文章由两名标注者标注并由策展人进行质量控制；提出新的注释方案；提供用于陈述检测的基线模型。

Conclusion: ClaimPT 将推进低资源事实核查研究，提升对新闻媒体中错言的理解，促进NLP/IR在葡萄牙语环境中的应用与研究，鼓励未来工作。

Abstract: Fact-checking remains a demanding and time-consuming task, still largely dependent on manual verification and unable to match the rapid spread of misinformation online. This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GradPruner 在 LLM 的早期微调阶段通过梯度信息进行结构化剪枝，构建 IGIA-Matrix 以评估层重要性，将剪枝层与剩余层合并（同符号合并以减少干扰），实现端到端训练与推理效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低对下游任务微调时的时间与硬件成本。现有结构化剪枝往往需要额外的训练、知识蒸馏、结构搜索等步骤，难以实现高效微调。

Method: 在微调初期阶段累积参数梯度，利用初始梯度信息累积矩阵（IGIA-Matrix）评估各层的重要性；对被剪枝的层进行稀疏化，并将其与剩余层合并，仅合并符号相同的元素以降低符号变化带来的干扰；在两种 LLM 上、八个下游数据集上进行广泛实验。

Result: 实现了 40% 的参数量压缩，同时仅导致 0.99% 的准确率下降；实验覆盖医疗、金融以及通用基准任务的两种大规模语言模型。

Conclusion: GradPruner 实现了在下游微调过程中对训练与推理效率的同时提升，且性能损失极小，公开了代码。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.

*Xin Quan,Marco Valentino,Louise A. Dennis,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解-形式化框架，用于将前提-假设对分解为原子步骤的蕴含树，底向上验证以定位失败点，并进行局部诊断驱动的 refinement；引入 θ-substitution 的事件驱动逻辑形式以提升自动形式化的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决将大语言模型与定理证明器结合进行自然语言推理的自形式化错误放大问题、以及难以定位故障点导致需要全局再生成的低效问题，提升解释的可信度与可扩展性。

Method: 将前提-假设对分解为一个原子步骤的蕴含树，逐层自底向上验证以将错误局部化到特定节点；在此基础上进行局部诊断指导的 refinement，而非重生成整段解释；为提高自形式化的可信度，在事件驱动的逻辑形式中引入 θ-替换以确保论元角色绑定的一致性。

Result: 在五种LLM骨干模型覆盖的多项推理任务中，方法实现了最高的解释验证率，相对于现有方法分别提升26.2%、21.7%、21.6%和48.9%； refinement 次数和运行时间显著减少，同时保持较强的NLI准确性。

Conclusion: 该分解-形式化框架提升了自形式化的可信度与解释质量，具备跨模型鲁棒性，适用于长输入和多步推理的自然语言推理任务。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that integrating large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) in neuro-symbolic pipelines helps with entailment verification and proof-guided refinement of explanations for natural language inference (NLI). However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 PIP，通过将目标文本以 [mask] 占位符形式并行生成，在 VrDs 的 KIE 任务中实现单次前向推理完成多字段提取，显著加速推理而几乎不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KIE 在视觉丰富文档中需要同时提取多组独立字段；自回归推理的逐步生成导致较大推理延迟，瓶颈突出，亟需并行化的推理框架以提升实际应用效率。

Method: 将目标值表示为多组 [mask] 占位符，允许在单次前向传播中并行填充所有占位符；设计针对 mask 的预训练策略，以及构建大规模带标注的数据集以支撑并行填充能力；在模型架构和训练目标上适配并行输出。

Result: 实现 5-36 倍的推理速度提升，且性能相比自回归基线仅有轻微下降，展示在效率与准确性之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: PIP 为 KIE 提供高效、可扩展的并行推理范式，有望推动 VrDs 场景下的实际落地应用。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.

*Zihou Zhang,Zheyong Xie,Li Zhong,Haifeng Liu,Shaosheng Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过在扩散语言模型中增加一个额外的“sink”标记来稳定注意力的汇聚现象（attention sinks），该标记仅对自身进行注意，但对其他标记全局可见。该标记能有效稳定移动的sink，显著提升模型性能；其语义内容可忽略且与位置无关，证明其作为结构性汇聚点的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散语言模型中的移动sink现象带来的推理鲁棒性问题。移动sink导致信息混合不稳定，影响推断稳定性和生成质量。

Method: 在注意力掩码中引入一个特殊token，使其仅关注自身，但对所有其他token全局可见，从而充当结构性sink。通过对sink的表征范数、注意力分布及性能等进行分析，评估其稳定性与鲁棒性。

Result: 引入单一额外token显著稳定注意力sinks，提升模型性能。分析表明该token的效果与其位置无关，且语义内容极低，验证其作为鲁棒结构性sink的作用。

Conclusion: 极简的注意力掩码修改即可带来显著的稳定性提升与性能改进，适用于DLMs并可能推广至其他扩散类模型；该结构性sink的存在不依赖具体语义信息，强调设计上对信息混合控制的作用。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.

Result: 与随机等效大小扰动相比，基于子类型靶向扰动能产生更系统、具失语样的退化；MoE 的模块化结构在实现更加局部化且可解释的表型与组件映射方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 在可控的模块化 LLM 框架中，结合临床导向的扰动，可以有效仿真失语语言产出，并为研究受损语言功能在定向干扰下的衰退机制提供平台，具有康复研究与语言组织结构探索的潜在应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.

Result: 在 Llama3.2 1B 等规模的模型上实现显存显著下降（约为基线的 14.8%），并达到与或优于基线的微调性能；并通过可解释的 token 寻找过程提供对 token 级别效率的洞察。

Conclusion: TokenSeek 提供了一种通用、可解释且高效的微调记忆优化路径，适用于大多数 transformer 基模型，推动往 token 级别的高效性研究与应用。

Abstract: Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

Abstract: For generative AI agents to partner effectively with human users, the ability to accurately predict human intent is critical. But this ability to collaborate remains limited by a critical deficit: an inability to model common ground.

We release the online pipeline for data collection, the tools and analyses for accuracy, efficiency, and lexical overlap, and a corpus of 356 dialogues (89 pairs over 4 rounds each) that unmasks LVLMs' limitations in interactively resolving referring expressions, a crucial skill that underlies human language use.

Abstract: Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text. However, in real-world social media scenarios, targets are neither predefined nor static but rather complex and dynamic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.

TL;DR: AdaRAS是一种轻量化的测试时框架，通过识别并自适应调整推理关键神经元的激活来提升LLMs的推理可靠性，无需额外训练或采样开销，在数学/编程基准上表现出稳定提升（如AIME-24/AIME-25超13%）。

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型具备强推理能力，但在困难任务上的稳定表现往往需要代价高昂的后训练或采样策略。研究发现少量神经元与推理正确性具有强Predictive相关性，可被用来在推理阶段进行干预以提高可靠性。

Method: 提出Reasoning-Critical Neurons（RCNs）并基于极性感知的均值差异准则进行识别；在推理过程中自适应地干预这些神经元的激活，以增强错误推理的痕迹并避免对已正确推理的案例造成降级。

Result: 在10个数学与编程基准上实现一致性提升；在AIME-24/25上分别取得超过13%的增益；具备较强的跨数据集可迁移性，且能扩展到更强模型；相比后训练方法，在不增加训练或采样成本的前提下表现优于它们。

Conclusion: AdaRAS提供了一种高效的、无需额外训练的测试时干预机制，通过选择性地激活推理关键神经元来提升推理可靠性，并具备良好的迁移性与可扩展性，成为成本更低的替代方案。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on challenging tasks often requires post-training or computationally expensive sampling strategies, limiting their practical efficiency. In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.

*Nicholas Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reflective Translation: A prompt-based two-pass translation framework for low-resource languages (English–isiZulu/English–isiXhosa) where an initial translation is critique by the model and refined in a second pass. Evaluated on OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, showing consistent BLEU/COMET gains (up to +0.22 BLEU, +0.18 COMET) across prompting strategies and confidence thresholds; model-agnostic with no fine-tuning and a reflection-augmented dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and resource limitations in MT for low-resource languages. Leverage self-reflection prompts to improve reasoning and factual consistency in translations.

Method: Generate initial translation; produce a structured self-critique; use the critique to generate a refined second translation. Explore multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Evaluate on OPUS-100 and NTREX-African for English–isiZulu/isiXhosa. No model fine-tuning; method is model-agnostic; introducing a reflection-augmented dataset.

Result: Second-pass translations consistently outperform first-pass translations in BLEU and COMET across both language pairs and datasets. Average gains up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance confirmed by paired nonparametric tests.

Conclusion: Structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism to enhance translation quality in low-resource settings. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and the reflection dataset enables future supervised or analysis-driven work.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.

*Luis Lorenzo,Marcos Montana-Mendez,Sergio Figueiras,Miguel Boubeta,Cristobal Bernardo-Castineira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出 ONCOTIMIA，通过 GenAI 支持肺癌 MDTB 表单自动完成，六种 LLM 在 10 例病例上评估，最高 80% 字段正确完成，大模型在可接受延迟下具更高准确性，提示在多学科合作流程中具技术可行性与操作性潜力，能显著减轻文档负担.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多学科肿瘤板 MDTB 虽在肿瘤治疗决策中核心作用，但文档工作量大、信息源异构、需结构化处理，造成显著的文档负担。开发可与工作流集成的 GenAI 工具以自动化转换非结构化文本为结构化 MDTB 记录具有重要意义。

Method: 提出 ONCOTIMIA，采用分层数据湖、关系型+向量混合存储、检索增强生成(RAG)以及规则驱动的自适应表单模型，将非结构化临床文档转为结构化、标准化的 MDTB 记录。通过 AWS Bedrock 部署六种 LLM，在 10 个肺癌病例上评估，测量字段完成准确性和端到端时延。

Result: 在六种 LLM 的组合配置中，最佳配置实现约 80% 的字段正确完成，且对大多数模型的响应时间在临床可接受范围内。更大、更新的模型在不产生不可接受延迟的前提下获得更高的准确性。

Conclusion: LLM 辅助的 MDTB 表单自动完成在肺癌多学科工作流中在技术上可行且具操作性潜力，能够显著降低文档负担并保持数据质量；但样本量有限、需进一步在更大范围与多场景下验证，并关注模型差异、延迟与合规性等问题。

Abstract: Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.

### [40] [LLM Driven Design of Continuous Optimization Problems with Controllable High-level Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18846)
*Urban Skvorc,Niki van Stein,Moritz Seiler,Britta Grimme,Thomas Bäck,Heike Trautmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper uses a large language model embedded in an evolutionary loop (LLaMEA) to automatically design continuous black-box benchmark functions with predefined landscape properties. It employs LLM-driven code generation from natural-language target descriptions, ELA-based property predictors, and an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism to diversify landscapes. Basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical tests, and visual inspection validate that generated functions exhibit the intended traits, while t-SNE shows expansion of the BBOB problem space. The result is a broad, interpretable, and reproducible benchmark library for landscape analysis and automated algorithm selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the structural diversity of continuous black-box benchmark suites beyond existing collections (e.g., BBOB) by enabling the on-demand generation of test functions with controllable landscape characteristics.

Method: Use the LLaMEA framework to guide an LLM to encode natural-language target properties (multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity, global/local optima contrast) into executable problem code. In-loop evaluation relies on ELA-based property predictors; an ELA-space fitness-sharing scheme increases population diversity and reduces landscape redundancy. Complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing, and visual inspection verify trait alignment. A t-SNE embedding assesses coverage of the BBOB instance space.

Result: A generated library of benchmark functions that exhibit the intended structural traits, with evidence from basin-attraction analyses, statistics, and visuals. The functions occupy a broader region of the landscape space, not just a cluster around existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted landscape design within an evolutionary loop can produce diverse, interpretable, and reproducible benchmark problems, expanding the BBOB instance space and enabling more robust landscape analysis and automated algorithm selection.

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

*Qusai Khaled,Bahjat Mallak,Uzay Kaymak,Laura Genga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于区间型-2自适应模糊推理系统的能量预测区间，能解释性地分解不确定性，同时保持与一阶ANFIS相近的预测性能，且训练方差显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污水处理厂的能耗占全球电力消耗的1-3%，需要在运营优化与可持续性框架下获得可解释的不确定性量化，以支持风险感知型决策；相比黑箱概率方法，区间型-2模糊系统提供可解释的区间预测。

Method: 提出IT2-ANFIS框架，利用区间型-2模糊逻辑与自适应模糊推理，通过模糊规则结构生成可解释的预测区间。将不确定性分解为四层：特征层级的变量不确定性、不确定性足迹识别变量贡献、规则层级对局部模型的置信度、实例层级的全局预测区间。在Melbourne Water Eastern Treatment Plant数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在预测性能方面与一阶ANFIS相当，但训练结果方差显著降低；提供可解释的不确定性估计，能将预测置信度直接关联到运行条件与输入变量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多层次、不确定性可解释化的区间预测，提升对运行条件下能耗的风险感知能力，适用于安全关键基础设施的能耗预测与运维决策。

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

### [42] [RIFT: Reordered Instruction Following Testbed To Evaluate Instruction Following in Singular Multistep Prompt Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18924)
*Andrew Jaffe,Noah Reicin,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIFT reveals that prompt topology, especially non-sequential 'jumping' prompts, severely degrades instruction-following in LLMs, with up to a 72% accuracy drop; about half of errors arise from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, suggesting a sequential bias in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Isolate the effect of prompt structure on instruction following by decoupling content from structure, addressing a confound in benchmarks that conflates task complexity with ordering.

Method: Introduce Reordered Instruction Following Testbed (RIFT) using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs to compare linear prompts (sequential) and jumping prompts (non-sequential) across 10,000 evaluations in six open-source LLMs.

Result: Accuracy drops up to 72% under jumping prompts; error analysis shows ~50% due to instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating instruction following is learned as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill.

Conclusion: Structural sensitivity is a fundamental limitation of current LLM architectures, with implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow (e.g., workflow automation, multi-agent systems).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出 NTP4VC，首个面向真实世界多语言程序验证的自动VC证明基准，评估大语言模型在VC证明中的能力，揭示显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动证明条件（VCs）在实际程序验证中是瓶颈；现有ATP难以解决困难VC；尽管NTP在数学领域取得进展，但在程序验证中的应用尚未充分探索；需要一个真实世界、跨语言的基准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 构建基准 NTP4VC：从 Linux/Contiki-OS 内核等实际项目中，借助 Why3 和 Frama-C 等工业管线生成等价的测试用例，覆盖 Isabelle、Lean、Rocq 等形式化语言。对通用和专门微调的大语言模型进行VC证明评估，观察其在程序验证中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs 对 VC 证明展现出一定潜力，但在现实世界的程序验证场景下仍存在显著挑战，存在较大差距，需进一步研究改进数据、模型和推理能力。

Conclusion: NTP4VC 为自动VC证明确立了首个真实世界多语言基准，揭示改进空间与研究方向，促使将机器学习方法与形式化验证相结合的后续工作。

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

*Nanhan Shen,Zhilei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 UA-3DTalk：一个面向情感性三维语音-面部合成的不确定性感知框架，通过先验提取、情感蒸馏和基于不确定性的变形实现对情感瞬态表情的细粒控制及自适应多视角融合，在情感对齐、嘴型同步和渲染质量等方面超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三维情感口型合成方法在音视频情感对齐（难以从音频提取情感信息、难以控制微表情）以及多视角融合中“统一权重”策略导致渲染质量不足。需要更细粒度的情感提取、可控的情感微表情以及对视角不确定性的建模与自适应融合。

Method: 提出 UA-3DTalk，包含三大模块：1) 先验提取模块，将音频分解为用于对齐的内容同步特征与用于个体化的人特异互补特征；2) 情感蒸馏模块，采用多模态注意力加权融合和4D 高斯编码，配合多分辨率码本实现细粒度音情感提取与对情感微表情的精准控制；3) 基于不确定性的变形模块，利用不确定性块估计视图特定的 epistemic（模型参数）与 aleatoric（输入噪声）不确定性，进行自适应多视角融合，并通过多头解码器对高斯原始块进行优化，缓解统一权重融合的局限。

Result: 在常规数据集与情感数据集上的广泛实验显示，UA-3DTalk 在情感对齐的 E-FID、唇同步的 SyncC 以及渲染质量的 LPIPS 指标上，分别比 DEGSTalk 与 EDTalk 提升约 5.2%、3.1%、0.015。

Conclusion: 通过将情感先验、多模态情感蒸馏与不确定性驱动的自适应多视角融合相结合，UA-3DTalk 能在音视频情感对齐、嘴型同步和渲染质量上实现显著性能提升，验证了不确定性建模与情感先验在三维情感口型合成中的有效性。

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Motivation: 现有用于提升FC能力的数据要么依赖人工标注，要么由模型自动生成，常受固定模式和数据分布的约束，导致泛化性和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 引入一个通过强化学习训练的查询模型来生成对抗性查询；在零和博弈设定下，查询模型与FC模型进行交替训练，以逐步暴露并修正FC模型的薄弱环节。

Result: 提出的训练框架可系统性地识别并修正FC对外部工具交互的薄弱点，理论上提升鲁棒性与泛化，但文中未给出具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升大语言模型与外部工具交互的鲁棒性提供了一种系统性的对抗性数据增强范式，能够帮助发现并纠正模型在函数调用任务中的弱点。

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

TL;DR: TS-Debate introduces a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. It assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, uses explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates through a structured debate protocol with reviewer verification and lightweight code execution for verification. It reports consistent, significant gains over baselines across 20 tasks on three benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and cross-modal integration in time series tasks. There is a need for robust zero-shot reasoning that preserves modality fidelity and mitigates numeric hallucinations without fine-tuning.

Method: A modular agent framework where specialized agents process different modalities (text, visuals, numerics) and engage in a structured debate. Domain knowledge elicitation precedes interaction. Reviewer agents perform verification-conflict-calibration on agent claims, aided by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification.

Result: Across 20 tasks on three public benchmarks, TS-Debate yields consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including a standard multimodal debate where all agents observe inputs.

Conclusion: The architecture preserves modality fidelity, surfaces conflicting evidence, and reduces numeric hallucinations, achieving robust TS reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 的注意力推理随序列长度的增加而高成本，KV 缓存用于降低推理延时，但在大规模用户场景中存储开销显著，因此需要在降低存储成本的同时保持性能。

Method: 通过分析跨用户 KV 的相似性，利用奇异值分解(SVD)将 KV 信息分解为可共享的部分与用户特异的部分；提出全局 KV 池来学习共享信息，在推理时从池中检索高维共享 KV，并与低维用户特异 KV 拼接以形成最终 KV。

Result: 在五个序列推荐模型和三个数据集上，方法将 KV 缓存压缩至原始的0.8%，同时维持或提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 跨用户 KV 共享机制显著降低缓存存储开销，在保持性能的同时提升对长序列的适用性，适用于大规模用户的低延迟推荐场景。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

TL;DR: CoReTab introduces a code-driven reasoning framework that couples multi-step reasoning with executable Python code to produce scalable, interpretable, and verifiable annotations for multimodal table understanding, accompanied by a large dataset (115K samples, ~529 tokens per response) and a three-stage fine-tuning pipeline that yields notable gains on 17 MMTab benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal table understanding datasets (e.g., MMTab) provide short factual answers and lack explicit multi-step reasoning supervision, leading to limited interpretability and potentially lower accuracy. There is a need for a scalable framework that yields interpretable, verifiable reasoning traces to improve multi-step reasoning in multimodal table tasks.

Method: Introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that integrates multi-step reasoning with executable Python code to generate annotations. Curate a dataset of 115K verified samples with average 529 tokens per response. Fine-tune open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) via a three-stage pipeline.

Result: The model trained on CoReTab achieves significant gains on 17 MMTab benchmarks across three task categories: table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding, with improvements of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6% respectively, while providing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: CoReTab is a robust and generalizable supervision framework that enhances multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding by coupling reasoning with executable code, enabling scalable data generation and interpretable, verifiable traces.

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

TL;DR: A memory-driven adaptive agent framework (MAGNET) for mobile GUI tasks that uses dual-level memories (stationary visual-to-semantics mapping and procedural task memories) with dynamic memory evolution to maintain robust action grounding across UI changes, achieving improved performance and robustness on AndroidWorld benchmarks under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents trained on historical UI data fail when interfaces change; however, the underlying functional semantics and task intents are relatively stable. Exploiting stable structures through memory can improve generalization across evolving interfaces.

Method: MAGNET introduces dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding, and procedural memory capturing stable task intents. A dynamic memory evolution mechanism prioritizes frequently accessed knowledge to continually refine both memories.

Result: Online AndroidWorld benchmarks show substantial improvements over baselines; offline benchmarks show consistent gains under distribution shifts, indicating better generalization to interface changes.

Conclusion: Leveraging stable structures across interface changes via memory-guided grounding improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

*Yongxin Deng,Zhen Fang,Yixuan Li,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 SpikeScore，用于跨领域泛化的幻觉检测。通过量化多轮对话中初始回应后不确定性的突变，实现对幻觉与非幻觉回应的跨域高效分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测在同一领域内表现良好，但跨领域泛化差，需设计能在单一领域训练后对相关领域具鲁棒性的检测方法。

Method: 系统研究在多轮对话中 LLP 的初始回应后，幻觉会引发更大且更不稳定的不确定性波动。提出 SpikeScore 以量化多轮对话中的突变/波动，结合理论分析与经验验证，证明其在跨域上对幻觉与非幻觉回应具较强的分离性。并在多种大型语言模型与基准数据上进行实验。

Result: SpikeScore 在跨域场景下对幻觉与非幻觉响应的可分性显著优于基线方法，并超过面向泛化的先进方法，验证了方法的跨域鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 基于对多轮对话中不确定性的突变感知，SpikeScore 提供了一种有效的跨域幻觉检测方案，适用于不同模型与数据集的跨域部署。

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 引入RPO（Partial Reasoning Optimization），在强化微调中仅生成推理路径的后缀并利用经验缓存来训练，从而大幅降低 rollout 时的 token 生成量，实现显著的训练时间加速，同时保持与全路径方法相当的性能，可与GRPO、DAPO等算法结合使用且代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大语言模型强化微调中需要生成完整推理轨迹（全路径）所带来的高计算开销；希望通过只生成推理的部分内容并复用历史经验来降低成本，同时保持结果质量。

Method: 分析推理路径各段对最终正确性的影响，提出RPO算法：在训练阶段，仅生成推理路径的后缀，并使用经验缓存来提供训练样本，显著减少 rollout 的 token 生成量（约95%），并可与现有强化微调算法（如GRPO、DAPO）结合以实现加速和性能保持。

Conclusion: RPO提供一种可插拔的强化微调加速策略，通过局部（后缀）推理和经验缓存实现显著的计算节约，同时兼容现有强化微调框架，具有良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purifying sour water 以减少排放、腐蚀和环境风险，并实现 treated water 的再利用；同时通过自动化降低工人暴露风险，并使非专业人员也能有效操作。

Method: 构建模糊专家系统控制器并与定制数字孪生协同工作；数字孪生通过 Honeywell UniSim Design R492 进行工业行为仿真；阀门动力通过 MATLAB 系统辨识建模，采用 OPC DA 进行实时数据交换；对两阀应用分区控制，使用五种去燥(defuzzification)策略，在21种初始压力条件下进行105种情景测试；以 MSE、RMSE、MAE、IAE、ISE、ITAE 等误差指标及超调/回落等动态指标评估；并开发 Python/Streamlit 的网页仿真界面。

Conclusion: 将模糊专家系统与数字孪生整合用于 sour water 处理具有通用性，可扩展至其他工业过程；但需进一步在真实工艺中验证鲁棒性、稳定性及参数敏感性，并给出更详细的规则库、去燥策略比较与对比研究。

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities.

Conclusion: A-CEoH 有效且领域无关，能提高 A* 启发式设计的自动化和性能，具备跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Motivation: 现有基于激活的安全方法对广泛滥用数据集进行训练，存在精度低、灵活性不足、可解释性欠缺等问题；需一个可解释、可定制、可审计的安全框架以提升检测效果并降低维护成本。

Method: 将激活拆解为可解释的认知元素（CEs），如“威胁表达”“支付处理”等，构建可组合的谓词规则以检测违规行为；实现实时评估并提供无需重新训练的配置与更新机制，同时提供开源框架与自动规则生成工具。

Conclusion: 规则化、可组合的激活安全为可解释、可审计、可扩展的 AI 治理奠定基础，GAVEL 框架与自动规则工具有望促进在实际场景中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Routing natural language queries across large, domain-overlapping multi-database repositories is challenging due to ambiguity and structural diversity; there is a need for robust, reasoning-based approaches beyond surface embeddings.

Method: Construct realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets. Propose a modular reranking strategy that explicitly models schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment to guide routing decisions, incorporating reasoning components rather than sole embeddings or prompts.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning with explicit modeling of schema and connectivity improves NL-to-SQL routing in multi-database settings, suggesting broader applicability of modular reasoning-driven approaches for complex cross-database retrieval tasks.

Abstract: We address the task of routing natural language queries in multi-database enterprise environments. We construct realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets.

Motivation: 探究何时视觉生成能充当更自然、更强大的世界模型以提升推理能力，提出视觉优势假说并将世界建模作为CoT推理的核心。

Method: 将内部世界建模公式化并比较不同形式的世界模型；构建 VisWorld-Eval 数据集；在最先进的统一多模态模型（UMM）上进行受控实验，比较交错的视觉-语言CoT 与纯语言CoT的推理表现。

Result: 在偏向视觉世界建模的任务上，交错CoT显著优于纯语言CoT；在其他任务上未观察到明显优势。

Conclusion: 多模态世界建模具有提升推理能力的潜力，但效果依赖于任务性质，需要进一步明确何时采用跨模态推理以实现更人类化的多模态AI。

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

Motivation: 高维潜变量在 VAE 中往往分布在球面赤道上，导致异常检测困难且生成能力受限；需要一种更具表达性的潜变量建模以克服高维统计挑战。

Conclusion: 球面潜变量建模为高维 VAE 提供更稳健的异常检测与生成能力，扩展了 VAE 的适用性；未来工作可关注实现成本、数值稳定性和对不同数据域的泛化。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

TL;DR: 将互动的投影学习与聚类结合，用户通过 Must-Link/Cannot-Link 约束迭代调整非线性嵌入，提升2D布局下的聚类效果，并映射回原始特征以获得可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据聚类困难在于距离度量的效用下降、低维投影易导致簇塌/重叠，且传统降维嵌入缺乏可解释性与互动性，难以融入分析师直觉。

Method: 引入一个非线性投影模块与用户反馈循环，用户可通过调整视角与提供约束（如 must-link/cannot-link）来重新优化投影目标；约束改变投影的优化目标，使相关点拉近、无关点拉远；在优化后的2D布局上应用传统聚类；最后将发现的簇映射回原始特征空间，给出可解释的规则或特征排序。

Result: 在多组基准数据集上，少量交互 refinement 即可显著提升聚类质量。

Conclusion: IPBC 将聚类转化为协同发现过程，机器表征与人类洞察相互强化。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 存在显著的通道层面差异，且基于统一的、通道无关的损失函数（如MSE）往往无法捕捉不同通道的独特动态（如尖峰波动、趋势变化），因此需要通道自适应的感知空间来提升预测性能。

Method: 提出一个可学习的通道级滤波器，将原始信号分解为可解耦的多尺度表示，作为感知空间的基础。该滤波器与主预测模型共同优化，使学习到的感知空间直接服务于预测任务。最终在各自的感知空间内计算并优化损失。

Conclusion: CP Loss 通过为每个通道构建专属的感知空间并在该空间中计算损失，旨在更好地捕捉通道特性，从而提升多通道时序预测的效果；代码可在给定的GitHub 地址获取。

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task.

### [64] [How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830)
*Alireza Jafari,Fatemeh Jafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNN+RNN comparison for multi-label ECG classification on PTB-XL; single BiLSTM with CNN offers best trade-off, deeper RNNs yield diminishing returns and can harm generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether complex recurrent architectures are necessary for modeling long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead ECG classification and to establish the most efficient architecture for clinical deployment.

Method: Systematic evaluation of CNN-based architectures combined with LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and stacked variants on PTB-XL (23 diagnostic categories). The CNN acts as morphology-based baseline; recurrent layers added to assess temporal modeling impact. Performance measured via Hamming loss, macro-AUPRC, micro-F1, and subset accuracy.

Result: CNN with a single BiLSTM layer achieved the best balance of performance and model complexity (e.g., Hamming loss 0.0338, macro-AUPRC 0.4715, micro-F1 0.6979, subset accuracy 0.5723). Deeper recurrent stacks did not consistently improve performance; while they may boost recall for rare classes, they often reduce precision and overfit, leading to worse generalization.

Conclusion: Align architectural choices with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals rather than pursuing deeper recurrent stacks; a CNN+single BiLSTM configuration offers robust, clinically viable performance with favorable complexity trade-offs.

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

TL;DR: 提出训练无关的几何推理框架 TGR，在严格内存约束下通过块边界的潜在锚点前瞻搜索与软几何正则实现高效的长链式推理覆盖，观测到覆盖质量显著提升；对 Qwen3-8B，Pass@k 的 AUC 最多提升约 13 点，额外开销约为 1.1–1.3 倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长链式推理中训练成本与覆盖质量之间的根本权衡。在内存受限场景下提高鲁棒轨迹覆盖，减少冗余轨迹，同时保持较低的计算开销。

Method: TGR 为训练-free 框架：在每个块边界对候选 latent anchors 进行轻量前瞻估计，并结合软几何正则以鼓励轨迹平滑与探索多样性；采用分块的 KV 缓存重置，使内存复杂度随块长度线性增长，避免全局记忆膨胀。

Result: 在具挑战性的数学与代码基准上，TGR 提升鲁棒轨迹覆盖的面积下的曲线（AUC），对 Qwen3-8B 的提升幅度达到最多 13 点；额外开销仅约 1.1–1.3 倍。

Conclusion: 提供一种高效、训练-free 的方法来提升长链推理的覆盖质量，同时保持线性内存开销，降低对训练资源的依赖。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

TL;DR: 将Bellman残差最小化引入策略优化（控制）领域，建立其理论基础；相较于动态规划，残差最小化在带函数近似时具有更稳定的收敛性潜力，本文为控制情境下的残差最小化提供基础理论。

Motivation: 尽管在策略评估中已广泛研究Bellman残差最小化，但在策略优化/控制任务中的应用研究仍然不足。本研究旨在弥补这一空缺，探讨控制问题中的Bellman残差最小化的可行性与理论性质。

Method: 提出并分析控制情境下的Bellman残差最小化框架，明确目标函数的形式、收敛性与稳定性条件，奠定后续算法设计的理论基础。

Result: 给出控制问题中Bellman残差最小化的基础理论结果与分析框架，确立该方向的可行性与潜在优势，为未来的模型自由/强化学习实现提供理论支撑。

Conclusion: 在策略优化任务中应用Bellman残差最小化具有理论可行性与潜在稳定性优势，值得进一步深入研究并拓展至实际算法与模型自由场景。

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

### [67] [Representational Homomorphism Predicts and Improves Compositional Generalization In Transformer Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18858)
*Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结构性指标“同态误差（HE）”，用于衡量表达式代数与模型隐藏状态之间的近似同态性偏离，从而诊断并提升神经模型的成分通约泛化能力（compositional generalization）。在SCAN风格任务的两类操作符（修饰符一元、序列二元）上实现并评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为评估能揭示模型何时失败，但对失败原因的表征层面缺乏洞察。需要一个能将代数结构与模型隐藏状态联系起来的诊断性度量以及可用于训练的信号，以提高对熟悉组成部分的新组合的泛化能力。

Method: 在SCAN风格任务中对两类组合操作符实现HE：修饰符（单元组合）和序列（双元组合），通过学习预测由部分构成的表示来得到表示层次的操作符。采用解码器独立的Transformer进行控制实验，评估HE在噪声注入下对OOD成分泛化的预测能力（modifier HE 与 OOD准确率的R^2=0.73）。通过消融研究探索深度、数据覆盖和噪声对HE与OOD性能的影响，并在训练中显式对低修饰符HE进行正则化以提升OOD准确度。

Result: HE能够在表示层级对比组成结构的偏离，预测OOD泛化，且对修饰符HE与序列HE的下降与OOD准确率提升具有显著相关性。深度对HE和OOD影响小，数据覆盖存在阈值效应，随机噪声增大HE。HE正则化显著降低修饰符HE与序列HE（分别p=1.1×10^-4和p=0.001），并带来OOD准确度的显著提升（p=0.023）。代码开源。

Conclusion: HE既是诊断性指标，也是可操作的训练信号，能帮助提高成分通约泛化能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization-the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar components-remains a persistent challenge for neural networks. Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.

*Shalima Binta Manir,Tim Oates*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个统一理论框架，将曲率引导重连与位置几何结合，利用标签信息（LI）来判断何时几何感知 GNN 能优于仅特征的方法；通过 ASEHybrid 实现，给出必要充分条件；理论结果包括 LI 与谱行为、Forman 曲率对表达力的界限、收敛性与 Lipschitz 稳定性；实验在多数据集上验证，仅在标签信息丰富的异质性数据集有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何普通 GNN 在低同质性图上表现不佳，以及同质性不足以解释差异；引入标签信息熵（LI）作为更具解释力的信号，统一曲率重连与定位几何的框架。

Method: 构造一个统一框架，结合曲率引导的重连与位置编码，通过 LI 确定何时使用几何信息；在此框架下实例化为 ASEHybrid，采用 Forman 曲率和 Laplacian 位点编码，并在 Chameleon、Squirrel、Texas、Tolokers、Minesweeper 上进行控制消融。

Result: 给出必要且充分的条件：若图结构承载超出节点特征的标签相关信息，几何感知 GNN 可在一定程度上超越特征仅基线；理论关联包括 LI 与标签信号的拉普拉斯平滑下谱行为、曲率对信息流的重塑、以及对重连过程的收敛与 Lipschitz 稳定性；实证表明在标签信息丰富的异质性数据集存在性能提升，而在高基线场景提升不显著。

Conclusion: 若图结构提供额外的标签相关信息，几何感知 GNN（如 ASEHybrid）可显著优于仅特征模型；在标签信息不足或高基线场景中，几何信息的收益有限。

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

Motivation: 负边破坏图的同质性假设，使常规图方法难以直接应用。需要直接建模边之间的潜在统计依赖。naive 边-边关系建模计算不可行。因此扩展 CopulaGNN 到边级，同时提供可扩展的推断和理论收敛保障。

Method: 将边边相关矩阵表示为边嵌入的 Gramian；重参数化条件概率以大幅降低推断成本；扩展 CopulaGNN 到边级，并给出线性收敛性的理论证明。

Result: 实验表明相比基线模型，该方法实现显著更快的收敛，同时保持与SOTA模型相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为有符号图的边符号预测提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，兼具收敛性和预测性能。

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于预测状态表示（PSR）和张量分解的学习框架，用于从行动-观测序列中学习离散POMDP的转移与观测矩阵。方法通过相似变换不变性在分区级别估计参数，分区内状态具有相同观测分布，且在分区对应的转移矩阵为满秩的条件下实现区分。实验显示分区级模型在数据充足时可达到与PSR在POMDP求解中的性能，并且显式的观测/转移似然性便于后续规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从行动和观测序列中学习含隐藏状态的离散POMDP的问题，现有方法要么能估计隐藏状态数量（如PSR），要么在全观测且转移矩阵满秩假设下估计参数，难以在更一般的情形下获得可直接用于规划的参数。

Method: 将PSR用于估计转移与观测矩阵，但仅在相似变换意义下估计；引入张量方法来估计参数；提出分区状态聚合，即同一分区内的状态对某些行动具有相同的观测分布，且当对应的转移矩阵为满秩时，分区内的模型可被区分；学习得到的分区级转移和观测矩阵可用于标准采样POMDP求解器。

Result: 实验表明，在数据充足时，分区级转移模型的表现可达到与PSR相当的水平，足以作为POMDP求解器的模型；并且显式的概率参数有助于在学习后设计规划策略。

Conclusion: 在放宽全观测与全秩假设的前提下，通过分区级PSR学习获得的转移与观测参数可用于规划并提升可解释性，且可与张量分解方法结合实现对隐藏状态的推断与求解。

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

*Xin Qiao,Shijie Sun,Anqi Dong,Cong Hua,Xia Zhao,Longfei Zhang,Guangming Zhu,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage graph feature imputation framework (FSD-CAP) using graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion and fractional diffusion for local propagation, followed by class-aware refinement with pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy; achieves near full-feature performance under 99.5% missing features across multiple datasets, outperforming other models on large-scale and heterophily graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imputing missing node features under extreme sparsity is challenging; existing latent representations and global diffusion methods can propagate errors and yield unreliable estimates. A localized, adaptive diffusion strategy paired with a consistency-driven refinement could improve imputation quality and downstream tasks.

Method: Stage 1: graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion to localize diffusion; apply fractional diffusion operator to adjust propagation sharpness based on local structure. Stage 2: class-aware propagation that uses pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to enforce consistency during refinement of imputed features. Evaluation on multiple datasets with 99.5% missing features for node classification and link prediction.

Result: Node classification under 99.5% missing: ~80.06% (structural) and 81.01% (uniform), close to 81.31% of full-feature GCN. Link prediction AUC under same missing rate: ~91.65% (structural) and 92.41% (uniform), vs 95.06% for fully observed. Superior performance on large-scale and heterophily datasets compared to other models.

Conclusion: FSD-CAP effectively imputes missing node features under extreme sparsity, delivering competitive to near state-of-the-art performance across tasks and datasets, with robustness to graph scale and heterophily.

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Motivation: 传统方法（如Nelder-Mead）在样品效率和多参数耦合方面存在局限，深度学习方法虽然速度快但需大量 retraining，缺乏对不同样品条件的灵活适应性。需要一种数据高效、可自定义目标且能在实验中自适应的优化框架，以维持高通量STEM在漂移环境中的最优性能。

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

### [76] [When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18973)
*Nima Leclerc,Chris Miller,Nicholas Brawand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出元学习自适应增益的下界，增益随梯度步数呈指数饱和、与任务方差线性相关。量子门校准中，低方差任务收益微弱；在训练噪声放大10倍的极端OOD情形下，两量子比特门可实现>40%保真度提升。经典线性二次控制验证表明规律源自一般优化几何，而非量子特性。提供可迁移的自适应控制决策框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件的固有设备异质性与环境漂移使得只能选择亚最优的非自适应控制或成本较高的逐设备重新标定。需要一个定量标准来判断自适应控制的成本是否值得。

Method: 推导元学习的下界，给出自适应增益的下界及其对梯度步数与任务方差的依赖；在量子门校准任务和经典线性二次控制任务上进行验证与对比，验证规律的一般性与可迁移性。

Result: 得到的下界显示自适应增益随梯度步数增长呈指数饱和，且对任务方差线性依赖。量子门校准中，低方差情形收益极低；在极端OOD（训练噪声放大10倍）下，双量子比特门的保真度提升 >40%。经典LQ控制结果与量子场景一致，指示该规律源自通用优化几何。

Conclusion: 给出一个可迁移的自适应控制决策框架，辅助在云量子处理器等场景下判定是否需要逐设备重新校准以降低总成本。

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VPPO 将 PRM 仅用于定位第一个错误的前缀来提高强化学习中的信用分配，解决了将逐步奖励直接用于 RL 时的信号不一致问题，实验在多项推理基准上优于稀疏奖励与先前基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 PRM 在 RL 场景中的逐步分数常嘈杂且难以稳定评估，且将该分数直接作为奖励与 PRM 的检测目标（找出第一个错误步骤）之间存在错配。需一个能够兼顾可验证性与可用作奖励的学习信号的框架。

Method: VPPO 将轨迹划分为可验证的正确前缀和包含错误的后缀，只有前缀获得奖励，错误发生后仅对后缀施加定向惩罚；PRM 仅用于定位错误而非直接作为全局奖励信号，从而提升信用分配的稳定性与可解释性。

Result: 在多项推理基准上，VPPO 相较于稀疏奖励的 RL 和以往的 PRM 指导基线，在 Pass@1 与 Pass@K 指标上均有提升。

Conclusion: 将可验证前缀作为奖励的策略优化框架能提供更清晰的学习信号，改善信用分配并提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一的KV缓存驱逐与查询路由模型，并结合随机化驱逐与学习驱动的路由实现，以在多-LLM服务场景中平衡缓存命中率与负载均衡，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM推理中，KV缓存通过复用KV对来提速，但在受限内存和动态查询到达下，LRU等策略在多工作进程/模型服务场景下难以同时优化缓存命中率与负载平衡；现有方法理论上存在局限。

Method: 给出一个统一的数学模型来刻画缓存驱逐与查询路由的核心权衡，并提出将可证明有竞争性的随机化KV缓存驱逐策略与基于学习的方法相结合的算法，动态适应查询模式的演化。

Result: 理论上揭示现有方法的局限性，提出的算法在4个基准、3种前缀共享设置下实验显示：缓存命中率提升最多约6.92倍，延迟降低约11.96倍，TTFT降低约14.06倍，吞吐量提升约77.4%；代码公开。

Conclusion: 提供了KV缓存在多服务LLM场景中的耦合优化框架，证明随机化 eviction 与学习驱动路由的协同效用；为自适应缓存与路由设计提供理论和实证基础，可推广至相关系统优化。

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SE协方差的若干非对角元素非常接近于零，利用这一性质构造带状矩阵近似，降低逆、行列式的计算成本，从而更高效地近似似然函数。

Method: 从观测中提取近零的离对角项，形成带状近似；利用带状矩阵的逆与行列式可更低成本地计算；在1D SE核情形给出理论分析以保持原协方差结构；与稀疏GP的变分自由能方法进行对比验证。

Result: 理论分析表明在1D情形下可保留原协方差结构，带近似的成本比原始成本显著降低；数值/实验验证其计算效率，且与变分自由能的稀疏GP方法相比具竞争力。

Conclusion: 带状近似为SE核GP提供一种可 principled、计算高效的替代方案，尤其在1D条件下保持结构性并降低成本，未来可扩展至高维或其他核。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

TL;DR: EVEREST：一种基于Transformer的概率罕见事件预测框架，提供校准预测、尾部风险估计与注意力可解释性，参数高效，适用于高风险领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多变量时间序列中，罕见事件预测受严重类别不平衡、长期相关性和分布不确定性影响，需要能校准且尾部敏感的风险估计，并提供可解释性。

Method: 集成四个子头：1) 可学习的注意力瓶颈实现时间动态的软聚合；2) 证据头，用Normal-Inverse-Gamma分布估计混合不确定性；3) 极值头，使用广义帕累托分布建模尾部风险；4) 早事件前兆头用于提前检测；训练时联合优化的复合损失（焦点损失、证据NLL、尾部EVT惩罚），推理阶段仅使用单一分类头，参数约0.81M。

Result: 在十年的太空天气数据上，EVEREST在24/48/72小时的C级耀斑上实现TSS: 0.973/0.970/0.966，达到或超过现有方法；模型紧凑、训练高效，适用于工业监测、天气、卫星诊断等高风险领域。

Conclusion: 局限包括输入长度固定、未纳入图像模态，未来工作拟扩展至流式与多模态预测。

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在微缩量化中，随着区块大小降低，模型输出意外下降，揭示了量化误差的新来源；提出 FP8 无符号 E5M3（UE5M3）作为适合硬件的尺度格式，能在不需要全局尺度操作的情况下达到接近 FP8 E4M3 的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高压缩比的 Microscaling 数据格式用于高效训练与推理，同时保持可控精度损失，需要硬件友好的实现和有效的误差缓解策略。

Method: 通过对多种大语言模型的分布进行实验分析，区分导致异常行为的量化误差来源；建立理论框架，与实际分布和理想分布对比，揭示异常的根源；提出并评估 UE5M3，在 FP4 微缩数据类型中作为尺度格式的替代方案。

Result: 发现异常由窄分布与量化尺度动态范围受限共同驱动；UE5M3 在性能上与传统的 FP8 E4M3 相当，并且省去对权重与激活值的全局尺度操作。

Conclusion: 对量化误差的来源有了更完整的理论与实验证据，提出的 UE5M3 是一种硬件友好的尺度格式，可在 FP4 微缩数据中实现高效且可扩展的训练推理。

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

*Philip Amortila,Audrey Huang,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 feature-dynamics coverage 这一新覆盖概念，用以在最小线性 OPE 设置下对 LSTDQ 的有限样本误差给出界，并在额外假设下与以往覆盖定义统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在仅目标值函数线性可实现的最小设定中，现有覆盖参数定义往往不稳定、解释性差，导致对线性 OPE 的理论界限理解零散且缺乏统一框架。需要一个与经典覆盖概念兼容且在最小假设下有意义的覆盖度量。

Method: 通过将 LSTDQ 置于一种工具变量视角，提出 feature-dynamics coverage；该覆盖度量被解释为“在诱导的特征演化线性系统中”对特征的线性覆盖。给出依赖该覆盖的有限样本误差界，并在需要时结合 Bellman 完备性等假设以对齐到已有覆盖定义。

Result: 给出依赖于 feature-dynamics coverage 的有限样本误差界；在再加入 Bellman 完备性等假设时，可回退并统一现有与覆盖相关的定义，达到对线性 OPE 覆盖的统一理解。

Conclusion: 提供了一个统一的覆盖框架来理解线性 OPE 的覆盖问题，为进一步严格的分布和算法分析奠定基础，并在更广的设定下具备对既有覆盖概念的统一性与可解释性。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Method: 进行基于敏感群体基线发生率的理论分析，探讨 Statistical-Parity 与 Equalized-Odds 在不同基率条件下的兼容性/冲突，给出条件性推导与设计启示。

Result: 揭示基率不平衡会导致两度量的不兼容性；提出在强制使用统计平等之前需评估并可能纠正基率不平衡，并据此为改进现有法律/框架提供方向。

Conclusion: 强调基率平衡在公平性选择中的核心地位，呼吁在实践中进行基线评估并调整评估框架以适应可能的不可兼容性。

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

Motivation: 现有的增强方法多依赖启发式和静态范式；随着训练进展，样本对模型的贡献度呈现动态变化。需要一个能在训练不同阶段自适应生成高质量合成数据的 principled 方案。

Method: 提出 OATS 框架：以有价值的训练样本作为指引信号，动态生成以它们为条件的高质量合成数据。采用扩散模型实现现实感强的时间序列生成，并引入探索-利用机制在效率与效果之间取得平衡。应用于时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）训练中的数据增强。

Conclusion: OATS 提供了一种原型化、可扩展的在线数据增强范式，利用训练阶段的动态样本贡献并结合扩散式数据生成与探索-利用策略，显著提升时间序列基础模型的训练效果。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

Conclusion: 确认自然用户编辑是有效的微调信号，提供一个可行的、对多种反馈类型兼容的学习框架与落地策略，促进个性化的LLM微调。

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

Motivation: 解决 transformer 深层QK/KV激活的冗余带来的计算与能耗问题；利用渐进训练与跨层激活共享提高效率，同时尽量保持性能。

Method: 训练过程中从模型的深端向浅端逐步将解码层切换为激活共享模式，动态增长共享区域；区域长度可随算力预算调整；在LLaMA家族(125M–7B)上应用QK激活共享，并在TinyLLaMA上进行持续预训练以形成注意力共享模型。

Result: 在125M–7B的LLaMA模型上，训练吞吐量提升最多11.1%，推理吞吐量提升最多29%，且损失曲线与基线相近；在持续预训练中，将TinyLLaMA转变为注意力共享模型，平均准确率提升最多10%。

Conclusion: EPAS证明渐进式跨层激活共享可在提高效率的同时维持或提升性能，强调渐进训练在跨层共享中的重要性。

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

### [89] [FloydNet: A Learning Paradigm for Global Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19094)
*Jingcheng Yu,Mingliang Zeng,Qiwei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FloydNet introduces a dynamic-programming–style refinement for graphs by maintaining a global all-pairs relation tensor and learning a DP operator, achieving high expressivity (3-WL/2-FWL) and strong empirical results on CLRS-30, TSP, and BREC, suggesting DP-style refinement as a powerful alternative to message passing for global reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs limited by local message-passing bottlenecks, which hamper global, holistic reasoning. A DP-inspired approach can iteratively refine a global state, enabling a task-specific relational calculus and long-range dependency capture.

Method: Maintain a global all-pairs relation tensor and learn a generalized DP operator that refines it iteratively. The model defines a task-specific relational calculus and analyzes expressivity, showing alignment with the k-FWL hierarchy (3-WL/2-FWL). Empirical validation on algorithmic and graph benchmarks.

Result: The method achieves near-perfect performance on CLRS-30 (>99%), finds exact TSP solutions at rates surpassing strong heuristics, and matches 3-WL on BREC, demonstrating strong global reasoning capabilities beyond standard GNNs.

Conclusion: A learned DP-style refinement offers a principled, scalable alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning, achieving strong expressivity and state-of-the-art/strong performance across challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出 OWLEYE 的零样本图异常检测框架，借助跨域特征对齐、跨域多模式字典学习和截断注意力重构实现对未见图的无标签检测，具备良好泛化与扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要在大规模、跨领域的图数据中开展异常检测，但跨域特征语义差异显著阻碍图基础模型的泛化与持续学习能力，因此提出一个具跨域能力的通用零样本框架。

Method: 1) 跨域特征对齐模块，协调不同域的特征分布并保留域特定语义；2) 多域多模式字典学习，编码共享的结构与属性模式，支持持续学习；3) 截断注意力重构模块，实现无需标注数据的未见图异常检测，具有在上下文中的推理能力。

Conclusion: OWLEYE 为跨域图异常检测提供一个强大的零样本基础，支持无标签的持续学习与推断，并为后续跨域GAD研究提供方向。

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 苹果统一存储架构下的高效推理需求日益增强，但现有工具要么缺乏原生优化，要么仅聚焦文本模型，无法覆盖文本+视觉的多模态工作负载，因此需要面向 Apple 生态的端到端高效方案。

Method: 在 MLX 上原生实现 vllm-mlx 框架；文本模型通过连续分批（batching）提升吞吐，并实现跨模型的对比优势；多模态模型引入基于内容哈希的前缀缓存，利用对输入图片的内容哈希识别重复编码，避免重复Vision编码；在 Apple M4 Max 上评估，比较基线工具并量化文本吞吐、并发吞吐放大、以及多模态的缓存命中带来的加速。

Result: 文本模型吞吐量较 llama.cpp 提升 21%–87%，在 16 请求并发时，聚合吞吐最大提升 4.3x；多模态方面，对重复图片查询实现 28x 加速，降低多模态延迟从 21.7 秒降至不到 1 秒；视频分析（最高 64 帧）实现 24.7x 的缓存加速；在文本模型上实现最高 525 tokens/s。应用实验在 Apple M4 Max 上完成，证实了对消费级硬件的实际效能。

Conclusion: 该实现作为开源项目发布，填补在 Apple 硬件上的高效推理空白，尤其是在文本与多模态工作负载的综合优化方面具有显著潜力，适合面向苹果设备的端到端推理部署及研发。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个将非均匀方差正则化与等距约束结合到自编码器中的新框架，作为PCA的非线性推广，保留有序表示和方差保留以适用于非线性降维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA为线性模型；线性自编码器可在特定正则化下回收PCA分量，但在非线性情境下难以独立捕获剩余方差，需在保持PCA优势的同时处理非线性映射。

Method: 在自编码器中引入非均匀方差正则化与等距约束的联合设计，诱导潜在成分按方差重要性排序并尽量保持输入-潜在空间的距离关系，从而实现PCA的非线性推广。

Result: 该框架自然推广PCA，保留有序表示和方差保持，且在非线性降维任务中有效。

Conclusion: 通过将方差正则化与等距约束相结合，提供一种可在非线性场景下实现PCA核心优势的自编码器框架，具有理论和应用潜力。

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fully automated pipeline turns qualitative SEC risk disclosures into time-bounded supervision, trains a compact LLM to predict risk-materialization probabilities, and achieves frontier-like performance with a single-GPU model, supported by open data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of quantified risk probabilities in SEC disclosures due to missing large-scale supervision linking disclosed risks to outcomes; enable probabilistic analysis using only public, in-domain text.

Method: Automated data generation: extract firm-specific risk queries from Risk Factors; label outcomes by matching to subsequent disclosures; train a compact LLM to estimate probability of materialization within a horizon; evaluation against baselines and frontier models; open-source dataset.

Result: Model outperforms pretrained/heuristic baselines and frontier models (including GPT-5) on probabilistic accuracy/calibration; feasible on single GPU; demonstrates Foresight Learning; open-source evaluation data.

Conclusion: Foresight Learning enables scalable, fully automated domain-specific training from raw chronological text; suggests a general pathway for calibrated, decision-relevant signals from enterprise documents; supports reproducibility and deployment.

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了 SOLD，一种基于强化学习的潜在扩散模型优化框架，用于RNA逆折叠设计，单步噪声优化，融合预训练 RNA-FM 表征，在多结构目标下超越LDM基线和SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNA逆折叠的核心在于实现结构目标（如SS、MFE、LDDT），而非仅仅序列回收。现有方法多聚焦序列回收，对结构一致性等目标的优化能力不足。扩散模型能够捕捉序列-结构的复杂交互，强化学习在面对非可微目标时具有优势。因此，结合两者以实现高效的多目标优化。

Result: 实验结果显示SOLD在所有评估指标上均超越其LDM基线及当前最先进方法，涵盖结构相关指标如SS、MFE、LDDT等，证明其在RNA逆折叠任务上的优越性。

Conclusion: SOLD为RNA逆折叠提供了一个高效且具多目标优化能力的框架，展示了将强化学习与潜在扩散模型结合的潜力，并对生物技术与治疗应用具备重要意义。

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Motivation: 解决传统无监督异常检测与人工分析的规模与对业务需求不匹配的问题；需要可解释且可生产部署的检测方法，且掌握专家知识的高效传递。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）基于LLM对训练数据进行标注，结合领域知识；2）通过LLM驱动的优化生成与迭代改进符号规则；3）用LLMs扩充带业务相关的异常类别以提升可解释性。

Result: 在检测准确性和可解释性方面优于无监督方法；相较于直接使用LLM进行时序异常检测，提供更一致、确定性的结果，低计算延迟和成本，适合生产部署。

Conclusion: 证明LLMs可以在可扩展自动化与专家驱动决策之间架起桥梁，提升供应链运营中的异常检测的可用性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

TL;DR: Efficient QRGMM (E-QRGMM) speeds up quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling by cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation, cutting grid complexity from O(n^1/2) to O(n^1/5) for most quantiles while preserving QRGMM's convergence. It outperforms QRGMM and other deep generative models in distributional accuracy vs. training speed and enables bootstrap-based covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification is essential for high-stakes decision-making; existing methods (conformal prediction, classical bootstrap) struggle to condition on covariates effectively at the distributional level.

Method: Incorporates cubic Hermite interpolation into the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) framework and introduces gradient estimation to accelerate training. The paper proves that convergence rate is preserved and grid complexity is reduced for the majority of quantile levels. Empirical comparisons show improved trade-offs between distributional accuracy and training speed against QRGMM and advanced deep generative models. Bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands is enabled.

Result: Achieves a superior distributional accuracy–speed trade-off relative to QRGMM and other deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Demonstrates practical covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification via bootstrap-based CIs for arbitrary estimands.

Conclusion: E-QRGMM offers a practically efficient, theoretically sound framework for covariate-conditioned uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference, combining interpolation-based acceleration with preserving convergence and enabling bootstrap-based CIs.

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

*Anower Zihad,Felix Owino,Haibo Yang,Ming Tang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A beyond-backprop split learning method that decouples client/server training using a local auxiliary classifier at the split point, achieving comparable accuracy to standard split learning while halving communication and reducing peak memory use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce communication overhead and memory usage in split learning by avoiding end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split.

Method: Client augments its network with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide local error signals; server trains on the transmitted activations using the true loss; both sides rely on local losses instead of propagated gradients, removing backward gradient transmission.

Result: Performance on par with standard split learning on CIFAR-10/100; communicates about 50% less (activations/gradients) and reduces peak memory by up to 58%.

Conclusion: Beyond-backprop splits can retain performance while significantly reducing communication and memory, offering a viable alternative to end-to-end backpropagation in distributed split learning; potential applicability to other datasets and deeper architectures, with possible limitations related to local signal quality.

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

TL;DR: MEA: 显式建模跨头交互的多头注意力，通过 Head-level Linear Composition 与 Head-level Group Normalization 实现跨头通信与训练稳定性；并通过降低头数并使用低秩虚拟头重建实现 KV-cache 压缩，显著降低内存占用同时保持大多数组任务性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Transformer 注意力中头之间潜在的交互不足，提升注意力性能与训练稳定性，同时探索参数和内存效率的提升。

Method: 引入 Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) 模块，对键和值向量在不同头之间进行可学习的线性组合，从而实现丰富的跨头信息交流；加入头级 Group Normalization，用于对重新组合后的头进行统计对齐；在头数受限时，通过低秩“虚拟头”重建实现 KV-cache 的压缩，理论上可将 KV 缓存内存降低约 50%。

Result: 在预训练阶段表现出显著鲁棒性，允许使用更大学习率以加速收敛，最终降低验证损失并提升在多任务上的性能；对知识密集型与科学推理任务几乎无性能损失；在 Olympiad 级数学基准上仅有 3.59% 的准确率下降。

Conclusion: MEA 提供一个简单且有效的跨头交互机制，提升鲁棒性与收敛效率；并通过低秩虚拟头实现 KV-cache 的显著压缩，具有良好的实用性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

*Chen Chen,Lai Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-LN Transformer 的深层训练难题通过引入 Highway 风格的连接得到缓解，Keel 使 Post-LN 在极深层（>1000 层）实现稳定训练，并在困惑度与深度扩展性上优于 Pre-LN，显示 Post-LN + Highway 可成为深度可扩展 LLM 的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 的规模扩展遇到瓶颈：扩大模型规模收益递减，扩展上下文长度并不能提升本质表达能力。深度扩展具有理论上的表达力优势，但现有 Transformer 架构在极深深度下训练不稳定，Post-LN 的不稳定性源于 ResNet 风格残差通路导致梯度消失。

Method: 在 Post-LN Transformer 中用 Highway 风格的连接替换残差路径，以保留通过残差分支的梯度，防止信号在自顶向底传递时逐层衰减。Keel 不需要特殊初始化或复杂优化技巧即可在极深深度下稳定训练（超过 1000 层），训练过程鲁棒。

Result: Keel 能在深度超过 1000 层时稳定训练，且在 perplexity 与深度扩展特性方面明显优于 Pre-LN。该结果表明 Post-LN 与 Highway 连接的组合可作为深度可扩展 LLM 的简单而有效基础。

Conclusion: Post-LN 搭配 Highway 连接可为构建极深的 LLM 提供稳定、简单的基础，有望开启未来无限深度架构的研究与应用。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中难以获得精确距离，转而使用相对距离比较（四元组查询）来实现聚类；查询成本高且可能带噪声，需在有限查询预算内获得可用聚类解；并希望将该思路与现代学习模型/人类反馈结合。

Method: 设计随机化算法，使用四元组查询输出一个包含O(k polylog n)个中心的集合及一个将输入项映射到中心的分配，使聚类代价不超过最优k-聚类的常数因子；在一般度量空间的查询复杂度为O(n k polylog n)，在有界 Doubling 维度的度量上降低到O((n+k^2) polylog n)，并在Doubling维度下提供1+ε近似的进一步提升，且保持相同的对数级别查询复杂度；框架展示如何将带噪声/低成本的查询整合到可扩展聚类算法。

Result: 给出了在R-model下的聚类算法及其理论保证：对一般度量空间，达到常数近似，查询复杂度为O(n k polylog n)；对有界 Doubling维度的度量，改进为O((n+k^2) polylog n)，并在同一维度下实现1+ε近似；并给出一个框架，说明在噪声和低成本的四元组查询环境中仍可实现高效聚类。

Conclusion: 提出了一种系统性框架，将噪声的相对距离查询（四元组）融入k-聚类，适用于模型或人类反馈驱动的应用场景，兼具理论近似性和可扩展性，具有将学习模型/人类偏好融入无监督聚类的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBRL在从原始观测学习世界模型时对结构相似场景的泛化能力不足，易被纹理、颜色等无关变化干扰。受人类将感官输入分割为离散事件以指导决策的启发，提出无需手工标签的事件感知表征以提升鲁棒性与样本效率。

Conclusion: EAWM为通用框架，降低对人工标签的依赖，具备广泛适用性与推广性，适用于多种世界模型结构；后续可扩展至更多任务与数据集以进一步提升泛化与鲁棒性。

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks. Our code is released at https://github.com/MarquisDarwin/EAWM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRUE uses reconstructions from two intermediate layers to measure uncertainty, improving OOD detection in glaucoma tasks across domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for high-stakes DL. Conventional single-reconstruction proxies suffer information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Reconstruct inputs from two intermediate layers and compute discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score; evaluate in an OOD detection setting with glaucoma as the in-distribution task across multiple domain-shift datasets.

Result: DRUE achieves superior AUC and AUPR on multiple OOD datasets, demonstrating robustness under distribution shift.

Conclusion: Presents a principled and effective framework to enhance model reliability in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 提出 GraphSB 的结构平衡框架，通过结构增强与关系扩散在采样前对不平衡图结构进行平衡，再与 GNN 结合提升分类精度；作为插件式模块可提升现有方法约4.57%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不平衡节点分类在图学习中面临的根本原因不仅来自样本层面的数量不平衡，还来自不平衡的图结构导致多数类主导与少数类被同化。现有以数据层和算法层的对策未直接处理不平衡的图结构问题，需在结构层面进行干预以改善 minority-context 的传播与边界近邻的难样本挖掘。

Method: GraphSB 采用两阶段结构优化：Structure Enhancement（通过双视角分析挖掘接近决策边界的难样本，并通过自适应增强提高少数类的连通性）和 Relation Diffusion（对增强后的少数样本上下文进行传播，同时捕捉更高阶的结构依赖），在与 GNN 结合前对图的结构分布进行平衡。

Result: 大量实验显示 GraphSB 相较于先进方法显著提升性能；且 Structural Balance 可以作为简单的插件模块嵌入现有方法，平均提升准确率约4.57%。

Conclusion: 将结构层面的不平衡作为前置处理，辅以二阶段的结构优化与关系扩散，可显著提升 GNN 在不平衡图上的学习效果，并具备良好的可插拔性与适用性。

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

### [108] [Selective Steering: Norm-Preserving Control Through Discriminative Layer Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375)
*Quy-Anh Dang,Chris Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective Steering introduces a norm-preserving rotation and discriminative layer selection to steer LLM activations, achieving 5.5x higher attack success, zero perplexity violations, and near-full capability retention across nine models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods suffer from norm drift (activation addition), binary control (ablation), or norm-non-preserving rotations (Angular Steering) that cause distribution shift and instability, especially in smaller LLMs. A principled, norm-preserving, targeted method is needed.

Method: 1) Develop a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation of activations in a 2D subspace; 2) Apply steering only on layers where feature directions are opposite in class alignment, enabling discriminative, selective intervention.

Result: Empirical evaluation across nine models shows ~5.5x higher attack success rate than prior methods, with zero perplexity violations and ~100% capability retention on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Selective Steering provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification, improving attack efficacy while preserving model quality.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Conclusion: 将域敏感性分析引入参数层面的正则化，提供对模型学习过程的更细粒度控制，从而提升对未见领域的鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的车辆路径问题具有强序列依赖、时间窗、补给/充电停靠、边缘成本不对称等约束，且规模庞大。现有神经方法多忽略序列与边信息，难以处理RWVRP的复杂性与规模，亟需具备边信息感知且可缩放的模型。

Method: 提出SEAFormer，一种 transformer 架构，包含两大创新：1) Clustered Proximity Attention（CPA）：通过局部性聚类实现注意力复杂度从O(n^2)降低到O(n)，同时保留全局视角；2) 轻量级边缘感知模块：通过残差融合捕获点对特征，使模型能够有效利用边信息并加速收敛。

Result: 在四种RWVRP变体与多种规模上进行广泛实验，SEAFormer在多数场景超越最先进方法，且是第一种能够有效解决1,000+节点RWVRP的神经方法，同时在经典VRP上也表现出色。

Conclusion: SEAFormer证明了在RWVRP中引入边信息与可扩展注意力的必要性，兼具对研究基准和现实应用的适用性，展示了边缘特征与高效全局建模的复合优势。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

*Finn Rietz,Pedro Zuidberg dos Martires,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Policy Composition (APC)，通过对多条数据驱动的正则化流（NF）先验进行自适应组合，在强化学习中处理示范数据的不完美性与错位性，同时提升探索效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 示范数据在实践中常常稀疏、次优或与目标任务错位，直接强制遵循会降低性能，需开发能自适应评估先验在目标任务中的适用性并用于探索的方法。

Method: 提出分层模型APC，通过自适应地将多条NF先验进行组合；不强制严格遵循先验，而是估计其对目标任务的适用性，并在探索阶段加以利用；同时对有用的先验进行 refinement，对误配的先验进行回避，形成对下游奖励的最优优化路径。

Result: 在多样基准上，APC在示范对齐时加速学习，在严重错位下保持鲁棒，并能利用次优示范作为探索的引导，同时避免过于严格遵循次优示范导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: APC实现对示范先验的稳健、可适应整合，提升在对齐/错位/次优情形下的学习效率和鲁棒性，兼具加强探索和避免过度依赖的特点。

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

*Victoria Catterall,Cise Midoglu,Stephen Lynch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepHit-based time-to-injury survival modelling on SoccerMon with SHAP explanations; achieves 0.762 concordance index and interpretable, individualized risk, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of static pre-season, binary injury predictions; need dynamic time-to-event predictions for actionable injury prevention in football.

Method: Preprocess SoccerMon data with cleaning and feature engineering; apply three imputation strategies; baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) with grid search; DeepHit with an MLP backbone; evaluate with chronological and leave-one-player-out validation; apply SHAP for interpretability.

Result: Concordance index 0.762 for DeepHit, outperforming baselines; provides time-varying, individualized risk estimates; SHAP identifies clinically relevant predictors consistent with known risk factors.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of survival modelling for football injury forecasting using DeepHit; potential to deliver accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.

Abstract: Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.

### [114] [LLM-VA: Resolving the Jailbreak-Overrefusal Trade-off via Vector Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19487)
*Haonan Zhang,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Kexin Chen,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LLM-VA，通过对齐回答向量与安全判断向量，消解答复意愿与安全评估之间的独立性，从而提高安全性同时维持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量驱动的安全控制在抑制 jailbreak 与避免对 benign 查询过度拒绝之间存在根本权衡，原因在于模型将回答决策向量和安全判断向量视为近似正交的独立过程。

Method: 提出LLM-VA：在不微调/不改变架构的前提下，通过在每层识别回答向量与安全向量，选择与安全相关的层，使用最小范数权重修改实现闭式更新将回答向量与安全向量对齐，使回答意愿条件化于安全评估。具体包括：在每层用SVM识别向量、定位安全相关层、通过迭代的最小范数权重修改实现对齐。

Result: 在12个LLM上实验，LLM-VA使F1比最佳基线提高11.45%，并保持95.92%的实用性，同时可自动适应各模型的安全偏置，无需人工调参。

Conclusion: 通过将回答向量与安全向量对齐，将安全评估对回答决策的因果依赖性引入到模型推理中，避免了传统向量驱动方法的权衡，提供一种无微调、无架构改动的安全对齐策略。

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

TL;DR: GenCP 将耦合多物理建模转化为概率建模问题，通过在概率演化空间进行生成建模与迭代耦合，并利用算子分裂理论实现误差控制的条件到联合采样，从解耦数据训练到耦合推断。

Conclusion: GenCP 提供一种新颖且具理论误差控制的耦合多物理仿真生成框架，能够在解耦数据条件下学习并推断耦合物理，具有广泛潜在应用。

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

### [116] [Scale-Consistent State-Space Dynamics via Fractal of Stationary Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19551)
*Geunhyeok Yu,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST) 来强制状态空间模型潜在动态的尺度一致性，使中间表示具有自相似的分形结构，从而实现可预测的收敛和基于内在特征质量的早停排序，并在 ImageNet-100 上验证其自适应效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度模型在迭代过程中的中间表示缺乏结构性保证，导致早停和自适应计算难以建立理论或稳定性。

Method: 提出对尺度一致性的结构性要求并引入 FROST 作为分形诱导偏置，确保表示流形自相似；给出几何分析以证明收敛性与收缩性，并提出基于内在特征质量的停机排序。

Result: 在迭代过程中的收敛性和稳定性得到证明；停机可以基于内在特征质量进行排序；在 ImageNet-100 上的控制实验验证了尺度一致性和由对齐的潜在几何驱动的自适应效率。

Conclusion: 通过 FROST 实现的尺度一致性为迭代状态空间模型提供了可解释且高效的自适应计算框架。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

*Dayoung Kang,JongWon Kim,Jiho Park,Keonseock Lee,Ji-Woong Choi,Jinhyun So*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AROMMA learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures using a foundation model for molecules and an attention-based mixer, with knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to align odor descriptors; it delivers state-of-the-art AUROC improvements (up to 19.1%) in both single-molecule and molecule-pair benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented, hindering learning of generalizable odor representations. Existing work treats single molecules and mixtures separately, limiting cross-domain transfer and unified representations.

Method: Encode each molecule with a chemical foundation model; compose two-molecule mixtures with an attention-based aggregator that is permutation-invariant and models asymmetric molecular interactions; align odor descriptor sets across datasets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a robust unified embedding framework capable of handling both molecular and mixture data, advancing generalizable odor representations and opening avenues for cross-domain transfer.

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGRC通过分歧导向的分层课程构建，在无标注数据的前提下从原子知识到推理链学习，利用教师推理分歧进行自诊断生成原子问答对，进而提供原子课程和可核验的CoT课程以提升小模模型在专业领域的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无标注数据下将LLMs适配到专业领域面临的挑战：常见蒸馏方法易落入粗粒度模仿，且教师推理并非完美无瑕，因此需要一个可靠的课程设计来缓解教师自带缺陷的传授风险。

Method: 提出分歧引导推理课程（DGRC）：当学生与教师给出冲突结果时，教师进行诊断分析，针对推理路径中的分歧提出原子级查询并自我回答，生成高可信的原子问答对；据此构建原子课程以修正学生知识空缺，并作为筛选教师原推理链的事实性标准，形成可验证的CoT课程，指导学生将原子知识整合入完整推理。

Result: 在医学与法律领域对不同规模的学生模型进行了实验，1.5B学生模型在医学领域相对强基线提升7.76%。

Conclusion: DGRC为无标注场景下提供从原子知识到完整推理路径的自适应课程，缓解教师推理瑕疵对学生的负面传递，提升小模型在专业领域的适应性与性能。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

*Jiří Němeček,Mark Kozdoba,Illia Kryvoviaz,Tomáš Pevný,Jakub Mareček*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个基于混合整数优化的框架，用于训练兼具交叉群体公平性与内在可解释性的分类器，证明MSD与SPSF在检测最不公平子群方面等价，并在实验中提升偏见发现能力，输出可解释且可控的高性能模型，适用于受监管行业。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域需要公平与透明的模型，且法规如EU AI Act对偏见提出要求但 lacks 明确定义，需以交叉群体视角统一偏见度量并实现可解释性与可控性。

Method: 采用混合整数优化（MIO）训练具有交叉群体公平性约束且可解释的分类器；证明两种交叉群体公平性度量（MSD与SPSF）的等价性；通过实验验证在发现偏见方面的提升，并训练出界定交叉群体偏差的高性能可解释模型。

Result: 得到的模型在保护变量的交叉子群体上实现偏差界限，低于设定阈值，同时具备良好可解释性与高预测性能。

Conclusion: 提供一个鲁棒且可解释的交叉群体公平性训练框架，帮助受监管行业实现AI合规，并可扩展到其他领域。

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对 InfoNCE 的几何机制进行测度论分析，揭示在单峰与多峰两种潜在优化景观下的不同能量地形：单峰为严格凸性、Gibbs 平衡唯一；多峰则存在持久的对称负散度项，导致屏障驱动的共适应与模态间之间隙成为结构性必需；分析焦点从点对点判别转向总体分布几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越传统的对比学习中的对齐-均匀性分解，建立一个固定嵌入流形上的表示测度演化框架，通过大批量极限下的一致性（值与梯度）将随机目标与确定性能量景观联系起来，揭示 InfoNCE 的几何机制并解释分布不对齐的根源。

Method: 提出一个测度论框架，将学习视为在固定嵌入流形上的表示测度演化；在大批量极限下证明值与梯度的一致性，使随机对目标转化为明确的能量景观；在单峰与多峰设定下分析能量地形，区分严格凸性与对称负散度项的影响，以及 kernel sharpening 后仍存在的对称项对共适应的推动作用。

Result: 揭示两种几何策略：1) 单峰情形下的能量景观严格凸，存在唯一的 Gibbs 平衡，熵仅作为折中项，说明“均匀性”是对齐区域内的受限扩张；2) 多峰对称目标包含持久的负对称散度项，即使核锐化后仍在，促成屏障驱动的群体共适应，形成模态间的结构性间隙而非初始化导致。

Conclusion: 分析焦点从点对点辨别转向对整体分布几何的理解，提供诊断与控制分布错位的原理性框架。

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

TL;DR: SOOPER combines optimistic exploration with pessimistic fallback to a conservative prior in safe RL, providing safety guarantees and regret bounds, backed by experiments on benchmarks and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe exploration in online RL is essential when interacting with the real world; leveraging suboptimal but conservative priors from offline data/simulators can improve safety and sample efficiency.

Method: Use probabilistic dynamics models to perform optimistic exploration while falling back to a conservative policy prior when risk is detected; integrate safety constraints to guarantee safe learning.

Result: The approach guarantees safety throughout learning and provides a bound on cumulative regret; empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art safe RL methods and scales to real-world hardware.

Conclusion: SOOPER is a scalable, safe, and effective RL method with theoretical guarantees that hold in practice as demonstrated by experiments.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为R^3的强化学习机制，通过跨上下文回放、内在自省与结构性熵排序奖励三条路径，改善大推理模型的稳定性与效率，在数学领域任务上实现SOTA并减少推理令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于群组的策略优化在同批次内高质量样本产生的优势差距支撑下易塌陷，训练脆弱且效率低下，尤其在困难任务中组内优势下降时表现不稳。

Method: 在三条方向上实施R^3：1) 跨上下文回放（cross-context Replay）通过回忆同一查询的历史轨迹中有价值的样本来维持组内优势；2) 内在自省（in-context Self-Reflection）让模型利用过去失败来精炼输出；3) 结构性熵排序奖励（structural entropy Ranking reward）对截断或失败样本进行相对奖励排序，基于 token 级熵模式同时捕捉局部探索与全局稳定。

Result: 在Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上实现，基于DeepscaleR-40k的数学领域数据，若干数学基准上达到SOTA，显著提升且在推理令牌数量上更少。

Conclusion: R^3通过结合跨上下文记忆、内省式纠错与熵为导向的相对奖励，有效提升LRMs在复杂推理任务中的稳定性与效率，且具备良好的迁移潜力，预计将对大规模推理模型的训练和评估带来广泛影响，代码与模型将公开。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

TL;DR: ProToken 提出基于 token 级溯源的 Provenance 方法，用梯度相关性加权和层级选择实现对联邦LLM在自回归文本生成过程中的客户端归属。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习环境下部署的LLMs 难以对具体生成回应的贡献客户端进行准确归属，影响调试、公平激励、信任验证。

Method: 利用两点策略：1) Transformer 的后层包含更多任务信号，选择有限层以降低计算成本；2) 基于梯度相关性权重筛选，聚焦对 token 生成直接影响的神经元，并在每个 token 上进行 provenance。对 Gemma、Llama、Qwen、SmolLM 四种架构、四个领域进行16种配置评估。

Result: 在评估中达到约 98% 的平均 attribution accuracy，且在扩大客户端数量的情况下仍保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为联邦学习环境中的 LLM 提供可行且隐私友好的 token 级归因方案，提升调试、追责与公平奖励的可行性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Motivation: 海上风电场数据稀缺，需在新场站点数据不足的情况下获得可靠功率预测，以支撑电网稳定性、备用容量管理与能源交易，并降低数据采集成本。

Method: 将功率输出按气象协变量进行聚类，训练一组专家模型（每个专注于一种天气模式）的集成；对新站点，通过选取或组合相关专家实现迁移；模型具备对季节性与气象变动的内置校准，减少对整整一年的本地观测数据需求。

Result: 在8座海上风电场上进行评估，在仅需不到5个月的站点数据条件下实现跨域预测，达到MAE约3.52%。

Conclusion: 该气候感知的迁移学习方法可降低数据需求，适用于早期风资源评估，能加速项目开发并降低开发风险，具有在海上风电领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

Motivation: 在3-bit以下的权重量化中，残差矩阵在低秩近似下面临较大挑战，且现有无微调 PTQ 在 sub-3-bit 区间容易显著降 accuracy，需要昂贵的微调来竞争性地表现。

Method: 提出 LoPRo：通过块级置换和 Walsh-Hadamard 变换对列向量进行旋转，使重要列块对齐；显式保留最显著列块的量化精度，提升低秩量化的保真度。同时引入基于秩-1 草图的混合精度快速低秩分解（R1SVD），以降低量化代价并保持高效推理。该方法为无微调的 PTQ。

Result: 在 2-bit 与 3-bit 量化下，LoPRo 优于现有无微调 PTQ 方法，且性能接近微调基线；在 LLaMA-2/3 系列上达到最先进的量化精度并实现最高约 4× 的速度提升。
在 MoE 模型 Mixtral-8x7B 上，完成量化仅需 2.5 小时，困惑度降低 0.4 坍，准确率提升 8%，相较于其他低秩量化方法，在更低的秩下实现更高的准确性与推理效率。

Conclusion: LoPRo 提供了一种高效、无微调的 PTQ 方案，通过对残差矩阵的结构性改造与基于秩-1 草图的快速低秩分解，实现低位量化下的高精度与低成本，适用于大规模语言模型和混合专家模型，并显著提升了现有无微调 PTQ 的性能边界。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

TL;DR: 提出 ODEdit，一种面向跨模态提示的 OOD 泛化编辑框架，通过不变学习和总变差正则稳健化编辑轨迹，提升多模态知识编辑的可靠性、局部性和普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模态编辑多依赖参数-输出映射，导致在多模态因果推理中出现欠拟合/过拟合；需要区分语义转变与事实转变以实现鲁棒的跨模态编辑。

Method: 引入 ODEdit 框架，作为可插拔的方法，优化三元 OOD 风险；引入编辑轨迹不变量学习，将总变差罚项纳入目标以稳定跨环境的编辑轨迹。

Result: 理论分析证明方法的鲁棒性和稳定性，广泛实验表明在多模态编辑任务上的性能优于基线（提升编辑可靠性、局部性和普遍性）。

Conclusion: ODEdit 可在不改变模型结构的前提下实现跨模态知识编辑的鲁棒化，适用于更广泛的跨模态应用场景；未来工作可扩展到更复杂环境和评估体系。

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将分布性核引入分裂层次聚类，替代集合导向的二分评估，提出总相似度目标TSC并给出下界；实验表明在人工数据与 Spatial Transcriptomics 上，树状图更符合生物区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于目标的分裂层次聚类（DHC）存在三项不良性质：不必要的分裂、将相似簇聚成同一子集、ground-truth 对应性差，根源在于集合导向的二分评估准则。

Method: 通过引入分布性核替代集合导向准则，提出分布导向的目标TSC，旨在最大化所有簇之间的总体相似度；给出理论分析，证明所得到的树状图对TSC具有下界；并在人工数据与 Spatial Transcriptomics 数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 方法得到的树状图在 Spatial Transcriptomics 数据集上与生物区域保持一致，而其他方法未能达到这一一致性；理论分析给出TSC的下界，实验结果证实了分布导向DHC的有效性。

Conclusion: 分布导向的DHC通过替代集合导向评估、引入TSC目标及其下界，提升了树状图的结构性质与ground-truth 对应性，具备在生物信息等领域的应用潜力与推广价值。

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

TL;DR: 提出一个 Instant Retrospect Action (IRA) 框架，通过 RDE、GAG、IPU 等机制提升在线值基 RL 的学习效率和策略更新速度，并缓解过估偏差，在八个 MuJoCo 任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于值的在线 RL 在探索效率、策略利用和更新时序方面的不足，导致学习慢、更新迟滞和过估偏差问题。

Method: 引入 Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) 以学习邻近状态-动作对的判别性表示；通过回溯历史动作实现 Greedy Action Guidance (GAG) 以对策略进行显式约束；提出 Instant Policy Update (IPU) 机制以提升策略更新频率；利用 k 最近邻的动作价值估计；并在早期训练阶段引入保守性以缓解过估偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明 IRA 在八个 MuJoCo 连续控制任务上显著提升了在线 RL 的学习效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: IRA 将更快的策略利用和更稳健的价值估计结合起来，通过 RDE、GAG、IPU 等设计实现对在线值基 RL 的性能提升和稳定性改善。

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验表明，重尾梯度噪声比方差有界的噪声更贴近深度学习训练过程，但现有关于重尾噪声下的泛化界限研究较少，因此需要一个系统的框架来推导泛化界限。

Method: 引入截断策略以获得基于算法稳定性的泛化误差界限，假设梯度噪声的 p 阶中心矩有界，p∈(1,2]；在此框架下对剪裁 SGD、归一化 SGD及其小批量、动量等变体给出稳定性与泛化分析。

Result: 提出适用于重尾噪声的通用泛化界限框架；在该框架下给出若干常见随机优化算法的稳定性与泛化分析结论，明确噪声重尾对泛化界的影响，以及参数/算法设置对界限的影响。

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了重尾噪声情形下的泛化理论，提供了截断+稳定性的方法论，可用于分析和设计对重尾噪声鲁棒的随机优化算法。

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

Motivation: 在广义下游任务分布中，单纯零样本求解不可行；目标任务可能未知或超出预训练分布，需要高效的多轮探索与自我设定目标来提高泛化与适应性。

Conclusion: 证明了无监督元学习框架下，结合对抗性目标生成与情境学习器的预训练能在广义任务分布中实现快速适应和泛化，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphDLG 在 Federated Graph Learning 场景中从共享梯度中同时恢复图结构和节点特征，核心在于先实现结构恢复再利用闭式递推规则重构特征；通过引入随机图或客户端训练图作为辅助，可显著提升恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私保护下的联邦图学习存在从梯度还原原始图数据的风险，尤其是在图结构与节点特征高度耦合的 GNN 场景中，尚缺乏系统性分析。

Method: 理论分析显示，一旦恢复出图结构，节点特征可通过一个闭式递推规则直接推导；基于此提出 GraphDLG，通过利用随机图或客户端本地训练图作为辅助来增强结构重建与特征重建的性能。

Result: 实验证明 GraphDLG 相比现有方法在节点特征重建的均方误差（MSE）方面降低超过 5.46%，在图结构重建的 AUC 指标上提升超过 25.04%。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了在 FGL 场景下的深层梯度泄露风险，尤其是结构与特征之间的耦合为攻击提供了新的突破口；同时也提示需要针对图数据的防护策略以抵御此类 DLG 攻击。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

### [132] [Knowledge-Aware Evolution for Streaming Federated Continual Learning with Category Overlap and without Task Identifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19788)
*Sixing Tan,Xianmin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedKACE tackles streaming federated continual learning with overlapping classes and no task IDs by (i) adaptive inference switching between local and global models for personalization/generalization, (ii) adaptive gradient-balanced replay to fuse new and old knowledge under overlapping classes, and (iii) kernel spectral boundary buffer to preserve high-information samples for cross-round retention; experiments and regret analysis show effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses non-stationary data in federated settings where data arrive as streams, classes may overlap between old and new data, and no explicit task identifiers exist. Existing batch-based FCL methods are ill-suited for such streaming scenarios, leading to indistinguishability of old vs new knowledge and uncertain sample provenance. A streaming FCL framework with sustained cross-round inference is needed.

Method: Introduce FedKACE with three components: (1) adaptive inference model switching to allow unidirectional shift from local to global model, balancing personalization and generalization; (2) adaptive gradient-balanced replay to reconcile learning of new knowledge with retention of old knowledge under overlapping-class conditions; (3) kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance to preserve informative and high-boundary samples for robust cross-round knowledge retention.

Result: Empirical results across multiple scenarios and regret analyses demonstrate that FedKACE effectively preserves prior knowledge while integrating new information under streaming, disjoint/overlapping category conditions and absent task IDs.

Conclusion: The paper defines a streaming FCL setting and proposes FedKACE as a practical, effective solution that enhances knowledge retention and generalization in the presence of overlapping classes and missing task identifiers.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

*Padmaksha Roy,Lamine Mili,Almuatazbellah Boker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个多方向元学习框架用于类可泛化的异常检测。通过两级优化：内部学习正常数据的表示/流形，外部用少量异常样本进行元调优以最大化正常与异常之间的 softmax 边界，实现对未知异常的更好泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异常检测中，目标是用大量正常数据和少量标记异常数据来识别完全未知的异常类型（OOD）。异常数据稀缺且标注成本高，因此需要一种能够泛化到未见异常的学习策略。

Method: 采用多方向元学习框架：内部阶段学习正常数据的表示与流形（ID/正样本的结构信息），外部阶段以少量异常样本进行元调优，目标是在决策边界上提高正常与异常的软最大概率边界（分类边界校准）。通过在以正常为主、少量异常的若干“episode”上循环实现两级优化，并通过多方向训练增强泛化能力。

Result: 作者声称该多方向元学习框架能够提升对未见异常类别的泛化能力，即对未知OOD异常有更强的识别能力。

Conclusion: 两级优化结合多方向训练为类可泛化的异常检测提供了有效策略，可在缺少异常标注的情形下提升对未见异常的检测性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公开文本资源的逐步枯竭，缺乏 ground-truth 标签时提升大模型的需求上升；同时强模型往往存在严重的校准问题，因此需要一个在无标签条件下也能保证性能提升的理论与实用框架。

Method: 当强模型与参考模型之间存在非互校准关系时，存在实现严格改进的可能性。将此条件与经济学中的套利/无交易理论联系起来，提出基于Bregman投影的高效无标签后处理算法，能够在最坏情形下降低损失且不需要标签。

Result: 在代表性的大规模语言模型上进行实验，方法显著降低适当损失与校准误差，且性能与监督基线相当甚至接近。

Conclusion: 提供一个通用、理论支撑的无标签后处理框架，增强模型标定与损失性能；未来工作可扩展到更多任务、数据集及多模型协作场景，并对不同损失函数的鲁棒性进行系统分析。

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Transformer with temporal modeling predicts wall shear stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA geometry, using augmented learning with steady-state CFD data; achieves high fidelity (SSIM ≈ 0.98, relative L2 ≈ 2.8%), enabling real-time surrogate CFD for intracranial aneurysm biomechanics and potential extensions to other cardiovascular scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD-based WSS extraction is accurate but computationally intensive and low-throughput, hindering clinical translation; a real-time geometry-to-biomechanics surrogate is needed to support trials and clinical decision-making.

Method: Graph Transformer model encoding IA surface meshes with temporal information, trained on large pulsatile CFD data; predicts WSS across the cardiac cycle; employs augmentation by injecting abundant steady-state CFD data to improve performance when pulsatile data are limited; includes ablation studies and SOTA benchmarking.

Result: SSIM up to 0.981; maximum-based relative L2 error ≈ 2.8%; augmentation with steady-state CFD data substantially improves performance with small pulsatile CFD samples; demonstrates real-time computability of temporal cardiovascular fluid mechanics from geometry.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a proof of concept that temporal sequences of cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time from geometric mesh using deep learning, with robustness to limited pulsatile data, and broad applicability to other cardiovascular scenarios.

Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  foundation models 在持续学习中的遗忘问题突出；强制性奖励信号稀缺；演示学习是主流但通常通过离策略的监督微调；需要一个能够从演示中进行在策略学习且保持旧能力的方法。

Method: 使用自我蒸馏微调：以演示为条件的模型作为教师，让模型基于自身的输出生成在策略的训练信号；通过上下文中的演示信息实现自回路蒸馏，使模型在保持旧技能的同时学习新技能；在技能学习和知识获取任务上进行评估。

Result: 相比SFT，SDFT在新任务准确度上更高、遗忘显著减少；在顺序学习中，单一模型能够随着时间积累多项技能且不出现性能回归，使在策略蒸馏成为从演示中进行持续学习的实际路径。

Conclusion: 在演示驱动的持续学习场景下，基于在策略自我蒸馏的方法具有实际可行性，SDFT提供了一有效的替代离策略微调的方法以从演示中持续学习。

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Motivated by the growing use of RAG systems across diverse languages, we explore several strategies to generalize the Provence framework-which first integrated efficient zero-cost context pruning directly into the re-ranking model-beyond English. Across four multilingual question answering benchmarks, we show how XProvence can prune RAG contexts with minimal-to-no performance degradation and outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: JIMA能够有效整合多粒度偏好信息和领域知识，提升复合物品推荐的准确性与可解释性，适用于复杂应用场景。

Abstract: With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, recommender systems have been increasingly used across a vast variety of platforms to efficiently and effectively match users with items. As application contexts become more diverse and complex, there is a growing need for more sophisticated recommendation techniques. One example is the composite item (for example, fashion outfit) recommendation where multiple levels of user preference information might be available and relevant. In this study, we propose JIMA, a joint interaction modeling approach that uses a single model to take advantage of all data from different levels of granularity and incorporate interactions to learn the complex relationships among lower-order (atomic item) and higher-order (composite item) user preferences as well as domain expertise (e.g., on the stylistic fit). We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method and compare it with advanced baselines through multiple simulation studies as well as with real data in both offline and online settings. The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出 HELM 框架，对 LLMs 驱动的推荐系统进行五维度的人本评估，并在电影、书籍、餐厅领域进行大规模专家评审，揭示传统准确性指标难以捕捉的质量要素；GPT-4 在解释质量与互动自然性方面领先，但存在显著的流行度偏差；框架及开源工具可用于推动人本评估实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多聚焦于传统准确性指标，忽视用户体验的多维度因素（如解释、互动、信任、公平性等），导致评估结果与真实使用体验不一致。需要系统化的人本化评估框架以支撑 LL M 驱动推荐的设计与比较。

Method: 建立五维度评估框架：Intent Alignment、Explanation Quality、Interaction Naturalness、Trust & Transparency、Fairness & Diversity。选取三种 LL M 基模型（GPT-4、LLaMA-3.1、P5），覆盖电影、书籍、餐厅三个领域；由12名领域专家对847个推荐场景进行评估；并与传统指标进行比较，分析差异与偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明 HELM 可揭示传统指标难以捕捉的质量维度。GPT-4 在解释质量（4.21/5.0）和互动自然度（4.35/5.0）方面领先，但存在显著的流行度偏差（Gini 系数 0.73，高于协同过滤 0.58）。同时发布开源工具包以促进人本评估实践。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation systems has introduced unprecedented capabilities for natural language understanding, explanation generation, and conversational interactions. However, existing evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on traditional accuracy metrics, failing to capture the multifaceted human-centered qualities that determine the real-world user experience. We introduce \framework{} (\textbf{H}uman-centered \textbf{E}valuation for \textbf{L}LM-powered reco\textbf{M}menders), a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM-powered recommender systems across five human-centered dimensions: \textit{Intent Alignment}, \textit{Explanation Quality}, \textit{Interaction Naturalness}, \textit{Trust \& Transparency}, and \textit{Fairness \& Diversity}. Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58). We release \framework{} as an open-source toolkit to advance human-centered evaluation practices in the recommender systems community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态推荐中的模态特征易受噪声与不确定性影响（如图像模糊、视觉差异、文本模糊），且现有方法未充分利用用户/物品间的相似模式来精炼表示与不确定性估计。

Method: 提出SPUMR框架，构建模态相似性图和协同相似性图以从内容和行为两个角度 refin representations；不确定性感知的偏好聚合模块自适应融合多模态特征，给更可靠的模态分配更大权重。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SPUMR相较于现有方法具有显著提升。

Conclusion: SPUMR通过显式建模与缓解模态不确定性并利用相似性模式，提升多模态推荐的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Recommendation (MMR) systems are crucial for modern platforms but are often hampered by inherent noise and uncertainty in modal features, such as blurry images, diverse visual appearances, or ambiguous text. Existing methods often overlook this modality-specific uncertainty, leading to ineffective feature fusion. Furthermore, they fail to leverage rich similarity patterns among users and items to refine representations and their corresponding uncertainty estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPUMR achieves significant improvements over existing leading methods.

### [143] [Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System: A Dual-Physics Approach for Personalized Nutrition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19244)
*Chayan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A physics-informed neuro-symbolic recommender system that enforces nutritional constraints via a dual-layer architecture: knowledge graph alignment, differentiable thermodynamic regularization, and a physics-based inference optimizer (simulated annealing + elastic quantity) to generate nutritionally compliant grocery bundles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems optimize engagement/purchase likelihood but ignore rigid physiological constraints; there is a need to incorporate nutritional plausibility to ensure daily energy and macronutrient targets can be met.

Method: A two-layer framework: (1) semantic knowledge graph linking products to authoritative nutritional data using sentence-level encoders; (2) during training, an implicit physics regularizer applying a differentiable thermodynamic loss to embed nutritional plausibility; (3) during inference, an explicit physics optimizer using simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to form discrete grocery bundles that satisfy protein and caloric targets.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual framework with architectural contributions but does not report empirical results; the effectiveness is asserted in reducing nutritional infeasibility rather than demonstrated.

Conclusion: The approach integrates nutritional science into recommender systems, enforcing physiological feasibility in both training and inference; it promises healthier, constraint-satisfying recommendations but requires robust nutrition data, careful calibration of the physics components, and empirical validation.

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce recommender systems primarily optimize for user engagement and purchase likelihood, often neglecting the rigid physiological constraints required for human health. Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets.

*Zijie Lei,Tao Feng,Zhigang Hua,Yan Xie,Guanyu Lin,Shuang Yang,Ge Liu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: UniRec: a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation that handles text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes using a triplet (name, type, value) and a hierarchical Q-Former to model nested user histories, achieving up to 15% gains over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world recommendation signals are heterogeneous across modalities and include intra-modality ambiguities, such as different numeric attributes (price, rating, time) with distinct semantics, coupled with nested user histories (sequences of items with multiple attributes). There is a need to bridge schema and raw inputs for effective LLM understanding.

Method: 1) Modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across text, images, categorical, and numerical attributes. 2) A triplet representation (attribute name, type, value) to separate schema from input data and preserve semantics. 3) A hierarchical Q-Former to capture the nested structure of user interactions and their layered organization.

Result: Empirical results on multiple real-world benchmarks show UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component (modality-specific encoders, triplet schema, hierarchical Q-Former).

Conclusion: UniRec provides a coherent, scalable framework to unify heterogeneous multimodal signals for LLM-based recommendation, addressing inter- and intra-modality heterogeneity and nested histories, with substantial performance gains and insights from ablations.

Abstract: Large language models have recently shown promise for multimodal recommendation, particularly with text and image inputs. Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component.

TL;DR: MDGR是一种基于掩码扩散的生成式推荐框架，通过并行扩散生成SID，解决自回归解码的全局依赖、属性排序不一致、推理效率低下等问题，并在多数据集与实际平台上实现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐多沿用语言模型的自回归解码，但存在三大局限：1) 难以在多维SID特征的不同位置之间捕捉全局依赖；2) 固定解码路径假设同一用户对属性的关注顺序一致；3) 推理阶段效率低，难以满足实时性需求。

Method: 在三方面改造GR流程：1) 采用并行代码本（parallel codebook），为扩散式GR提供结构基础；2) 训练阶段在时间维度和样本维度上自适应构建掩码监督信号；3) 推理阶段提出基于暖启动的两阶段并行解码策略，实现高效的SID生成。

Result: 在多份公开与工业规模数据集上，MDGR对10个最先进基线提升高达10.78%；在大型在线广告平台上线部署后，带来1.20%的收入提升；代码将在论文被接受后开源。

Conclusion: MDGR通过从码本、训练与推理三方面的结构性改造，显著提升生成式推荐的性能与效率，具备实际落地价值。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In the era of explosive growth in academic literature, the burden of literature review on scholars are increasing. Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出 Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking (LURE-RAG)，在黑盒检索器上增设 LambdaMART 再排序器，通过基于列表的损失和 LLM 效用信号直接优化检索文档顺序，以提升 RAG 的下游效用；在两个数据集上接近最先进的稠密基线（约 97–98%），且其稠密变体 UR-RAG 相较现有基线提升最多 3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的相关性检索与下游任务的实际效用常不对齐，且现有的效用驱动检索方法成本高、缺乏列表级排序损失，文档顺序对生成结果影响显著，因此需要一个高效、以效用为导向的再排序机制。

Method: 在黑盒检索器之上增加一个高效的 LambdaMART 再排序器，并用基于 LLM 的效用信号指导训练，采用列表排序损失直接优化检索文档的排序；稠密变体称为 UR-RAG，使用密集向量表示来进一步提升性能。

Result: 实验表明：LURE-RAG 在两组标准数据集上达到约 97–98% 的 SOTA 稠密基线性能，训练与推理效率较高；UR-RAG 在密集变体上相比现有最佳基线有显著提升，最高可达 3%。

Conclusion: LURE-RAG 提供一种资源友好、直接优化检索文档顺序的解决方案，能够与任何黑盒检索器结合，并通过对文档排序的列表级损失实现更符合下游任务的效用提升。

Abstract: Most conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on relevance-based retrieval, which often misaligns with utility -- that is, whether the retrieved passages actually improve the quality of the generated text specific to a downstream task such as question answering or query-based summarization. The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLM驱动的语义检索在数据发现方面相较于传统关键词检索表现出显著优势：返回更多结果，对地点、拼写错误、模糊/复杂查询更鲁棒，但并非完全替代关键词检索，二者互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升数据发现的准确性与覆盖率，克服关键词检索在自然语言查询、拼写错误和上下文理解方面的局限性。

Method: 基于真实世界搜索行为，选取CDRC日志中最常用的131个检索词，比较面向UKRI数据服务的定制语义检索系统与CDRC关键词检索；采用描述性统计、质性检查和定量相似性度量（精确重叠、Jaccard相似度、基于BERT嵌入的余弦相似度）评价结果的数量、重叠、排序与相关性。

Result: 语义检索通常返回比关键词检索更多的结果，对地点相关、拼写错误、模糊或复杂查询表现尤为突出；尽管不能覆盖所有关键词检索结果，但返回的数据集在语义上高度相似（高余弦相似度，尽管精确重叠较低）；两工具的排名差异明显，体现不同的排序策略；案例研究显示对拼写错误鲁棒、能正确解读地理与上下文相关性，并支持自然语言查询，是关键词检索难以解决的。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的语义检索对数据发现具有实质性改进，应与关键词检索互补使用，而非完全替代。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of a large language model (LLM) based semantic search tool relative to a traditional keyword-based search for data discovery. Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve. Overall, the findings suggest that LLM driven semantic search offers a substantial improvement for data discovery, complementing rather than fully replacing traditional keyword-based approaches.

Motivation: 现有的互动推荐系统易陷入内容同质化与滤泡效应，强调短期偏好且忽视用户兴趣的长期演化；尽管强化学习可优化长期收益，但在现实中存在稀疏、长尾的用户-物品交互和有限的语义规划能力问题。

Method: 提出一个层次化框架：高层基于大语言模型的规划者选择语义多样的内容类别；低层RL策略在选定的语义空间内实现个性化的物品推荐。通过缩小行动空间、提高规划效率并降低冗余内容暴露来实现。

Result: 在真实数据集上展开的大量实验表明，LERL 相较于现有最先进基线显著提升长期用户满意度。

Conclusion: 证明将大语言模型的语义规划能力与强化学习的微观适应性结合的可行性，且有望缓解内容同质化与过度曝光问题；代码公开可获取。

Abstract: Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code3-18D3/.

TL;DR: 提出 DIGER，使语义 ID (SID) 可微分，通过引入 Gumbel 噪声促进早期代码本探索，缓解 codebook 崩溃；设计两种不确定性衰减策略在探索与收敛之间平衡；在多组公开数据集上实现对可生成推荐的索引与推荐目标对齐的稳定提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将 SID 视为静态、预定义的离散代码，SID 学习主要关注内容重构而非推荐准确性，导致索引损失与推荐损失难以协同更新；早期的确定性分配导致 codebook 崩溃、代码利用率低且优化不稳。需使索引可微以便梯度直接影响 SID 学习，同时避免崩溃。

Method: 在 SID 上引入 Gumbel 噪声以促进早期探索，避免崩溃；设计两种不确定性衰减策略逐步减小噪声，实现从探索到对学习到的 SID 的利用的平滑转变；使 SID 可被端到端微分优化，使推荐梯度直接影响 SID 学习。

Result: 在多组公开数据集上进行广泛实验，DIGER 展现出对可生成推荐的 SID 的端到端可微分架构能带来稳定的性能提升，证明了通过可微分的 SID 来对齐索引和推荐目标的可行性。

Conclusion: 可微分语义索引是有意义且有前景的研究方向，DIGER 作为首步工作证明了在避免代码本崩溃的同时实现端到端优化的可行性，为后续在生成式推荐中的编码表学习和索引设计提供新方向。

Abstract: Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.
  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction.
