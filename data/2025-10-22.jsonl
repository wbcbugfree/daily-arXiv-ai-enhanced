While promising, transformers' computational cost\nscales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number\nof candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand\ncandidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the\nsignificant performance improvements.\n  We introduce \\textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this\ntrade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces\ncomputational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings\" enable\npre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate\ninteractions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set\nsize. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \\textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the\ncomplexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to\nlinear ($O(N)$).\n  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity\nwith state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\\times$ inference speedup on\nlarge candidate sets or long sequence lengths.

A dual calibration\nstrategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in\nputatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic\nregression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively\nincorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further\ninvestigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration\nmetrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal\ncoverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones\nshow that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,\nand competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and\nfocal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty\nquantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc\nsolution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability\nalignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making."}

Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,\naccess remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static\ndirectories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and\ngeographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague\nnutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as\ntime, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems\noptimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of\nfood-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified\navailability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most\nvulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital\nilliteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we\nintroduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for\nreal-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three\ninnovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,\ncommunity platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of\nfood resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on\ncurated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional\ncorrectness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval\npolicies to evolving user needs.

We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs.

When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error."}

Our approach substantially extends tool-use\nchains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and\n90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to\nout-of-distribution datasets.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest.

We trace this failure to semantic\nclustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few\nfull-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a\nback-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost\nthrough translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust\nacross different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable\nto new languages.

While a growing body of theoretical work has\nemerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning\nlarge language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise\ncomparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result\nshows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,\nthe bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,\nwhich was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we\nestablish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}}\n\\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size.

To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground\ntruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as\nexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to\ntest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary\nsearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer\nand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and\ncooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can\nsignificantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various\nbenchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL\ntraining setups.

We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of\ncounting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into\nrule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be\nextracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they\nrepresent."}

While\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the\nnuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward\nhacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust\nreinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable\npersonalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a\nPersonalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional\nscores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a\nCritique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs\nbased on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a\nrigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms\nstandard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an\naverage 11\\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses\nthe performance of GPT-4.1.

When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}
