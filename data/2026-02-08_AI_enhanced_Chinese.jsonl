In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models.

As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks.

Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as \"Positive Character\" and \"Number of Task Steps\", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries.

We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning.

To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation.

In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of $9.2$ million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems.

However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed.

As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.\n  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.\n  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning.

Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\"\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\"\u5230\"\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d88\u51cf\"\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u6d88\u51cf\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UQ\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5355\u8f6e\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027UQ\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6db5\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53UQ\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u8ff0\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u9690\u542b\u5730\u5c06UQ\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d88\u51cf\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u8c03\u884c\u52a8\u7684\"\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\"\u5efa\u6a21\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6d88\u51cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53UQ\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d88\u51cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53UQ\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5f00\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u5355\u591a\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u534f\u4f5c-\u84b8\u998f-\u518d\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.0%\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u540e\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u534714.9%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u52a0\u8f7d\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u534f\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\uff1a\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u5355\u591a\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5404\u81ea\u4ece\u534f\u4f5c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u84b8\u998f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u4e3b\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u548c15\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u5355\u4e2a\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53478.0%\uff0c\u4ee5\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b2) \u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4f7f\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u534714.9%\uff1b3) \u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u8fdb\u5316AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b5) \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5355\u591a\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u534f\u540c\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance.

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.\n  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.\n  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.\n  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u79fb\u9664\uff08ADR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u788e\u7247\u4ea4\u4f1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u71c3\u6599\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Iridium 33\u788e\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u73af\u5883\u65e5\u76ca\u62e5\u6324\uff0cADR\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u536b\u661f\u56e0\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u6001ADR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4f1a\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u52a0\u6cb9\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u62ec\u71c3\u6599\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u78b0\u649e\u533a\u89c4\u907f\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Iridium 33\u788e\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u9053\u6784\u578b\u4e0e\u788e\u7247\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RL\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u788e\u7247ADR\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A Comparative Study on Bluesky", "comment": null, "summary": "As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.\n  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones.

However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph.

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount.

Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations.

Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(TPC)\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u6b21\u8f68\u8ff9\u8026\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001ImageNet\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b(\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001flow matching\u3001rectified flow)\u867d\u7136\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5e38\u5c06\u5404\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5e73\u6ed1\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u91cd\u6784\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u6216\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "TPC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684velocity\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u8026\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u6216ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u81ea\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e8c\u6b21\u8f68\u8ff9\u8026\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cbflow matching\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1TPC\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0eImageNet\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684FID\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u4ee3SOTA\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u4ee5\u53carectified flow\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "TPC\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a9\u7801PPO\u3001\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u63a9\u7801PPO\u4ee5\u53ca\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u79fb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5728\u71c3\u6599\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u957f\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u52a0\u6ce8\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u788e\u7247\u573a\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9300\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u63a9\u7801PPO\u3001\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u63a9\u7801PPO\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e09\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u6807\u79f0\u3001\u71c3\u6599\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u79f0PPO\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u4f46\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6025\u5267\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316PPO\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u635f\u5931\u6807\u79f0\u6027\u80fd\uff1bMCTS\u56e0\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8017\u65f6\u9ad8\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5f39\u6027ADR\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It is thanks to recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search-with the emergence of highly efficient algorithms such as the inverted index-based Seismic and the graph-based Hnsw-that retrieval with sparse representations became viable in practice. In this work, we scrutinize the efficiency of sparse retrieval algorithms and focus particularly on the size of a data structure that is common to all algorithmic flavors and that constitutes a substantial fraction of the overall index size: the forward index. In particular, we seek compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint of the forward index without compromising search quality or inner product computation latency. In our examination with various integer compression techniques, we report that StreamVByte achieves the best trade-off between memory footprint, retrieval accuracy, and latency. We then improve StreamVByte by introducing DotVByte, a new algorithm tailored to inner product computation.

As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAPO\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u70b9\u66ff\u4ee3DPO\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u60b2\u89c2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u5dee\u8ddd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "DPO\u7b49\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u53d8\u4f53\u867d\u907f\u514d\u5931\u914d\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u70b9\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u65bd\u52a0\u5fae\u5c0f\u534a\u5f84\u5185\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u60b2\u89c2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u903b\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cGAPO\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Christensen"], "title": "GAMMS: Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator", "comment": null, "summary": "As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio.

Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates.

A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations.

Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters.

While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing.

Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment.

We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers.

While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \\modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model.

While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations.

They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data.

To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the \"Manifold Dilution\" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by \"Orthogonal Interference,\" where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not \"unlearn\" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude.

To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HugRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57faRAG\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5339\u914d\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5b64\u7acb\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57faRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u8282\u70b9\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6216\u865a\u5047\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u5355\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b64\u7acb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u5757\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "HugRAG\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u56fe\u57faRAG\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHugRAG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u57faRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($\u0393$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $\u0393$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79d1\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08$\u0393$\uff09\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u56e0\u7d20\u5e93\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bd5\u9519\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u96c6\u4f53\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bd5\u9519\u3002\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u6574\u65e0\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5806\u780c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5021\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6c\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08$\u0393$\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5185\u5728\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u9884\u7b97\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u7d20\u5f52\u56e0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u9a71\u52a8\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027MAS\u56e0\u7d20\u5e93\uff0c\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7ea7\u9884\u8bbe\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8f6c\u5411\u4e25\u8c28\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\"\u96c6\u4f53\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\"\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the \"boiling frog\" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPrune-Tune Loop (PTL)\u6e10\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u526a\u679d-\u5fae\u8c03\u5faa\u73af\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u8fd1\u534a\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u9aa4\u964d\u4e14\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u5e73\u8861\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6PTL\uff0c\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6267\u884c\u526a\u679d\u540e\u7acb\u5373\u5fae\u8c03\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\"\u6e29\u6c34\u716e\u9752\u86d9\"\u6548\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "result": "PTL\u53ef\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u539f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u517c\u5bb9\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u526a\u679d\u3001\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "PTL\u662f\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u538b\u7f29\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average.

Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model.

In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \\emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\\%, 11.25\\%, and 9.55\\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \\textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations.

While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u89e3\u91caCypher\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc790\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u65f6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u867d\u80fd grounding \u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u638c\u63e1\u4e13\u4e1a\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u89e3\u91caCypher\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u5730\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4fbf\u6377\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5f71\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u4e8690\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5e76\u5728Hyena\u548cMaRDI\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM-Cypher\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning.

Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning.

Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity.

We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design.

However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes.

However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs.

Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \\textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness.

This is a pre-MIT Press publication version", "summary": "Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems.

However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high.

To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes.

Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence.

This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4f4e\u4e8e10B\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u773c\u79d1\u60a3\u8005\u54a8\u8be2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GPT-4-Turbo\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u773c\u79d1\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u5206\u8bca\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u56db\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u91cf<10B\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Meerkat-7B\u3001BioMistral-7B\u3001OpenBioLLM-8B\u3001MedLLaMA3-v20\uff09\uff0c\u4ee4\u5176\u5206\u522b\u56de\u7b54180\u4e2a\u773c\u79d1\u60a3\u8005\u54a8\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5171\u751f\u62102160\u6761\u56de\u590d\uff09\u3002\u7531\u4e09\u540d\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u8d44\u7684\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u548cGPT-4-Turbo\u4f7f\u7528S.C.O.R.E.\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5171\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c5\u5206\u5236\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Spearman\u7b49\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u3001Kendall tau\u548c\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "Meerkat-7B\u7efc\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u9ad8\u7ea7\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u4f4f\u9662\u533b\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u5747\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a3.44\u30014.08\u30014.18\uff09\u3002MedLLaMA3-v20\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff0c25.5%\u7684\u56de\u590d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bef\u5bfc\u5185\u5bb9\u3002GPT-4-Turbo\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5448\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08Spearman rho=0.80\uff0cKendall tau=0.67\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7ea7\u987e\u95ee\u8bc4\u5206\u66f4\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5b88\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u773c\u79d1\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5ba1\u67e5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs.

While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators.

Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights.

We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model.

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively.

Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks.

Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9886\u57df\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5171\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4ecd\u662f\u5176\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8bc6\u522b\u5171\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5341\u9879\u5fb7\u82f1\u548c\u82f1\u6c49\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9886\u57df\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aPEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.\n  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.\n  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora.

This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMUTATE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9690\u968f\u673a\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u56de\u7b54\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u9650\u4e8ei.i.d.\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9690\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u91cf\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9690\u968f\u673a\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6MUTATE\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u8bba\u8bc1\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cMUTATE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7a81\u53d8\u7d2f\u79ef\u673a\u5236\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u653e\u7535\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0cMUTATE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent.

We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting.

One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance.

However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps).

This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types.

Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes.

A Reliability Metric for XAI", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective.

Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs).

In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning.

Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.\n  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs.

These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.\n  The pattern generalizes beyond games.

Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faKV-CoRE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSVD\u7684KV-cache\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u57df\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684KV-cache\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u4f1a\u9971\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86KV-cache\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "KV-CoRE\uff08KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation\uff09\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\u5728Frobenius\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u7684\u7279\u6027\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff08Normalized Effective Rank\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u82f1\u6587\u57df\u548c\u5341\u516d\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aKV-cache\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u5448\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21KV-cache\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates whether multilingual LLMs exhibit consistent value judgments across languages or show language-specific variations.

Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%.

However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods.

In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.", "code_url": "https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB", "code_stars": 4, "code_last_update": "2026-02-06", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u5757(DSB)\u53ca\u5176KV\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u4f4d\u7f6e\u88ab\u8feb\u8fc7\u65e9\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b80\u5355\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u5757(DSB)\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u5757\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1DSB Cache\u4e13\u7528KV\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDSB\u4e0eDSB Cache\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u8bed\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3DSB\u548cDSB Cache\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals.

A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain.

In this work, we present \\textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \\textsc{Low}/\\textsc{Mid}/\\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets.

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies.

Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFlash\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5757\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u8349\u7a3f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u635f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc76\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6bd4EAGLE-3\u63d0\u901f\u9ad8\u8fbe2.5\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u7a3f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ca\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFlash\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5757\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u8349\u7a3ftoken\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8349\u7a3f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc76\u500d\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5EAGLE-3\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad82.5\u500d\u7684\u989d\u5916\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DFlash\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u7a3f\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff08crosstalk\uff09\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u964d\u7ef4\u5668\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6545\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u7535\u673a\u590d\u5408\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u63a5\u6545\u969c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5148\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u964d\u7ef4\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6545\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b\u673a\u578b\u548c\u673a\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u548c\u7535\u673a\u590d\u5408\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b\u5185\u5916\u5708\u6545\u969c\u3001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u4e2d\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5355\u901a\u9053\u4e0e\u591a\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u964d\u7ef4\u5668\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u6240\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families.

This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack.

Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeta-Autointerp\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u8bfb\u590d\u6742\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5168\u9762\u5916\u4ea4\u6e38\u620f\uff09\u4e2dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d90%\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u88ab\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5047\u8bbe\u4f7f\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534714.2%\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u591a\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u65e0\u5b9e\u9645\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5256\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u6d8c\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5168\u9762\u5916\u4ea4\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u4e0eLLM\u6458\u8981\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMeta-Autointerp\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06SAE\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u3001\u9000\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u7b49\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc190%\u7684SAE\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u591a\u6570SAE\u7279\u5f81\u548cLLM\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u65e0\u76ca\uff1b\u90e8\u5206SAE\u884d\u751f\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u5347+14.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "SAE\u4e0eLLM\u6458\u8981\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0cMeta-Autointerp\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fddLLM\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation.

Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons.

In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u7f20\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u5b50\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89e3\u7f20\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u9f13\u52b1\u56e0\u5b50\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u9690\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u89e3\u7f20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u5b50\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u6291\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u7f20\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89e3\u7f20\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings.

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements.

However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling.

Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches.

Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to \"stitch\" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution.

In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa DLM-Scope\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5728 DLM \u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u63d2\u5165 SAE \u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e3a DLM \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u6b63\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a DLM \u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DLM-Scope\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e SAE \u7684 DLM \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3 Top-K SAE \u5e76\u63d2\u5165 DLM \u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09SAE \u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u63d0\u53d6 DLM \u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0e LLM \u4e0d\u540c\uff0cDLM \u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u63d2\u5165 SAE \u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff1b3\uff09SAE \u7279\u5f81\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e LLM \u7684 steering \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4\uff09SAE \u53ef\u4e3a DLM \u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b5\uff09SAE \u7279\u5f81\u5728 DLM \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a DLM \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06 SAE \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e DLM \u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%).

We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation.

However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model.

In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a novel federated learning framework that combines homomorphic encryption with property-inference meta-classifiers to simultaneously achieve secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience, demonstrating 90-94% attack detection accuracy with minimal utility loss.", "motivation": "Federated Learning's distributed nature creates privacy/security vulnerabilities including inference attacks and Byzantine behaviors.

A Study in Offline Goal-Conditioned RL", "comment": "27 pages, 19 figures", "summary": "Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity.

However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \\emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance.

We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph.

Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \\emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency.

Theoretical analysis of behavioral alignment evaluation", "summary": "Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.\n  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.\n  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.\n  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment.

While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\\log(t)}$, where $\u03b2_p = \\frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \\in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p/2}}$, $p \\in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively.

However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k).

Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6027 regime\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u65ad\u7a0b\u5e8f\u867d\u5e73\u6ed1\u6536\u655b\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8bca\u65ad\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5185\u5728\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u9000\u5316\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4e14\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u79d1\u5b66\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6839\u672c\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u65ad\u5931\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027 regime\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6f14\u793a\u5728\u6b64 regime \u4e0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9000\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u6240\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6b64 regime \u4e0b\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u975e\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u800c\u653e\u5927\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0e\u62df\u5408\u4f18\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u4fdd\u6301\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6b63\u5e38\uff1b\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5e76\u975e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u80fd\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5fc5\u987b\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u7cb9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684POMDP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPBP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4f20\u7edfPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePBP\u5728\u89c6\u89c9POMDP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\uff0c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "PBP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0ePOMDP\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6210\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\u6570K\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6362\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u5efa\u7acb\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u53d8\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e38\u6570\u500d\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u6210\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u672a\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\u6570K\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6b64\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6362\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u63a8\u5bfc\u671f\u671b\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u7684sup-inf\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u7ecf\u9a8cGLR\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e3a\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d8\u4f53", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u8fbe\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u805a\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u5e38\u6570\u500d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63a8\u65ad\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7edf\u4e00"}}

In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFedRandom\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc733%\uff08\u534a\u6570\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572890%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u56e0\u627f\u62c5\u6210\u672c\u800c\u671f\u671b\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u642d\u4fbf\u8f66\u8005\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u53c2\u4e0e\u610f\u613f\u3002", "method": "FedRandom\u5c06\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001MNIST\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cFMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0cFedRandom\u5728\u534a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FedRandom\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Develops a new non-Statistical Queries framework to analyze limitations of standard vanilla SGD for single-index and multi-index models, addressing the tenuous connection between SQ framework and SGD's actual noise characteristics.", "motivation": "The SQ framework's adversarial noise assumptions poorly reflect real SGD noise, and existing SGD analyses often require artificial modifications (sphere constraints, tiny learning rates), creating a gap between theoretical limits and practical performance.", "method": "Proposes a novel non-SQ analytical framework specifically designed for vanilla SGD, focusing on single-index/multi-index models where target functions depend on low-dimensional input projections.", "result": "Framework successfully applies to broad settings and architectures, including potentially deep neural networks, providing more accurate theoretical limits for standard SGD without unrealistic algorithmic modifications.", "conclusion": "Establishes a more faithful methodology for studying SGD limitations that better reflects practical gradient descent behavior, enabling rigorous analysis of vanilla SGD across diverse model architectures."}}

The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection.

We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice.

Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR).

In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions.

However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks.

However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining \"good samples\" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data.

Submitted to Mathematical Programming", "summary": "Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u8a00\u65b9\u5411(SOD)\u9003\u79bb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u5373\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9003\u79bb\u865a\u5047\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\u56e0\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u5730\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u800c\u89c4\u907f\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u8a00\u65b9\u5411(SOD)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u81f3\u539f\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u70b9\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u4e25\u683c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660eSOD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9003\u79bb\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u3001\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u5f20\u91cf\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9003\u79bb\u865a\u5047\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5177\u6709nontrivial\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval (\"The Bitter Lesson\" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u5bf9\u79f0/\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9010\u6b21\u820d\u5165\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f4d\u5bbd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPTQ\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u9762\u4e34\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6311\u6218\u3002\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316(PTQ)\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cf\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u820d\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u4fdd\u6301PTQ\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5931\u914d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9010\u6b21\u820d\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u5bbd\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8ePTQ\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4e3aLLM\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/szegedai/world-model-verification", "summary": "Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces adversarial sequence generation to verify the soundness of generative sequence models in chess, finding that no models are fully sound but some training techniques improve soundness significantly.", "motivation": "Generative sequence models trained on samples may not capture the complete \"world model\"; there's a gap between theoretical soundness guarantees and practical verification, especially in complex domains.", "method": "Proposes adversarial sequence generation that creates valid sequences to probe models into making invalid predictions; applies this to chess models trained with different recipes; investigates board state probes.", "result": "All evaluated chess models are unsound; some training techniques and dataset choices substantially improve soundness; board state probes show no causal role in next-token prediction for most models.", "conclusion": "Adversarial verification reveals universal unsoundness in sequence models, highlights the importance of training methodology, and suggests board state representations don't causally influence predictions."}}

We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data.

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$\u03c7^2$ regularizer. This additional $\u03c7^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.", "code_url": "https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKim", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d(PMD)\u7684\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5PMD-mean\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5747\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u8fd1\u4f3clog-partition\u9879\u5e76\u5728log-policy\u7a7a\u95f4\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5e26\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KL-\u03c7\u00b2\u6df7\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u03c7\u00b2\u9879\u5728\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u5927\u5e45\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "PMD\u867d\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eKimi\u7b49\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u60f3PMD\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728LLM\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6709\u9650rollout\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6784\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b9e\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPMD-mean\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a(1)\u7528\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u8fd1\u4f3clog-partition\u9879\uff1b(2)\u5728log-policy\u7a7a\u95f4\u6267\u884c\u56de\u5f52\uff1b(3)\u7406\u8bba\u523b\u753b\u5176\u603b\u4f53\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660ePMD-mean\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5e26\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408KL-\u03c7\u00b2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u03c7\u00b2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u6982\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u9884\u671f\u5956\u52b1\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9PMD-mean\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u03c7\u00b2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u8bba\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8PMD\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We propose \"Diamond Maps\", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods.

However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging.

These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793aGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7Reynolds\u7b97\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u64e6\u9664\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u6210\u5206\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bfb\u51fa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u7559\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ec5\u66ff\u6362\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\u5373\u53ef\u7a81\u7834WL-hard\u56fe\u5bf9\u5206\u79bb\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c06GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5c40\u9650\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bfb\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5185\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bfb\u51fa\uff08\u5982sum/mean pooling\uff09\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b8c\u5168\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\u672c\u8eab\u4e5f\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bfb\u51fa\u5747\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u901a\u8fc7Reynolds\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7f6e\u6362\u7fa4\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fdb\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u9053\u5e76\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u88ab\u5e73\u5747\u64cd\u4f5c\u62b9\u9664\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4ec5\u66ff\u6362\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\u5c31\u80fd\u4f7f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bbWL-hard\u56fe\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bfb\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662fGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4e14\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bfb\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u662fGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u6c60\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u6784\u9020\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bfb\u51fa\u5c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347GNN\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u957f\u671f\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002"}}

Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schr\u00f6dinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u975e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u7684\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u79bb\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning.

In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dSoftmax\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SSA\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08OSA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u5c06\u659c\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e9\u9635\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u826f\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684Softmax\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SSA\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u79e9\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u75c5\u6001\u7b49\u56fa\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08OSA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u503c\u6784\u6210\u7684\u659c\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e9\u9635\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u503c\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u7279\u6b8a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "OSA\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u63d0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5730\u786e\u4fdd\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u826f\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5/\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684Transformer\u66f4\u6613\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "OSA\u6210\u529f\u89c4\u907f\u4e86SSA\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u5373\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework.

Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions.
