Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision.

Yet, despite its empirical success, they are primarily built on a \"single-turn\" formulation where each query-target pair is treated as an independent data point. This paradigm leads to computational inefficiency when scaling, as it requires a separate forward pass for each pair and overlooks potential contextual relationships between multiple queries that can relate to the same context. In this work, we introduce Multi-Turn Contrastive Learning (MuCo), a dialogue-inspired framework that revisits this process. MuCo leverages the conversational nature of MLLMs to process multiple, related query-target pairs associated with a single image within a single forward pass. This allows us to extract a set of multiple query and target embeddings simultaneously, conditioned on a shared context representation, amplifying the effective batch size and overall training efficiency. Experiments exhibit MuCo with a newly curated 5M multimodal multi-turn dataset (M3T), which yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB and M-BEIR benchmarks, while markedly enhancing both training efficiency and representation coherence across modalities.

However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation.

Works such as Wukong, HiFormer, and DHEN have attempted to increase the complexity of interaction structures in ranking models and validate scaling laws between performance and parameters/FLOPs by stacking multiple layers. However, their experimental scale remains relatively limited. Our previous work introduced the TokenMixer architecture, an efficient variant of the standard Transformer where the self-attention mechanism is replaced by a simple reshape operation, and the feed-forward network is adapted to a pertoken FFN. The effectiveness of this architecture was demonstrated in the ranking stage by the model presented in the RankMixer paper. However, this foundational TokenMixer architecture itself has several design limitations. In this paper, we propose TokenMixer-Large, which systematically addresses these core issues: sub-optimal residual design, insufficient gradient updates in deep models, incomplete MoE sparsification, and limited exploration of scalability. By leveraging a mixing-and-reverting operation, inter-layer residuals, the auxiliary loss and a novel Sparse-Pertoken MoE architecture, TokenMixer-Large successfully scales its parameters to 7-billion and 15-billion on online traffic and offline experiments, respectively.

Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression.

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context.

Existing methods generally adopted a two-stage \"retrieval-refinement\" strategy to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, they still suffer from (i) noisy retrieval due to skewed data distribution and (ii) lack of semantic understanding in refinement. While semantic enhancement, e.g., LLMs modeling or semantic embeddings, offers potential solutions to these two challenges, these approaches face impractical inference costs or insufficient representation granularity. Obsorbing multi-granularity and lightness merits of semantic identity (SID), we propose a novel paradigm that equips retrieval and refinement in Lifelong User Modeling with SEmantic IDs (R2LED) to address these issues. First, we introduce a Multi-route Mixed Retrieval for the retrieval stage. On the one hand, it captures users' interests from various granularities by several parallel recall routes. On the other hand, a mixed retrieval mechanism is proposed to efficiently retrieve candidates from both collaborative and semantic views, reducing noise. Then, for refinement, we design a Bi-level Fusion Refinement, including a target-aware cross-attention for route-level fusion and a gate mechanism for SID-level fusion. It can bridge the gap between semantic and collaborative spaces, exerting the merits of SID. The comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in both performance and efficiency.

To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory.

Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance.

Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations. Finally, we review evaluation benchmarks and metrics for assessing memory utility, and outline various open challenges and future directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This survey addresses AI's paradigm shift toward real-world utility by proposing a unified framework for foundation agent memory, analyzing its implementation across topologies and learning policies, reviewing evaluation metrics, and outlining future challenges.", "motivation": "AI research is transitioning from model-centric benchmarking to solving real-world utility gaps in long-horizon, dynamic environments where agents face context explosion and require continuous information management across extended interactions.", "method": "Presents a three-dimensional taxonomy of memory: 1) Substrate (internal/external storage), 2) Cognitive mechanism (episodic/semantic/sensory/working/procedural), 3) Subject (agent/user-centric).

We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_\u03b8(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_\u03c6(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling.

Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness.

This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner.

To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path.

Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives.

However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling.

For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves.

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCOVER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7559\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a drafting\uff0c\u6d88\u9664 flip-flop \u632f\u8361\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u6b65\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u591a\u4e2a token \u6765\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u64a4\u9500\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0 flip-flop \u632f\u8361\uff08token \u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u63a9\u7801\u540e\u53c8\u6062\u590d\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6d88\u8017\u4fee\u8ba2\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u53d8\u6162", "method": "COVER\u901a\u8fc7KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8986\u76d6\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u56fe\uff1a\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u79cd\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5176\u7f13\u5b58\u7684KV\u72b6\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u5176\u4ed6\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u95ed\u5f0f\u5bf9\u89d2\u4fee\u6b63\u9632\u6b62\u79cd\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u79cd\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u6570\u91cf", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCOVER\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "COVER\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u53ef\u64a4\u9500\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684flip-flop\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a0\u901f"}}

We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures.

We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families.

Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims.

In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($\u03bc$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the \"optimal\" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $\u03bc$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($\u03bc$P) in pretraining.

Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning.

In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes VowelPrompt, a framework that enhances LLM-based speech emotion recognition by incorporating interpretable, vowel-level prosodic features (pitch, energy, duration) converted into natural language descriptions, trained via SFT+RLVR (GRPO) to achieve SOTA performance with explainability.", "motivation": "LLMs excel at textual emotion reasoning but neglect fine-grained prosodic information crucial for speech affect recognition, limiting both performance and interpretability in multimodal emotion understanding.", "method": "VowelPrompt extracts phonetically-grounded prosodic descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments (pitch, energy, duration), converts them to natural language prompts for LLMs, and employs a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning and generalization.", "result": "Extensive evaluations show consistent SOTA outperformance across zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions on benchmark datasets, while generating interpretable explanations grounded in both semantics and prosodic structure.", "conclusion": "Linguistically-grounded vowel-level prosodic augmentation effectively bridges the gap between textual semantics and paralinguistic expressivity, enabling more accurate and interpretable LLM-based speech emotion recognition."}}

However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.\n  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSeeUPO\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u9006\u5411\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728AppWorld\u548cBFCL v4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b043-55%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e24\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0REINFORCE+GRAE\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46PPO+GRAE\u4f1a\u7834\u574fPPO\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faSeeUPO\uff08\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5e8f\u8d2f\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u6267\u884c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u56de\u5408\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9006\u5411\u5f52\u7eb3\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728AppWorld\u548cBFCL v4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cSeeUPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9aa8\u5e72\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff1aQwen3-14B\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f9743.3%-54.6%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0cQwen2.5-14B\u83b7\u5f9724.1%-41.9%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u5747\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eREINFORCE+GRAE\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u800cPPO+GRAE\u4f1a\u4e27\u5931\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "SeeUPO\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65e0\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \\textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions. Notably, Consequence-Based Utility consistently outperforms reward models, generative reward models, and LLM judges on ranking quality. Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2).

This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting.

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\u800c\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u5185\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u6620\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5185\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027(\u89c6\u89c9token\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u7b7e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728SEEDBench\u3001MMMU\u548cPOPE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u4ee3VLMs\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1)\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u53e0\u52a0\u7b49\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6f02\u79fb\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2)\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u672a\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u76f8\u7b49\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b3)\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u7834\u574f\u7c97/\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ec4\u5408\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea7\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1VLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "RuleSmith\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u3001LLM\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u6587\u660e\u6e38\u620fCivMini\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u8bd5\u73a9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f4\u89c9\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "RuleSmith\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3002LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u8bfb\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5219\u4e66\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80dc\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6807\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6295\u5f71\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u5019\u9009\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u5bf9\u5c40\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5019\u9009\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u8f83\u5c11\u5bf9\u5c40\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728CivMini\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0cRuleSmith\u6210\u529f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data. Collectively, these findings provide the first systematic evidence that targeted post-training can produce reliable and robust LLM-based causal reasoners.

We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost.\n  We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting.\n  Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes.

Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules.

In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding.

We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity.

For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.\n  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\\log^{1/4}T|\\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log|\\mathcal H|})$.\n  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \\mathrm{Ldim}(\\mathcal{H}) \u0394^2$, the existing lower bound $\u03a9(\\mathrm{Ldim}(\\mathcal{H}) \u0394)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners.

However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework", "code_url": "https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework", "code_stars": 0, "code_last_update": "2026-02-09", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u5f52\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u964d\u4f4e49%\uff09\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5efa\u7acb\u9762\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u52a8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08TAU-bench Airline\u548cAssistantBench\uff09\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f52\u56e0\u57fa\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08Spearman \u03c1=0.86\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b9a\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u9ad82.7\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u964d\u4f4e49%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u5411\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency.

These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $\u03a9(d^4 \\sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.\n  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \\sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \\sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $\u03a9(d \\sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient.

We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit.

This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students. The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 31.4% and surpassed the human benchmark of 30.8% on these complex cases. These results demonstrate that medical evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to master complex reasoning tasks.

Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets.

A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present \\textbf{RelayGen}, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory.

As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines.

While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment.

However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data.

While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $\u03a9(\\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.\n  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \\log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \\log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u4e50\u961f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7eaf\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u9057\u61be\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f/\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u51faTsallis-INF\u548cMaximin-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5747\u83b7\u5f97O(c log T)\u6e38\u620f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5e38\u88ab\u8feb\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u624b\u4e14\u4ec5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e50\u961f\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u4ec5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6240\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u6536\u76ca\uff09\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\u5b58\u5728\u03a9(\u221aT)\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u6b64\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u4e50\u961f\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u6536\u76ca\uff09\u548c\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u63ed\u793a\u6536\u76ca\u53ca\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u52a8\uff09\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u524d\u8005\u63d0\u51faTsallis-INF\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1Maximin-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5747\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570(c, c')\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTsallis-FTRL-SPM\u548cMaximin-LinUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\u4e0bTsallis-INF\u5b9e\u73b0O(c log T)\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\u4e0bMaximin-UCB\u5b9e\u73b0O(c' log T)\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dc'\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8ec\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7eaf\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u9057\u61be\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5728\u5e26\u4e50\u961f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u03a9(\u221aT)\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9650\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL.

But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes.

This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency.

To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove \"equal-rate\" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94(LoRA)\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(SpecGD)\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7248\u672c\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41(SpecGF)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\"\u7b49\u901f\u7387\"\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u6240\u6709\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4ee5\u76f8\u7b49\u901f\u7387\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5c0f\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6bd4\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u66f4\u65e9\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\"\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4f18\u5148\"\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u8303\u6570\u6709\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ece\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(\u5982Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668)\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u3002\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230LoRA\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5448\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5747\u5300\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a2\u7a76SpecGD\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7684LoRA\u98ce\u683c\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41(SpecGF)\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \"\u7b49\u901f\u7387\"\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u2014\u2014\u6240\u6709\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4ee5\u76f8\u7b49\u901f\u7387\u589e\u957f(\u4ec5\u542b\u5fae\u5c0f\u504f\u5dee)\uff1b(2) \u5c0f\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6bd4\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u66f4\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u98a0\u8986\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b(3) \u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u8303\u6570\u6709\u754c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0cSpecGF\u53ef\u4ece\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff1b(4) \u52a0\u5165\u2113\u2082\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u540e\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8c31\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728LoRA\u4f4e\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Muon\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fee\u8865\u548ck\u8fd1\u90bb\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6539\u8fdb\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6-\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6548\u7528\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u6743\u8861", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fee\u8865\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fee\u590d\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u4e25\u91cd\u6b20\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09k\u8fd1\u90bb\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u66ff\u6362\u8ddd\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u524d\u9988\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u57280.2-0.35\u7684\u4e2d\u7b49\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f7f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u7684\u6563\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a36%\uff0c\u6210\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534710-14%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u672a\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u7ea61%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6307\u6807\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u9608\u503c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8b\u540e\u4fee\u590d\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u53ef\u8865\u5145\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5f0f\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

We present \\textbf{PACT} (Prompt-configured Action via Chain-of-Thought), a framework for dynamic safety control through explicit, risk-aware reasoning. PACT operates under a hierarchical policy architecture: a non-overridable global safety policy establishes immutable boundaries for critical risks (e.g., child safety, violent extremism), while user-defined policies can introduce domain-specific (non-global) risk categories and specify label-to-action behaviors to improve utility in real-world deployment settings. The framework decomposes safety decisions into structured Classify$\\rightarrow$Act paths that route queries to the appropriate action (comply, guide, or reject) and render the decision-making process transparent.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PACT achieves near state-of-the-art safety performance under global policy evaluation while attaining the best controllability under user-specific policy evaluation, effectively mitigating the safety-helpfulness trade-off.

This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8eEEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u5224\u522b\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b\u4e2d\u6027\u3001\u79ef\u6781\u3001\u6d88\u6781\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u516c\u5f00EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u534f\u65b9\u5deeEEG\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u5224\u522b\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861EEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4eba\u672c\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers.

However, deliberately controlling the sentiment in these systems remains challenging. The present study investigates the potential of prompt engineering for controlling sentiment in LLM-generated text, providing a resource-sensitive and accessible alternative to existing methods. Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning.

Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a fully analytic framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling that augments ODE systems with sensitivity equations to compute exact parameter gradients, overcoming computational and stability limitations of numerical differentiation and automatic differentiation frameworks.", "motivation": "Conceptual hydrologic model calibration is slow and numerically fragile because gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks that are computationally demanding, introduce truncation errors and solver instabilities, and create substantial overhead for ODE systems.", "method": "The authors develop an analytic sensitivity-based approach by augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations to jointly evolve model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters, enabling exact gradient computation for any differentiable loss function.", "result": "The framework produces deterministic, physically interpretable gradients that eliminate step-size dependence and noise from numerical differentiation, avoid adjoint method instabilities and machine learning autodiff overhead, while supporting diverse loss functions including residuals, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling-Gupta efficiency, robust loss functions, and hydrograph-based functionals.", "conclusion": "This work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking differentiable modeling's full potential without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries."}}

To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b(GenRM)\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u51c6\u7684\u4f2a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faR-Align\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u63d0\u5347RLHF\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GenRM\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u76f8\u6096\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cdRLHF\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f2a\u6b63\u786e\u7387(S-Corr)\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u51c6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faR-Align\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u9ec4\u91d1\u5224\u65ad\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763GenRM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347 fidelity\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027GenRM\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457S-Corr\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8S-Corr\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u3002R-Align\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728STEM\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u51b3\u5b9aRLHF\u6210\u8d25\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u7eb3\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u504f\u597d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Memorize to Forget for Machine Unlearning", "comment": null, "summary": "For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model.

A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space.

As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes.

Accepted to the 24th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) (2026)", "summary": "Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.\n  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper challenges the conventional wisdom of concept drift detection by demonstrating that the \"window dilemma\" makes drift detection ill-posed and shows traditional batch learning methods often outperform specialized drift-aware techniques in data stream classification.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the fundamental assumption that concept drift detection is a well-posed problem by identifying that perceived drift is artificially induced by windowing mechanisms rather than genuine underlying data distribution changes, and that verification of drift events is practically impossible, making the entire detection paradigm questionable.", "method": "The authors introduce the theoretical \"Window Dilemma\" concept, illustrate it with a concrete example, and conduct empirical comparisons between established drift detectors and various alternative adaptation strategies including traditional batch learning techniques on data streams.", "result": "Empirical results demonstrate that traditional batch learning methods frequently achieve superior performance compared to specialized drift-aware detectors, revealing that perceived drift is largely a windowing artifact and that drift detection constitutes an ill-posed problem.", "conclusion": "The findings fundamentally question the purpose and utility of drift detectors in stream classification, suggesting the field may need to reconsider its focus and potentially favor simpler batch learning approaches over complex drift detection mechanisms."}}

We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference.

Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations.

Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this \"subwords manifest\" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868-\u8bed\u6599\u5e93-\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5b50\u8bcd\u6e05\u5355\"\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4WordPiece\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u7ea7\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\uff08NLI\u3001STS\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001NER\uff09\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\uff08POS\u3001\u4f9d\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff09\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u654f\u611f\u63a2\u9488\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff08\u8fb9\u754c\u7ea7F1\u3001\u8bcd\u5143\u539f\u5b50\u6027\u3001\u8fc7/\u6b20\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6570\u3001\u5b57\u7b26/\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u7eed\u7387\u3001\u8bcd\u7f00\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u5927\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5185\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u660e\u786e\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u7ea7\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff1b4\uff09\u5f00\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way.

These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \\( p \\) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \\( p \\) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \\( \\ell_p \\) norm constraints for values of $p \\in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks.

By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence.

In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings.

Currently under submission to npj Digital Medicine", "summary": "Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment.

However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability.

Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $\u03bb$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings.

We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows.

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model.

This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAEGIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u64e6\u9664\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u62b5\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5df2\u64e6\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7ef4\u6301\u65e0\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5f3a\u5316\u4e00\u65b9\u800c\u727a\u7272\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6458\u8981\u672a\u5448\u73b0\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u58f0\u79f0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AEGIS\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u534f\u540c\u5bf9\u6297\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027-\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \\emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Gr\u00f6nwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error.

Hyochan Chong and Dongkyu Kim contributed equally to this work", "summary": "Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware.

Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes.

Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance.

True intelligence relies on \"world models\" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds.

We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance.

However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge.

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining.

More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\\textbf{De}$coupled $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\\%.

However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.\n  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).", "AI": {"tldr": "Aurora presents a unified training-serving system for speculative decoding that closes the online learning loop by continuously adapting speculators from live inference traces, achieving 1.5x day-0 speedup and effective adaptation to distribution shifts.", "motivation": "Traditional decoupled speculator training-serving creates deployment lag (offline training delay), delayed utility feedback (speedup unknown until post-training), and domain-drift degradation (stale speculators on new domains).", "method": "Aurora reframes online speculator learning as asynchronous RL: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, rejected proposals provide implicit negative feedback.

We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images.

To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models.
