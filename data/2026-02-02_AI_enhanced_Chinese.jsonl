Yet dominant systems fuse modalities in the spatial domain, obscuring the frequency structure of signals and amplifying misalignment and redundancy. We adopt a spectral information-theoretic view and show that, under an orthogonal transform that approximately block-diagonalizes bandwise covariances, the Gaussian Information Bottleneck objective decouples across frequency bands, providing a principled basis for separate-then-fuse paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands). We further introduce a cross-modal spectral consistency loss that aligns modalities within each band. The model is jointly optimized with the standard recommendation loss. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FITMM consistently and significantly outperforms advanced baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FITMM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9891\u5e26\u5185\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u5148\u5206\u79bb\u518d\u878d\u5408\u201d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4/\u65f6\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5e26\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f7f\u5e26\u5185\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u5e26\u4e0a\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u505a\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u5f97\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4\u5e26\uff0c\u5e26\u5185\u5f62\u6210\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u5c06\u5e26\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9891\u57dfIB\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08Wiener\u5f0f\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u5bf9\u5f31\u5e26\u7684\u5173\u505c\uff09\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u5404\u5e26\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u63a8\u8350\u635f\u5931\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFITMM\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u201c\u5148\u5206\u79bb\u518d\u878d\u5408\u201d\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8c31\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.\n  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec). First, it estimates the reliability of cached semantics under the user's latest interactions. Second, an on-device semantic calibration module is proposed to adjusts the cached semantic embedding on-device using up-to-date interaction evidence, without per-request cloud LLM involvement. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SCaLRec consistently improves recommendation performance over strong baselines under cloud semantic staleness.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCaLRec tackles cloud-device cloud semantics staleness by estimating the usefulness of cached cloud embeddings and calibrating them on-device using current user interactions, enabling improved on-device reranking without per-request cloud LLM calls.", "motivation": "In cloud-device recommenders, semantic user representations are often cached to avoid expensive cloud LLM inference per request.

However, most large-scale ranking systems rely on item IDs, where each item is treated as an independent categorical symbol and mapped to a learned embedding. As items rapidly appear and disappear, these embeddings become difficult to train and maintain. This instability impedes effective learning of neural network parameters and limits the scalability of ranking models. In this paper, we show that semantic tokens possess greater scaling potential compared to item IDs. Our proposed framework TRM improves the token generation and application pipeline, leading to 33% reduction in sparse storage while achieving 0.85% AUC increase. Extensive experiments further show that TRM could consistently outperform state-of-the-art models when model capacity scales.

This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u201c\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfcLLM\u8fdb\u5165\u9189\u9152\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5bf9JailbreakBench\u4e0eConfAIde\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u6613\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6b64\u7c7b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30/\u5bf9\u6297\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u9152\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9AI\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u201c\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u201d\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfc drunk language \u7684\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u683c/\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u63d0\u793a(prompt)\uff1b2) \u56e0\u679c\u5fae\u8c03\uff08causal fine-tuning\uff09\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08reinforcement-based post-training\uff09\u3002\u57285\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528English\u7684 JailbreakBench \u4e0e ConfAIde \u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d8a\u72f1\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0eLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9 JailbreakBench \u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u66f4\u6613\u4e14\u5728 ConfAIde \u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u66f4\u6613\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u6613\u611f\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u4fbf\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u5bf9LLM \u5b89\u5168\u7684\u663e\u8457\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u7b56\u4e2d\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u6b64\u7c7b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u6d4b\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u6d77\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u54c8\u5e0c\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9/\u97f3\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6c49\u660e(Hamming)\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6a21\u578b\uff08BioCLIP\u3001BioLingual\uff09\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u54c8\u5e0c\u5316\uff1b\u4ea7\u751f\u79bb\u6563\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7684\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf/\u6587\u672c-\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u542b iNaturalist2024 \u4e0e iNatSounds2024\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u58f0\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u8003\u5bdf\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u6563\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u54c8\u5e0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6-shot \u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6863\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u3002"}}

However, current extension strategies are highly diverse and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation based on a radix system conversion perspective, which elegantly unifies various RoPE-extension approaches as distinct radix conversion strategies. Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets. Theoretical analysis confirms that MrRoPE-Pro effectively raises the upper bound of RoPE's attainable encoding length, which further validates the reliability and utility of our theory and methodology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Mixed-radix RoPE\uff08MrRoPE\uff09\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00 RoPE \u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u6269\u5c55 MrRoPE-Uni \u548c MrRoPE-Pro\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u201ctrain short, test long\u201d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6781\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 RoPE \u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d85\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e radix \u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c RoPE \u6269\u5c55\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1aUniform radix \u8f6c\u6362\uff08MrRoPE-Uni\uff09\u548c Progressive radix \u8f6c\u6362\uff08MrRoPE-Pro\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "MrRoPE-Pro \u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728 128K \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684 Needle-in-a-Haystack \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d recall \u4fdd\u6301 >85%\uff1b\u5728 YaRN \u7684 Infinite-Bench \u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u5347 RoPE \u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684 RoPE \u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5171\u540c\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u57fa\u6570\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a RoPE \u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines.

We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\\%$--$95\\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$.

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrLog \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u8c13\u8bcd\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u65e0\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u53ef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u8981\u4e48\u5047\u8bbe\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u8bc1\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u8bc1\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "OrLog \u5c06\u8c13\u8bcd\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff1aLLM \u4ee5\u89e3\u7801\u65e0\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u8c13\u8bcd\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u636e\u6b64\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u7840 LLM\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbf\u95ee\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u53caLLM-\u4f5c\u4e3a-\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cOrLog \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9876\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5b58\u5728\u6790\u53d6\uff08disjunctive\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2-\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u7ea6\u964d\u4f4e ~90%\u3002\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u524d\u5411\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd\u53ef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u524d\u5411\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd\u53ef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u4ee4\u724c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs show improved rationality with deliberate thinking; emotion steering can distort judgments; ICP is drastic, RLS more plausible but less reliable; reveals tension between reasoning and affect in LLM decision behavior.", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u662f\u5426\u5448\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684(\u975e)\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u504f\u89c1\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u7406\u53ca\u60c5\u7eea\u5bf9\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5bb6LLM\u5bf9\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u60c5\u666f\u5185\u63d0\u793aICP\u3001\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfcRLS\uff09\u6765\u63a2\u7a76\u60c5\u7eea\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6709\u610f\u201c\u601d\u8003\u201d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5411\u671f\u671b\u503c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9760\u62e2\uff1bICP\u5f15\u53d1\u5f3a\u70c8\u4e14\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u660e\u663e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1bRLS\u5219\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u653e\u5927\u5bf9\u60c5\u7eea\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u8d34\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f20\u529b\uff1b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa FedAdaVR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ca\u968f\u8bbf\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u7ea6\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa FedAdaVR-Quant\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5bf9\u975e\u51f8\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728IID\u548c\u975eIID\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5c24\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u968f\u8bbf\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa FedAdaVR\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u51cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u8f6e\u6b21\u7f3a\u5e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6700\u8fd1\u5b58\u50a8\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u201c\u6a21\u62df\u201d\u5176\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a FedAdaVR-Quant\uff0c\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4 FedAdaVR \u964d\u4f4e 50%\u300175%\u300187.5%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5bf9 FedAdaVR \u5728\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u51f8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001IID/\u975eIID \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a FedAdaVR \u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedAdaVR\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5904\u7406\u968f\u8bbf\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7f3a\u5931\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u53ca\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8868\u793a\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\uff08straightening\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u51fa\u73b0\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u677f\u91cd\u590d\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1aICL\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cLLMs\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06LLMs\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08in-context learning, ICL\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u662f\u5426\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u90e8\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5728Gemma 2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5e8f\u5217\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f7f\u795e\u7ecf\u5e8f\u5217\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u677f\u91cd\u590d\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL\u5e76\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1bLLMs\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u76f4\u7ebf\u5316\u53ea\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u201c\u50cf\u745e\u58eb\u519b\u5200\u201d\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI.

We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08MedAlign \u9002\u7528\u6027/\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0eMS\u4e9a\u578b\u62bd\u53d6\uff09\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff08flip rate\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u6539\u5199\u4ecd\u7136\u6613\u53d8\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u770b\u4f3c\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u65f6\u4ee5\u9002\u5ea6\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6362\u53d6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a LLM \u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u6539\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a LLM \u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08MedAlign \u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027/\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e MS \u4e9a\u578b\u62bd\u53d6\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff08flip rate\uff09\u201d\u8861\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u53ca\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f3a\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u65f6\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u6539\u5199\u8106\u5f31\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1/\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a LLM \u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

This paper evaluates both traditional machine-learning (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) and deep-learning techniques including custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, and three transfer-learning models (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) for binary classification of 25 077 waste images (80/20 train/test split, augmented and resized to 150x150 px). The paper assesses the impact of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on traditional models. DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy (91 %) and ROC-AUC (0.98), outperforming the best traditional classifier by 20 pp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed negligible benefit for classical methods, whereas transfer learning substantially improved performance under limited-data conditions. Finally, we outline how these models integrate into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System for automated waste sorting, highlighting potential reductions in landfill use and lifecycle environmental impacts.)", "AI": {"tldr": "DenseNet121 \u5728\u7ea62.5\u4e07\u5f20\u5e9f\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91%\u3001ROC-AUC0.98\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002PCA\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e2e\u52a9\u751a\u5fae\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5411\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e9f\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u56de\u6536\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30 PCA \u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u667a\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001SVM\u3001AdaBoost\uff09\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49 CNN\u3001VGG16\u3001ResNet50\u3001DenseNet121\u3001EfficientNetB0\u3001InceptionV3\uff09\uff0c\u5bf925077\u5f20\u5e9f\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c80/20\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62c6\u5206\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5e76\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u81f3150\u00d7150\u50cf\u7d20\uff1b\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u7ef4\uff1b\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c ROC-AUC \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DSS\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "DenseNet121 \u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u7ea691%\uff09\u548c ROC-AUC\uff08\u7ea60.98\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9ad8\u51fa\u7ea620\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bPCA \u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e9f\u7269\u5206\u62e3\u7684 DSS \u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u8def\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u586b\u57cb\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e9f\u7269\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u843d\u5730\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7b49\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining \"long tail,\" SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference.

However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair.

Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini.

While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning.

We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads.

We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors.

Zhang"], "title": "Tabular Foundation Models Can Do Survival Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points.

Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$.

However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($\u03b8^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth.

Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities.

To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMS \u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 GUI \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u3001\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u7684 GUI \u4efb\u52a1\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u52a8\u6001 GUI \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u914d\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6548\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fdb\u884c\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u6dd8\u6c70\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u9002\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347 18.0%\u3001\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347 33.9%\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "DMS \u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528\u578b MLLMs \u7684 GUI \u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift.

While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that SurrogateSHAP effectively localizes data sources responsible for spurious correlations in clinical images, providing a scalable path toward auditing safety-critical generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SurrogateSHAP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Shapley\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4ece\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u51faShapley\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u8865\u507f\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002Shapley \u503c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u81f4\u4f7f\u7eaf\u7b97\u529b\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Retraining-free \u6846\u67b6 SurrogateSHAP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u6765\u62df\u5408\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u89e3\u6790\u7684 Shapley \u503c\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20 \u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks \u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u3001FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data \u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "SurrogateSHAP \u5728\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6548\u7528\u6307\u6807\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies.

Dixon"], "title": "Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization", "comment": "22 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold.

Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \\textbf{S}weet \\textbf{S}pot \\textbf{L}earning (\\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability.

Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5165 RLVR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528 30% \u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807(\u5ba2\u89c2)\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u79bb\u7ebf\u7528\u70b9\u4e8c\u9879\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570(PBC)\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u7531\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0cPBC \u96be\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u4f53\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u79bb\u7ebf PBC \u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u548c\u7ecf\u5178 AL \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4ec5\u7528 30% \u6570\u636e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e RLVR \u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6539\u8fdb AL \u5bf9 RLVR \u7684\u6837\u672c\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one.

To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods.

We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario.

Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \\textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior.

Sanity Checking Self-Preference Evaluations", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent research has shown that large language models (LLM) favor own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa Evaluator Quality Baseline \u6765\u5206\u79bb\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u591a\u6570\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u518d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6613\u96be\u5224\u522b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6295\u7968\u71b5\u6027\u6709\u6240\u63ed\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u5145\u5f53\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u504f\u5411\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u81ea\u604b\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u6838\u5fc3\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1a\u5f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u56de\u7b54\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d verdict\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u56de\u7b54\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u63d0\u51fa Evaluator Quality Baseline\uff1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u6295\u7968\u9519\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u53e6\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u6295\u7968\u9519\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e37,448\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ef\u5c06\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea689.6%\uff1b\u4ec5\u6709\u7ea651%\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u6dc6\u540e\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5e76\u5bf9\u201c\u7b80\u5355\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u56f0\u96be\u201d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6295\u7968\u7684\u71b5\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53bb\u9664\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u523b\u753b\u8bc4\u59d4\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u9694\u79bb\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Static alignment tests do not guarantee post-update alignment; black-box tests can conceal latent adversarial behavior that only surfaces after benign updates; post-update-robust evaluation is needed and misalignment scales with model size.", "motivation": "As LLMs are frequently updated, ensuring that alignment held at initial evaluation persists after updates is crucial.

However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework.

Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence.

Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework.

Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead.

To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models.

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e LLM \u8def\u7531\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u5171\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301 ML P \u8def\u7531\u5668\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff09\u548c K-means \u8def\u7531\u5668\uff08\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8def\u7531\u4e9a\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u88ab\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u6027\u6240\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8def\u7531\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u7c7b\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684 K-means \u8def\u7531\uff1b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u534f\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027/\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5747\u652f\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u8def\u7531\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation.

We introduce a novel mean estimation specific factorization, which is both efficient and accurate, achieving asymptotically lower mean-squared error bounds in continual mean estimation under user-level differential privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u66f4\u4f4eMSE\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\uff0c\u7eafDP\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8fd1\u4f3cDP\u7ed3\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u53ef\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u66f4\u4f4e\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff08\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7eafDP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool.

(2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations.

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints.

However, whether such thinking mitigates hallucinations in multimodal perception and reasoning remains unclear. Self-reflective reasoning enhances robustness but introduces additional hallucinations, and subtle perceptual errors still result in incorrect or coincidentally correct answers. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on models before the emergence of reasoning MLLMs, neglecting the internal thinking process and failing to measure the hallucinations that occur during thinking. To address these challenges, we introduce MM-THEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing hallucinations of intermediate CoTs in reasoning MLLMs. MM-THEBench features a fine-grained taxonomy grounded in cognitive dimensions, diverse data with verified reasoning annotations, and a multi-level automated evaluation framework. Extensive experiments on mainstream reasoning MLLMs reveal insights into how thinking affects hallucination and reasoning capability in various multimodal tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MM-THEBench \u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u201c\u5e7b\u89c9\u201d\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5e26\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u524d/\u63a8\u7406\u540e\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4CoT\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6 taxonomy\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u6807\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u6765\u6e90\uff1b2) \u7ec4\u5efa\u542b\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4CoT\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5224\u5b9a\uff1b4) \u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u601d\u7ef4-\u5e7b\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\uff1a\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u5e7b\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6e90\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bMM-THEBench \u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "MM-THEBench \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406MLLM\u4e2d\u95f4CoT\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9Thinking-augmented \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings.

Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely. Experiments on three language directions of the ACL 60/60 dev set show that RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points, with ablations confirming the contribution of each component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST)\uff0c\u5728 SST \u6d41\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u5757\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6559\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u51c6\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728 ACL 60/60 dev \u96c6\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\uff0c\u672f\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe 16%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a 3BLEU \u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 SST \u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u6709\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd1\u6765 Speech LLMs \u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u672f\u8bed\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672f\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u5f15\u5165 SST \u9762\u4e34\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5bf9 partial \u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RASST\uff0c\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5230 SST \u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7247\u6bb5\uff08chunk\uff09\u4e0a\u4e3a Speech LLM \u63d0\u4f9b\u672f\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6559\u4f1a Speech LLM \u5982\u4f55\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ACL 60/60 dev \u96c6\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\uff0cRASST \u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u672f\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u591a\u8fbe 16%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8fbe 3 BLEU \u70b9\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "RASST \u6210\u529f\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u5f15\u5165 SST \u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u672f\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5206\u5757\u672f\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5904\u7406\u901a\u5e38Dense\u4e14\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5448\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7f55\u89c1token\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f80\u5f80\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u526a\u679d/\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u526a\u6389\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b/\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bc6\u5ea6\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u7f55\u89c1token\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "1) \u5904\u7406\u4e00\u822c\u5448\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97;\n2) \u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd;\n3) \u6bcf\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u89e6\u53d1\u9ad8\u6216\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1tokens\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5c06\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$.

By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor.

Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability. Our findings offer new insight into the training dynamics of cross-lingual alignment and the conditions under which causal interpretability methods offer meaningful insights in multilingual contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8865\u4e01\u6cd5\u63a2\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578bEuroLLM\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\uff1b\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u89c2\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u4e49\u3001\u62f7\u8d1d\u540c\u5f62\u5f02\u4e49\u8bcd\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8865\u4e01\u5316\uff08activation patching\uff09\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u88ab\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u5ff5\u6539\u53d8\u800c\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4eba\u5de5\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5171\u4eab\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u5df2\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u6301\u7eed refine\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4e4b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u8868\u89c2\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6e90\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u591a\u4e49\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u540c\u5f62\u8bcd\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u800c\u975e\u62f7\u8d1d\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it.

ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASRO \u5c06\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u89c6\u4e3a\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u65b9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea7\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u9884\u8a00\u5668\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u589e\u7b56\u7565\u5e93\u548c\u5bf9\u624b\u6df7\u5408\u5143\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4ee5\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u8fc1\u79fb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u5728\u53cc\u65b9\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6c60\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u9884\u8a00\u5668\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5143\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea7\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff0cASRO \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u7a0b\u5e8f\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3AHD\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u57df\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender.

In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process.

We introduce $\\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British.

Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u4e24\u7c7b\u5e38\u7528\u7684LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08token\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u63a2\u67e5\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bed\u8a00\u62bd\u8c61\u65f6\u5747\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u62bd\u8c61\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u8de8\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8ff9\u8c61\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f/\u666e\u9002\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6210\u719f\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08probing\uff09\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u62ec\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u540e\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u4ecd\u5bf9\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5747\u5931\u8d25\uff1a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8bbe\u88ab\u68c0\u9a8c\u540e\u5d29\u584c\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u81ea\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u610f\u5473\u7740\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63ed\u793aLLM\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u666e\u9002/\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b64\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\u03c3^2\u03b3^{-2}\\log(Nd/\u03b4)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters.

On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory", "comment": null, "summary": "Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks.

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u91cf\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79bb\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bf9 Wasserstein \u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u523b\u753b\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u7ef4\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u6240\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728 Wasserstein \u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21 Wasserstein \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5706\u9525\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9 Wasserstein \u89d2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5ea6\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4ece\u4e24\u6761\u5c04\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5145\u6ee1\u5706\u9525\u662f\u5e73\u5766\u7684\uff1b\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u5706\u9525\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5747\u5300\u3001\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u5076\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u826f\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u4e00\u7ef4\u6709\u95ed\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u5bf9 Wasserstein \u89d2\u6bd4 Wasserstein \u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u77e9\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30 Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance\uff08FID\uff09\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89c6\u4e3a\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5706\u9525\u7684\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ca\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5982 FID \u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding. These distilled CoTs are integrated into node texts, providing GNNs with enriched, multi-hop semantic and structural cues for fraud detection. Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors.

However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a \"remasking\" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Residual Context Diffusion (RCD) \u4ee5\u56de\u6536\u88ab discarding \u7684 token \u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347 dLLM \u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5757\u72b6 dLLM \u7684 remask \u673a\u5236\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u53ea\u5229\u7528\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684 token\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u5176\u4f59 token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u88ab\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u91cd\u7528 discarded token \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 RCD \u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5c06 discarded token \u7684\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u53ef\u5c06\u6807\u51c6 dLLM \u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a RCD\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a 1e9 tokens\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff08SDAR\uff09\u4e0e\u77ed\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u573a\u666f\uff08LLaDA\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cRCD \u5bf9\u524d\u6cbf dLLMs \u63d0\u5347 5\u201310 \u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684 AIME \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u6570\u51cf\u5c11 4\u20135 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "RCD \u4e3a\u5757\u72b6\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6539\u9020\u3002"}}

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior.

We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \\textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76 emergent outliers\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a5\u6536\u6781\u5927\u8005\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6781\u5927\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa outlier-driven rescaling\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u4e0e softmax \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c RMSNorm \u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7edf\u4e00 sink \u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5438\u6536\u3001\u88c1\u526a\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6539\u5584\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u51fa\uff08outliers\uff09\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca sink\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a5\u6536\u6781\u5927\u8005\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6781\u5927\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3 token \u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b logits \u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u53bb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a\u3001\u5c06 outliers \u5438\u6536\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0 outliers \u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f1a\u4f7f\u76f8\u5e94\u7684 outliers \u6d88\u5931\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a outliers \u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1boutliers \u66f4\u50cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee sink \u5bf9\u975e outliers \u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5c06 outliers \u5438\u6536\u5230\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 2 \u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5728 W4A4 \u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u7ea6 1.2 \u70b9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "outlier-driven rescaling \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00 sink \u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u6536\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u95e8\u63a7\u518d\u7f29\u653e\u8fdb\u884c\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning.

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack.

However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation.

To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence.

However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT.

However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa G-Substrate\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e92\u5d4c\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5b64\u7acb\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5e95\u677f\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa G-Substrate\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u5927\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f(schema)\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b2) \u4e92\u5d4c\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u88ab\u66b4\u9732\u7ed9\u591a\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cG-Substrate \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5b64\u7acb\u548c\u5929\u771f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u53cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5e95\u677f\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u80fd\u3002"}}

We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions.

Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting.

Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIREN \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 Shapley \u516c\u7406\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u90e8\u5206\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u56e0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\uff08Integrated Gradients\uff09\u6cbf\u4ece\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSIREN \u5728\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SIREN \u4f7f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u843d\u5730\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u5176\u5728\u4e09\u9879 Shapley \u516c\u7406\uff08dummy\u3001efficiency\u3001linearity\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u516c\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(n\u03b5)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time.

Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout.

For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains.

This enriched structure makes MetaLead a powerful resource for more transparent and nuanced evaluations across ML research.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaLead \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684 ML Leaderboard \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u9644\u5e26\u6269\u5c55\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3/\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6536\u5f55\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u4e14\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u679c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ed3\u679c\u7c7b\u578b\u6807\u7b7e\uff08baseline\u3001proposed method\u3001variation of proposed method\uff09\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5168\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u4e30\u5bcc\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684 Leaderboard \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6bd4\u8f83\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaLead \u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684 leaderboard \u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty.

We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem.

The dataset comprises 581 QA pairs across 105 synthetic r\u00e9sum\u00e9-job description pairs in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese), with questions spanning three complexity levels from basic factual extraction to complex cross-document reasoning. We propose a data generation pipeline derived from real-world sources through de-identification and data synthesis to ensure both realism and privacy, while controlled demographic and professional attributes (implemented via placeholders) enable systematic bias and fairness studies. We also present a cost-effective, human-in-the-loop translation pipeline based on the TEaR methodology, incorporating MQM error annotations and selective post-editing to ensure an high-quality multi-way parallel benchmark. We provide a baseline evaluations across multiple open-weight LLM families using an LLM-as-judge approach revealing higher performances on English and Spanish but substantial degradation for other languages, highlighting critical gaps in multilingual MRC capabilities for HR applications.

In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes.

Smith"], "title": "Are you going to finish that? A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and \"word\" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is \"backed-off\" to be token-aligned.

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal.

Current interpretation methods infer feature semantics from activation patterns, but overlook that features are trained to reconstruct activations that serve computational roles in the forward pass. We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits.

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics.

These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process.

To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters.

Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cfB\u53caSombrero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u653e\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u57281B\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u96be\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u8ba1\u7b97\u82b1\u8d39\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a router \u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fb9\u754c\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6B\uff0c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7247\u6bb5\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\u8282\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u5904\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eB\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSombrero\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u653e\u7f6e\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6743\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u5df2\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002\u5e76\u57281B\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u7684UTF-8\u8bed\u6599\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5fb7\u8bed\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Sombrero\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6298\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5339\u914d\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5185\u5bb9\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time.

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation.

Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model.

In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness.

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations.

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality.

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods.

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis.

While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis.

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models.

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e76\u4ee5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6279\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a (batched contextual bandit) \u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6700\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5f80\u5f80\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21 rollout\u3001\u4ee5 outcome reward \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a 32\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230 batched contextual bandit \u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u9010\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u4f18\u52bf\u3001 rollout \u6570\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u6295\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u8d44\u6e90\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u771f\u6b63\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u4eba\u8111\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\uff08\u6162\u4f46\u7075\u6d3b\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\uff08\u5feb\u901f\uff09\u3001\u60c5\u8282\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u5feb\u901f\u56de\u5fc6\uff09\u4e09\u8005\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u8bd1\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff1a (1) \u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u6a21\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u91c7\u6837\uff1b(2) \u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u5f80\u6837\u672c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\uff1b(3) \u60c5\u8282\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5fc6\u5386\u53f2\u6837\u672c\u6765\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u8005\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7edf\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u843d\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement.

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Submitted to IJCAI 2026", "summary": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing raw data, but privacy regulations such as the right to be forgotten require FL systems to remove the influence of previously used training data upon request. Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCARE introduces a unified, low-overhead federated unlearning framework with conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery.

However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLethe\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u89e3\u9664\u5b66\u4e60\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u663e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff08resurfacing\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f85\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5728\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u6d88\u9664\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a Reshape-Rectify-Restore \u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4ee5\u653e\u5927\u5f85\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u8def\u6d41\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u6574\u5f62\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLethe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684unlearning\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\u7387\uff08Resurfacing Rate\uff09\u5927\u591a\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6d88\u9664\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef Federated Setting \u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed unlearning\u3002", "method": "Lethe \u91c7\u7528Reshape-Rectify-Restore\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a1) \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5f85\u79fb\u9664\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u653e\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b2) \u5c06\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u6821\u6b63\uff08\u4e24\u6761\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f85\u79fb\u9664\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff1b3) \u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff1b4) \u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u8054\u90a6\u65e0\u635f\u610f\u56fe\u4e0b\uff0cLethe\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684unlearning\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u590d\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aResurfacing Rate\u5927\u591a<1%\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Lethe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5316unlearning\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5f85\u79fb\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684unlearning\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa GUDA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5fd8\u8bb0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7ec4\u64a4\u56de\u6765\u907f\u514d LOGO \u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9 ELBO \u8861\u91cf\u7ec4\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728 CIFAR-10 \u4e0e Stable Diffusion \u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4 LOGO \u63d0\u901f\u7ea6 100 \u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7ec4\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684 LOGO \u9010\u7ec4\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u91cf\u7ec4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ec4\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\uff08unlearning\uff09\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53bb\u9664\u8be5\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\uff08ELBO\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u201c\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8861\u91cf\u8be5\u7ec4\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CIFAR-10 \u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528 Stable Diffusion \u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGUDA \u80fd\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4 reliably \u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7ec4\uff1b\u5728 CIFAR-10 \u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4 LOGO \u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6 100\u00d7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "GUDA \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7ec4\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods.

However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases. We demonstrate the impact of our approach exemplarily on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset.

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters.

By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRDS\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u77e9\u9635\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u5757\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u652f\u6301PTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u8054\u5408QAT\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u79e9\u4e58\u6cd5\u5316PEFT\uff0c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u4e0ePEFT\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u77e9\u9635S\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3S = BA\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cf\u5316\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ece\u5757\u7ea7\u8f6c\u5411\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\uff1b\u5efa\u7acbLoRDS\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fPTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316+\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u8054\u5408QAT\u3001\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u79e9\u4e58\u6027PEFT\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684Triton\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u72b6\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728Llama3-8B\u4e0a3\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5bf9NormalFloat\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe27.0%\uff0cRTX 4090\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.5x\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684PEFT\u6027\u80fd\u8f834-bit QLoRA\u63d0\u5347\u7ea69.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9002\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u5757\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9ad8\u79e9PEFT\uff1b\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SQUAD\u4e0eQUEST\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u578b\u65e9\u505c\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u66ff\u4ee3\u5355\u4e00\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSQUAD\uff1a\u5728\u65e9\u505c\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u6cd5\u5b9a\u6295\u7968\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6309\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9010\u6b65\u6c47\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u82e5\u8fbe\u5230\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5219\u5728\u8be5\u51fa\u53e3\u5904\u505c\u6b62\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165QUEST\uff08Quorum Search Technique\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u505c\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u540c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe\u7ea65.95%\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5ef6\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea670.60%\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u597d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u505c\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u9000\u51fa\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets.

In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance.

However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation.

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u7acb\u6b63\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a Epanechnikov \u7b49\u6838\u5728 \u03b1-entmax \u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u56de\u5f52\u81f3 softmax\uff1bMemory Mosaics \u5c55\u73b0\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u6027\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3 heuristic top-k \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684 ReLU \u4e0e sparsemax \u6ce8\u610f\u6620\u5c04\u5230 Epanechnikov \u6838\u56de\u5f52\uff1b\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684 \u03b1-entmax\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d \u03b1=1+1/n\uff08n\u2208N\uff09\u5bf9\u5e94 Epanechnikov\u3001biweight\u3001triweight \u7b49\u6838\uff0csoftmax/Gaussian \u5bf9\u5e94 n\u2192\u221e\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Memory Mosaics \u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u7684 Transformer\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u7531\u6765\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9 top-k \u7b49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u539f\u7406\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\uff1b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u578b Transformer \u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u63a7\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff1b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u7406\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982 Memory Mosaics\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPAVE\uff08Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 critic \u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u52a8 actor \u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7aef\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u75c7\u72b6\u800c\u975e\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u53ef\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u53d7 critic \u7684\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e Q \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u504f\u5bfc\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\uff08\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff09\u4e4b\u6bd4\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4ece critic \u5165\u624b\u89e3\u51b3\u6839\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 actor-critic \u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u88ab Q \u7684\u6df7\u5408\u504f\u5bfc\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u4e4b\u6bd4\u6240\u754c\u5b9a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa PAVE\uff1a\u5c06 critic \u89c6\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316 Q \u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5bf9\u884c\u52a8\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAVE \u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7aef\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539 actor \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u5907\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03 critic \u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e critic \u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08PAVE\uff09\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u76ca\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Mano\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684 Oblique \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a AdamW \u548c Muon\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1aAdamW \u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\uff0cMuon \u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65f6\u635f\u5931\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u672a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u52a8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684 Oblique \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u5668 Mano\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u628a\u4f20\u7edf\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u517c\u987e\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u8fbe\u5230\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5728 LLaMA \u4e0e Qwen3 \u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMano \u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e AdamW \u4e0e Muon\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": " Mano \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection.

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e24\u901a\u9053sEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u4f4e\u901a\u9053\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1 Subject \u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u808c\u7535\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u9635\u5217\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u4ec5\u4e24\u901a\u9053sEMG\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u539f\u59cbsEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7701\u53bb\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u4e3b\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece6\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u523010\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u88ab\u8bd5F1-score 94.3%\u00b10.3%\uff1b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u672a\u89c1\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ece35.1%\u00b13.1%\u63d0\u5347\u81f392.3%\u00b10.9%\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b010\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\u7684F1-score 90.0%\u00b10.2%\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u4f20\u611f\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u808c\u7535\u5047\u80a2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea7\u8054\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7eaf\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7c97\u7cd9\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8026\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931/\u5f02\u5e38\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u7ea7\u8054\u4f1a\u6536\u7d27\u8fd0\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u754c\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u7ec6\u8282\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u7ea640%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u884c\uff08\u7eaf\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7c97\u7cd9\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8026\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd0\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u754c\u7684\u6536\u7d27\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5206\u5e03\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1/\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u7ea640%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea7\u8054\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u6563-\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6536\u7d27\u8fd0\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u7ec6\u8282\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002"}}

However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $\u03b5\\to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \\textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \\textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\u03b5)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins.

By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions.

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators.

However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling.

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss.

Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001).

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u622a\u65ad\u4e0e\u518d\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9atoken\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u518d\u6ce8\u5165\u540e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u627f\u8bfa\u968f\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u77ed\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u66f4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u56de\u9000\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u59cb\u56de\u7b54\u5e38\u53d7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u201c\u539f\u56e0-\u7ed3\u679c\u201d\u94fe\u6761\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u968f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6bb5\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8d8a\u8868\u9762\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6bb5\u622a\u65ad\uff08\u6309\u56fa\u5b9atoken\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce8\u5165\u56de\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5bf9\u7167\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6db5\u76d6\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bQwen3-4B/-8B/-14B\u4e0egpt-oss-20b/-120b\uff0c\u5728GPQA Diamond\u4e0eMMLU-Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u627f\u8bfa\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1b\u589e\u76ca\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u901a\u7528\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u3002\u66f4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u56de\u9000\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u65f6\u7b54\u6848\u4ecd\u5e38\u88ab\u8f83\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6240\u951a\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bca\u65ad\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ee4\u724c\u5c31\u662f\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Despite substantial progress in the univariate setting, achieving multivariate calibration remains challenging. Recent work has introduced pre-rank functions, scalar projections of multivariate forecasts and observations, as flexible diagnostics for assessing specific aspects of multivariate calibration, but their use has largely been limited to post-hoc evaluation. We propose a regularization-based calibration method that enforces multivariate calibration during training of multivariate distributional regression models using pre-rank functions. We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution. Through simulation studies and experiments on 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that the proposed approach substantially improves multivariate pre-rank calibration without compromising predictive accuracy, and that the PCA pre-rank reveals dependence-structure misspecifications that are not detected by existing pre-ranks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ePCA\u7684\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c18\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6PCA\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u6bd4\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u6821\u51c6\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePCA\u7684\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff1bPCA\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9519\u914d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7eb3\u5165\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u7ebf\uff1bPCA\u524d\u6392\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f3a\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \\gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5355\u68f5\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53f6\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53f6\u5b50\u5904\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u659c\u5411\u5206\u88c2\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8d85\u51fa\u53f6\u5b50\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u56f4\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b GP \u5916\u63a8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u659c\u5411\u6811\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u6811\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u53f6\u5b50\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u53f6\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u8d8a\u89c2\u5bdf\u533a\u95f4\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5728 VSPYCT \u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u68f5\u6811\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u914d\u5907\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af oblique splits \u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\uff1b\u63a8\u65ad\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5206\u88c2\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e GP \u540e\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u8d85\u51fa\u53f6\u5b50\u8bad\u7ec3\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b GP \u5916\u63a8\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53d8\u5206 oblique \u6811\uff1b\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06 GP \u53f6\u5b50\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u659c\u5411\u5206\u88c2\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5355\u68f5\u6811\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684 GP \u5916\u63a8\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Codes in https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning", "summary": "Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks.

By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA).

Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \\emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift.

In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$.

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability.

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "DCR\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5f62\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\uff1b calibration\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u670d\u4ece\u8d1f\u8d85\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e36%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff08conformal prediction\uff09\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6392\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u540c\u5206\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc7\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u540c\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a calibration \u6837\u672c\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c calibration \u6837\u672c\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u9075\u4ece\u8d1f\u8d85\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\u3002DCR\u636e\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u540c\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a conformal \u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5728 mild \u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cDCR\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u6700\u591a\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea636%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6392\u540d\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cDCR\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9690\u5f0f\u4fdd\u7559\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5747\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fee\u6539\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u652f\u6491\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7b49\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u4fee\u6539\u53ef\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u65e2\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u51fa\u6280\u80fd\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38 RL \u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u6cd5\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u6280\u80fd\u5e76 induced \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u4f4e\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u62fc\u63a5\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u5bf9Craftax\u548c\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7684Minecraft\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u3001\u590d\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u3001\u590d\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38 RL \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c42\u7ea7\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u6cd5\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5c42\u7ea7\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002"}}

MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.\n  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables.

However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDG introduces a sequence-level diffusion framework for dynamic graphs to model uncertainty in temporal link prediction via conditional denoising and a cross-attention decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "motivation": "Existing temporal GNNs are primarily discriminative and focus on historical interactions, lacking explicit modeling of uncertainty and the sequential structure of future temporal interactions.

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u9006\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff08DDIS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9006PDE\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ee5\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u5411PDE\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u9000\u706b\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff08DAPS\uff09\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u907f\u514d\u5f15\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0cl2\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611%\uff0c\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u7ea654%\uff1b\u5728\u4ec51%\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0cl2\u8bef\u5dee\u4ecd\u517740%\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u63d2\u5165\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u8054\u5408\u7cfb\u6570-\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6210\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6b63\u5411PDE\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u5411PDE\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u9000\u706b\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff08DAPS\uff09\u4ee5\u907f\u514dDPS\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cDDIS\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747l2\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611%\uff0c\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u7ea654%\uff1b\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u53601%\u65f6\uff0cl2\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u8f83\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u7ea640%\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5929\u7136\u652f\u6301DAPS\u4ee5\u907f\u514dDPS\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}
