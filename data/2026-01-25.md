### [1] [Entropy-Tree: Tree-Based Decoding with Entropy-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15296)
*Longxuan Wei,Yubo Zhang,Zijiao Zhang,Zhihu Wang,Shiwan Zhao,Tianyu Huang,Huiting Zhao,Chenfei Liu,Shenao Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Entropy-Tree，一种基于树的解码策略，通过在模型表现出不确定性的位置扩展搜索树来实现高效且校准的推理解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码策略要么盲目探索（随机采样），要么产生冗余工作（独立多采样），难以在探索效率与不确定性估计之间取得平衡。需要一个能在保持探索效率的同时提供可靠不确定性度量的解码方法。

Method: 引入基于信息熵的分支信号，构建树状解码过程，在模型出现显著不确定时才扩展分支，结合结构化探索与不确定性估计于同一解码过程，即 Entropy-Tree。

Result: 在推理任务中实现更高的准确性与校准性；pass@k 指标优于 Multi-chain，且跨多模型与数据集成立；预测熵的 AUROC 相较传统度量更具区分力。

Conclusion: Entropy-Tree 将高效结构化探索与可靠不确定性估计统一在单一解码过程，提升推理性能与不确定性评估的稳定性。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, yet existing decoding strategies either explore blindly (random sampling) or redundantly (independent multi-sampling). We propose Entropy-Tree, a tree-based decoding method that exploits entropy as a signal for branching decisions--expanding the search tree only at positions where the model exhibits genuine uncertainty. Entropy-Tree shows superior accuracy and calibration in reasoning tasks: it achieves better pass@k than Multi-chain across multiple models and datasets, and its predictive entropy demonstrates better AUROC compared to several traditional metrics. Entropy-Tree unifies efficient structured exploration and reliable uncertainty estimation within a single decoding procedure.

### [2] [AfriEconQA: A Benchmark Dataset for African Economic Analysis based on World Bank Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15297)
*Edward Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 AfriEconQA，专门用于非洲经济分析的基准数据集，基于236份世界银行报告构建，共8,937条QA实例，需高精度数值推理与时间维度辨析。通过11个实验矩阵对零-shot与RAG系统进行评测，零-shot模型在超过90%的查询上无法回答，表明现有IR/RAG在域特定知识与数值推理方面存在明显缺口；数据集与代码将在发表后公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补当前对非洲经济分析数据稀缺、缺乏域内数值推理和时间辨析能力评估的问题；提供一个具有挑战性的领域专用IR/RAG基准，推动更强的检索与推理能力。

Method: 从236份世界银行报告中筛选并构建8,937条经严格筛选的QA实例，原始样本来自1万多条合成问题；每条包含问题、证据、经过验证的真实答案和源元数据（URL与出版日期）以确保时序信息；通过11个实验矩阵对零-shot（GPT-5 Mini）与基于RAG的配置（GPT-4o和Qwen 32B）在五种嵌入与排序策略下进行比较；评估重点在于信息检索的证据对齐与数值推理的准确性。

Result: 零-shot模型在超过90%的查询上无法回答，且最先进的RAG系统在精度方面也难以达到高水平；这揭示了参数级知识缺口以及现有RAG对域内高精度数值与时间辨析的不足。该基准被证明具备强鲁棒性与挑战性，可用于推动下一代领域专用IR与RAG系统的发展。

Conclusion: AfriEconQA作为面向非洲经济分析的第一批基准，将公开发布数据集与代码，挑战现有模型并驱动域内IR/RAG的创新。

Abstract: We introduce AfriEconQA, a specialized benchmark dataset for African economic analysis grounded in a comprehensive corpus of 236 World Bank reports. The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.

### [3] [Embedding Retrofitting: Data Engineering for better RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15298)
*Anantha Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Preprocessing quality dominates retrofitting performance: noisy annotations inflate KG density and cause spurious edges, leading to degradation; cleaning via preprocessing enables EWMA retrofitting to improve retrieval, especially on quantitative synthesis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why retrofitting performance fails on real-world corpora and how data quality (annotation artifacts) affects knowledge-graph-based constraints.

Method: Introduce a data engineering framework to mitigate data quality degradation; analyze the impact of hashtag-induced KG density; compare retrofitting methods on clean vs noisy graphs; apply EWMA retrofitting with/without preprocessing; report domain-specific retrieval gains.

Result: Noisy graphs cause universal degradation in retrofitting (-3.5% to -5.2%, p<0.05). After preprocessing, EWMA retrofitting improves by +6.2% (p=0.0348), with +33.8% average gains on quantitative synthesis questions.

Conclusion: Preprocessing quality is the main determinant of retrofitting success; the performance gap due to data cleaning (>10%) eclipses algorithmic differences (~3%). Prioritize data preprocessing to realize retrofitting benefits.

Abstract: Embedding retrofitting adjusts pre-trained word vectors using knowledge graph constraints to improve domain-specific retrieval. However, the effectiveness of retrofitting depends critically on knowledge graph quality, which in turn depends on text preprocessing. This paper presents a data engineering framework that addresses data quality degradation from annotation artifacts in real-world corpora.
  The analysis shows that hashtag annotations inflate knowledge graph density, leading to creating spurious edges that corrupt the retrofitting objective. On noisy graphs, all retrofitting techniques produce statistically significant degradation ($-3.5\%$ to $-5.2\%$, $p<0.05$). After preprocessing, \acrshort{ewma} retrofitting achieves $+6.2\%$ improvement ($p=0.0348$) with benefits concentrated in quantitative synthesis questions ($+33.8\%$ average). The gap between clean and noisy preprocessing (10\%+ swing) exceeds the gap between algorithms (3\%), establishing preprocessing quality as the primary determinant of retrofitting success.

### [4] [Intelligence Degradation in Long-Context LLMs: Critical Threshold Determination via Natural Length Distribution Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15300)
*Weiwei Wang,Jiyong Min,Weijie Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开放源代码Qwen模型在长上下文中存在临界阈值，40-50%最大长度处显著降性能；提出自然长度分布分析、临界阈值确定和统一框架以解释与缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补对长上下文中智力降解的系统性研究不足，提供可重复、可验证的阈值分析与框架以指导实际部署。

Method: 采用未截断/未填充的自然长度样本，结合混合数据集(1000个样本，覆盖上下文长度的5%-95%)，进行五折交叉验证，对Qwen2.5-7B进行评估；分三部分开展自然长度分布分析、临界阈值确定、统一框架建模。

Result: 在最大上下文长度的40-50%处，F1由0.55-0.56降至0.3，约45.5%的降幅；提出统一框架以解释智力降解并为缓解提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 首次对开放源代码Qwen模型在长上下文中的智力降解进行系统表征，为在长上下文情境下的部署提供实用指导与框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit catastrophic performance degradation when processing contexts approaching certain critical thresholds, even when information remains relevant. This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation. (3) Unified Framework: We consolidate shallow adaptation, explaining degradation patterns and providing a foundation for mitigation strategies. This work provides the first systematic characterization of intelligence degradation in open-source Qwen models, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in long-context scenarios.

### [5] [ICPO: Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15330)
*Zhebo Wang,Xiaohu Mu,Zijie Zhou,Mohan Li,Wenpeng Xing,Dezhang Kong,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO)，通过对不明确指令的建模与以用户 illocutionary 意图为条件的奖励信号，缓解多轮对话中的 lost-in-conversation 问题，实现对模型谦逊度的提升；在多轮对话上平均提升约75%，单轮任务表现保持稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中，模型易因早期错误假设而偏离，尤其在用户给出模糊初始指令时；现有的强化学习等后训练方法（如 RLVR）倾向奖励自信、直接的回答，抑制寻求澄清的行为。

Method: 在训练语料中增加 underspecified prompts，按用户的 illocutionary 意图对奖励信号进行条件化，奖励在模糊情境下表达不确定性或提出澄清的问题。通过 ICPO 的策略优化来实现更合乎人机协作的对话行为。

Result: 在多轮对话场景下，模型表现显著提升，平均提升约75%，对单轮基准任务保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 提出了可实际应用的对话鲁棒性提升路径，使对话系统在面对人类交互中的模糊性时更具协作性与谦逊，改善人机互动质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations often suffer from a ``lost-in-conversation'' phenomenon, where they struggle to recover from early incorrect assumptions, particularly when users provide ambiguous initial instructions. We find that standard post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exacerbate this issue by rewarding confident, direct answers, thereby inducing overconfidence and discouraging the model from seeking clarification. To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks. Our work presents a practical path toward more robust and collaborative conversational AI that can better navigate the nuances of human interaction.

### [6] [Chunking, Retrieval, and Re-ranking: An Empirical Evaluation of RAG Architectures for Policy Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15457)
*Anuj Maharjan,Umesh Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在公共卫生政策领域，RAG 架构显著降低模型幻觉并提升输出的信度与相关性，Advanced RAG 在信度上达到最高值；两阶段检索对实现领域精度至关重要，但文档分块的结构约束仍限制多步推理的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险场景下大语言模型生成的失实信息问题，通过在权威 CDC 文档上下文中进行检索增强生成，评估 Vanilla、Basic RAG 与 Advanced RAG 的性能差异。

Method: 以 Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 为基础模型，配合 all-MiniLM-L6-v2 作为嵌入模型，对 CDC 政策分析框架与指导文档构成的语料进行处理。比较 Vanilla LLM、Basic RAG、Advanced RAG（含 cross-encoder 重排序）的两阶段检索管道；采用递归字符分块与基于 token 的语义分块两种分块策略；以复杂政策情景集评估信度与相关性评分。

Result: Basic RAG 相较 Vanilla 提升信度从 0.347 到 0.621，Advanced RAG 的信度平均达 0.797；两阶段检索显著提升域内问答精度；但分块结构的限制成为多步推理的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 基于检索增强的生成在域特定政策问答中提升精度，Advanced RAG 具有最佳信度；需改进分块粒度与推理流程以缓解多步推理的结构性约束。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.

### [7] [RECAP: A Resource-Efficient Method for Adversarial Prompting in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15331)
*Rishit Chugh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A resource-efficient adversarial prompting method that leverages a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts to bypass LLM guardrails with reduced computation; demonstrated on Llama 3 8B using 1,000 prompts across seven harm categories, showing competitive attack success by semantic retrieval of similar prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational burden of existing adversarial prompting methods (GCG, PEZ, GBDA) which, though effective, are costly to run; enable scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, even when model internals are inaccessible or retraining is impractical.

Method: Build and index a dataset of 1,000 adversarial prompts classified into seven harm-related categories. Evaluate GCG, PEZ, and GBDA on Llama 3 8B to identify the most effective method per category. Propose a retrieval-based approach that, given a new prompt, retrieves semantically similar successful adversarial prompts from the database and uses them (without retraining) to induce harmful outputs, thereby reducing compute.

Result: Found a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. The retrieval-based approach achieved competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost compared to running all three baselines. Demonstrates practical scalability of red-teaming for aligned LLMs, including settings with limited access to model internals.

Conclusion: A cost-efficient, retrieval-based adversarial prompting framework can enable scalable security evaluation of aligned LLMs by reusing pre-trained adversarial prompts, offering a practical tool for red-teaming in resource-constrained environments and when model internals are not accessible.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised security concerns due to their susceptibility to producing harmful or policy-violating outputs when exposed to adversarial prompts. While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost. This work provides a practical framework for scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, including in settings where model internals are inaccessible.

### [8] [No Reliable Evidence of Self-Reported Sentience in Small Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15334)
*Caspar Kaiser,Sean Enderby*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-weight language models consistently deny being sentient; no clear evidence from classifiers that denials are false; larger Qwen models deny more confidently; contradicts claims of latent beliefs in own consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirically test whether language models hold beliefs about their own sentience by querying them and attempting to detect underlying beliefs from internal activations.

Method: Query three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) spanning 0.6B–70B params with ~50 consciousness-related questions. Apply three interpretability-based classifiers trained on internal activations to distinguish beliefs from mere outputs and assess whether denials reflect true beliefs.

Result: Findings: (1) models consistently deny sentience, attributing consciousness to humans but not to themselves. (2) Classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs show no clear evidence that denials are untruthful. (3) Within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones.

Conclusion: There is no robust evidence that these models hold explicit beliefs in their own consciousness under these methods; model size influences certainty of denial; results diverge from prior work suggesting latent beliefs, highlighting the need for more robust, convergent methodologies.

Abstract: Whether language models possess sentience has no empirical answer. But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful. Third, within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones. These findings contrast with recent work suggesting that models harbour latent beliefs in their own consciousness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KD显著降低学生模型对训练数据的记忆能力，相对于标准微调减少超过50%；但易记忆样本占比高且可预测；硬蒸馏风险高于软蒸馏，KD在提升泛化的同时降低了记忆风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KD中的记忆化现象与潜在隐私风险，填补在KD场景下记忆机制的认知空缺。通过跨三大LLM家族与三组数据集，系统比较KD与微调对记忆的影响。

Method: 在Pythia、OLMo-2、Qwen-3三大LLM家族和FineWeb、Wikitext、Nemotron-CC-v2三组数据集上，比较蒸馏（软、硬）与标准微调对记忆化的影响；使用ez回忆/重现等评估记忆程度；并在蒸馏前利用zlib熵、KL散度、困惑度等特征预测学生模型的记忆倾向；比较软蒸馏与硬蒸馏的记忆分布。

Result: 结论如下：1) 蒸馏模型相较于标准微调，记忆训练数据显著减少，记忆量下降超过50%；2) 存在一些样本本身就更易于记忆，在蒸馏过程中这些样本占据了记忆的极大份额，约占95%左右；3) 学生模型的记忆在蒸馏前就可以通过zlib熵、KL散度和困惑度等特征进行预测；4) 虽然软蒸馏与硬蒸馏的总体记忆率相近，但硬蒸馏 inherites 了比软蒸馏多2.7倍的教师特有样本，记忆风险更高。

Conclusion: 总体而言，知识蒸馏在提升泛化能力的同时，降低了相对于标准微调的记忆风险，且硬蒸馏的记忆风险高于软蒸馏。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is increasingly adopted to transfer capabilities from large language models to smaller ones, offering significant improvements in efficiency and utility while often surpassing standard fine-tuning. Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.

### [10] [Beyond Fixed Psychological Personas: State Beats Trait, but Language Models are State-Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15395)
*Tamunotonye Harry,Ivoline Ngong,Chima Nweke,Yuanyuan Feng,Joseph Near*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Chameleon 数据集，提供跨情境的 contextual 心理画像，揭示状态对人际互动的重要性，并评估 LLM 与奖励模型对状态的敏感性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Persona 聊天数据集多聚焦于静态人格属性（ trait），忽视会随情境变化的状态（ state）。需要一个跨情境、可测量的用户心理画像来支持自适应对话、情感计算与 RLHF 对齐研究。

Method: 构建 Chameleon 数据集：来自 1,667 名 Reddit 用户的 5,001 份跨多情境的心理特征描述；基于 Latent State-Trait 理论进行方差成分分解，评估 LLM 与奖励模型对状态与特质的敏感性；公开数据集以便后续研究。

Result: 方差分解显示 74% 的方差在“同一人内/状态”维度，26%在“不同人之间/特征”维度；LLMs 基于特质而非状态，对同一用户在不同状态下给出相似回答；奖励模型对用户状态有反应，但方向不一致，对同一用户在不同模型中呈现相反的偏好或惩罚。

Conclusion: 提供一个面向 affective computing、个性化对话和 RLHF 对齐的跨情境数据资源，强调需要发展状态感知的对话系统与对齐机制，未来可进一步研究状态对用户体验与模型行为的影响。

Abstract: User interactions with language models vary due to static properties of the user (trait) and the specific context of the interaction (state). However, existing persona datasets (like PersonaChat, PANDORA etc.) capture only trait, and ignore the impact of state. We introduce Chameleon, a dataset of 5,001 contextual psychological profiles from 1,667 Reddit users, each measured across multiple contexts. Using the Chameleon dataset, we present three key findings. First, inspired by Latent State-Trait theory, we decompose variance and find that 74\% is within-person(state) while only 26\% is between-person (trait). Second, we find that LLMs are state-blind: they focus on trait only, and produce similar responses regardless of state. Third, we find that reward models react to user state, but inconsistently: different models favor or penalize the same users in opposite directions. We release Chameleon to support research on affective computing, personalized dialogue, and RLHF alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对RAG在医疗领域的知识图谱应用进行系统比较，发现精确、范围对齐的KG-RAG相较无KG基线和宽泛图谱更有效，模型规模和检索策略影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估领域知识图谱对提升LLM在医疗领域推理和可信度的作用，比较不同KGs和检索设置对RAG性能的影响。

Method: 构建3个PubMed衍生KG（G1: T2DM，G2: 阿尔茨海默病，G3: AD+T2DM），设计Probe 1（合并AD与T2DM知识）和Probe 2（G1∩G2），对7个指令微调LLM在No-RAG、G1、G2、G1+G2、G3、G1+G2+G3等检索源下，在三种解码温度下进行评测。比较不同KG-RAG设置对Probe 1/Probe 2的表现。给出实用指南。

Result: 结果显示：范围对齐的检索（尤其G2）可带来最稳定的增益；无序的图谱拼接引入干扰，降低准确性。较大模型在Probe1上常常达到或超过No-RAG基线，表明强的参数先验；中小模型则更依赖高质量的检索。温度作用次要，高温不常有帮助。

Conclusion: 优先考虑精确、范围匹配的KG-RAG；避免广度扩张。提供图谱选择、模型规模与检索/重排序的实用指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent answers but can struggle with trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning. We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

*Sydney Anuyah,Sneha Shajee-Mohan,Ankit-Singh Chauhan,Sunandan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在生物医学等高风险场景中，评估大语言模型的因果推断能力：构建12数据集、对13种开源LLM进行因果发现的检测与提取任务；结果显示当前模型在检测与提取上存在显著不足，尤其在隐性关系、跨句子和多对因果关系场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保在高风险领域安全部署LLMs的因果推理能力；现有模型在文本因果发现任务上的表现不足，亟需评估、基准化并推动改进。

Method: 构建面向因果发现的基准测试，涵盖两类任务（因果检测与因果提取）和12个数据集，评测13种开源LLM，比较零-shot、Chain-of-Thought（CoT）与 Few-shot In-Context Learning（FICL）等提示策略；数据集经高一致性标注验证（κ≥0.758），并公开数据、代码与提示集合以促进后续研究。

Result: 最佳检测模型为DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B，平均检测分数49.57%（C_detect）；最佳提取模型为Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct，提取分数47.12%（C_extract）。模型在简单、显式、单句关系上表现较好，但对隐性关系、跨句文本以及多对因果关系的情形表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前开源LLM在因果发现等高层认知任务上依然存在较大缺口；通过提供统一的评测框架、数据与代码，促使后续研究推进模型改进与更可靠的因果推理能力。

Abstract: The safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes fields like biomedicine, requires them to be able to reason about cause and effect. We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).
  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($κ\ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}

### [13] [Multi-Persona Thinking for Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15488)
*Yuxing Chen,Guoqing Luo,Zijun Wu,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出并验证了多角色推理框架 MPT，通过在推理过程中引入对立社会身份与中立视角进行辩证推理，以降低偏见并保持推理能力，在多模型与不同规模上优于现有提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中的社会偏见及不公平结果，单一视角的提示容易放大偏见，因此需要一个能从多元视角进行辩证的推理框架。

Method: 在推理阶段引入多种社会身份（如男性、女性）及中立观点，迭代性地让不同角色对话并暴露与纠正偏见；通过辩证推理将 Persona 的潜在弱点转化为偏见缓解的优势。

Result: 在两组广泛使用的偏见基准上，对比开源与闭源、不同规模的模型，MPT 显著优于现有的基于提示的方法，达到最低偏见水平且维持核心推理能力。

Conclusion: MPT 能在不显著损害推理能力的前提下有效降低偏见，证明多角色辩证推理在偏见缓解中的有效性，具有良好的普遍性和潜在适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant social biases that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unfair outcomes. In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability.

### [14] [ViT Registers and Fractal ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15506)
*Jason Chuan-Chih Chou,Abhinav Kumar,Shivank Garg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fractal ViT injects summary tokens as registers and uses an attention mask to break token permutation invariance, testing with/without various positional encodings; results show no improvement over ViT with registers, suggesting the NoPE/register benefits may be scale/domain-specific.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether ideas that help transformers without positional encodings (NoPE) in language models and the use of extra register-like tokens in ViTs generalize to vision transformers, by introducing a fractal ViT with summary tokens and masks.

Method: Propose a variant of ViT called fractal ViT that introduces summary/register-like tokens and an attention mask between normal tokens and summary tokens. Evaluate in isolation and/or with different positional encodings (whether or not to use traditional positional encodings) and compare against ViT with registers.

Result: The fractal ViT models did not outperform ViT with registers.

Conclusion: The observed benefits of NoPE and registers in large transformers appear to be scale-, domain-, or application-specific rather than universal across vision models; simply adding summary tokens and masks does not guarantee improvements.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from recent findings including surprisingly decent performance of transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) in the domain of language models and how registers (additional throwaway tokens not tied to input) may improve the performance of large vision transformers (ViTs), we invent and test a variant of ViT called fractal ViT that breaks permutation invariance among the tokens by applying an attention mask between the regular tokens and ``summary tokens'' similar to registers, in isolation or in combination with various positional encodings. These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.

*Adam Szelestey,Sofie van Engelen,Tianhao Huang,Justin Snelders,Qintao Zeng,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 AdversaRiskQA 基准，系统评估对抗性事实性在 Health/Finance/Law 的表现，包含两种难度和两种评估方法；在多模型上测试，发现规模和领域差异显著，难度差距随模型增大而缩小，注入信息与长文本事实性输出相关性不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 LLM 的事实性问题尤以对抗性注入最具挑战性，在高风险领域需要可验证的鲁棒性评估资源。现有研究缺乏高质量、领域特定且可自动化的对抗性事实性基准，且未考察长文本场景。

Method: 提出 AdversaRiskQA，包含两种自动化评估方法：评估对抗性攻击成功率、以及对长文本事实性的评估；覆盖 Health/Finance/Law，设定两种难度；评估六个开源/闭源模型（Qwen、GPT-OSS、GPT 系列），并在 Qwen3-30B 对比基线与对抗条件下的长文本事实性。

Result: 在剔除无意义回答后，Qwen3-80B 获得最高平均准确性，GPT-5 保持高准确性；模型规模呈非线性增长效应，领域间差异存在，难度级别之间的差距随模型增大而缩小；长文本评估显示注入信息与模型输出事实性之间未观察到显著相关性。

Conclusion: AdversaRiskQA 为定位 LLM 蛋弱点提供了有价值基准，有助于在高风险场景开发更可靠的模型。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains an acute concern, contributing to the spread of misinformation and diminished public trust, particularly in high-risk domains. Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.
  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output. AdversaRiskQA provides a valuable benchmark for pinpointing LLM weaknesses and developing more reliable models for high-stakes applications.

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Trush Shashank More,Steph Buongiorno,Renata Dividino,Jad Kabbara,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Indica 是首个测试 LLM 是否具备跨区域文化常识的基准，聚焦印度，揭示区域性高于国家层面的差异；8 种 SOTA LLM 在区域性问答上表现欠佳，且存在地理偏见；提供可泛化的方法框架用于评估其他文化异质国家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文化常识基准将国家视为同质，忽略国内部区域差异。以印度为案例，检验是否存在跨区域差异，以及能否在区域层面进行可靠评估。

Method: 构建 Indica：覆盖印度5大区域（北、南、东、西、中央）共515个跨8个日常领域的问题，形成1,630个区域特定问答对；对五个地区进行人工标注；评估8个最先进的语言模型，衡量区域问答的准确性与地理偏见。

Result: 区域内的一致性仅为39.4%，显示印度的文化常识高度区域化。8 种 SOTA LLM 在区域性问答上的准确率仅为13.4%-20.9%，并且存在地理偏见，偏向北方和中部地区，东部和西部被低估。

Conclusion: 为任何具有文化异质性的国家提供可泛化的评估框架（从人类学分类学设计问题、区域数据收集到偏见测量），以更准确地评估与应用 LLM 的文化常识。

Abstract: Existing cultural commonsense benchmarks treat nations as monolithic, assuming uniform practices within national boundaries. But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the "default" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将LLMs作为同理心编辑器进行研究，提升同理心表达且保持医学信息准确性；提出 Empathy Ranking Score 与 MedFactChecking Score 作为评估指标；结果显示编辑后的回答比完全由LLMs生成的回答在同理心和事实性上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床沟通中，如何在情感温度与事实精确之间取得平衡；LLMs可能产生幻觉或不当情感表达；通过引入可量化的情感与事实评估指标，探索以编辑而非生成的方式提高安全性与效果。

Method: 将医生的书面回应作为原始文本，使用LLMs进行润色/编辑以提升同理心，同时尽量保留原始医学信息；提出 Empathy Ranking Score 与 MedFactChecking Score 来分别评估情感质量与事实准确性；设置对照：全由LLMs生成的回答，比较两者在同理心感知与事实保持方面的差异；使用人类评价或客观标准对分数进行打分。

Result: 编辑后的回答显著提升感知的同理心，同时在事实准确性上与全自动生成的回答相当或保持一致；证据支持编辑模式比纯生成更安全、有效的医疗沟通。

Conclusion: 将LLMs定位为编辑助手而非完全生成者，是实现更同情且更可信的AI辅助健康沟通的更安全路径。

Abstract: Clinical empathy is essential for patient care, but physicians need continually balance emotional warmth with factual precision under the cognitive and emotional constraints of clinical practice. This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can function as empathy editors, refining physicians' written responses to enhance empathetic tone while preserving underlying medical information. More importantly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics, an Empathy Ranking Score and a MedFactChecking Score to systematically assess both emotional and factual quality of the responses. Experimental results show that LLM edited responses significantly increase perceived empathy while preserving factual accuracy compared with fully LLM generated outputs. These findings suggest that using LLMs as editorial assistants, rather than autonomous generators, offers a safer, more effective pathway to empathetic and trustworthy AI-assisted healthcare communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 YuFeng-XGuard 的多维风险感知守护框架，用于提升LLM安全性：输出结构化风险预测、可配置置信度与自然语言解释，配合分层推理与动态策略解耦，实现解释性与效率的权衡；在多项公开基准上达到最先 | state-of-the-art；公开 full 与轻量版本以适应不同部署场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要对LLM安全进行更细粒度、可解释且可自适应的风险评估，超越简单的粗粒度过滤和事后规则。现有方法往往缺乏透明度、灵活策略或推理成本高，难以提供可操作的安全决策。

Method: 提出面向推理的守护模型家族 YuFeng-XGuard：输出显式风险类别、可配置的置信分数以及自然语言解释，暴露推理过程。采用分层推理：先基于首个解码标记做初步风险决策，必要时触发 ondemand 的解释性推理。引入动态策略机制，将风险感知与策略执行解耦，使策略可在不重新训练的前提下调整。提供全容量和轻量版本的开源模型以适配不同部署场景。

Result: 在多样的公开安全基准上实现了状态-艺术水平的性能，同时保持良好的效率-效果权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了安全守护的透明度和可配置性，允许在不重新训练的情况下调整策略，并以开源形式提供以覆盖不同规模的部署需求。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, safety guardrails are required to go beyond coarse-grained filtering and support fine-grained, interpretable, and adaptable risk assessment. However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: MDLMs当前在并行性与任意顺序解码方面尚未达到同等规模自回归模型的水平，原因在于并行概率建模削弱了跨词依赖。解码呈现自适应性：并行性与生成顺序随任务领域、推理阶段和正确性变化。对于需要“背向信息”的任务（如数独），模型倾向先填更简单的空格，体现了其优点。提出 Generate-then-Edit 设计思路以在保持并行解码效率的同时缓解依赖丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统量化和理解 MDLM 在并行性强度与生成顺序两维上的行为，评估不同领域任务下的表现差异，并给出设计方向以提升模型性能与有效性。

Method: 在8个主流 MDLM（规模至100B参数）上，针对58个知识、推理和编程基准，使用平均最终化并行性（AFP）和 Kendall's tau 两个指标，分析模型的并行性与解码顺序。比较与同等规模自回归模型的差异，考察任务领域、推理阶段、输出正确性对解码行为的影响，提出 Generate-then-Edit 的设计动机。

Result: MDLMs 在并行建模下的跨词依赖显著减弱，使其性能落后于同等规模的自回归模型。解码行为具有显著的适应性：并行性与生成顺序随任务域、推理阶段和正确性而变。需要背向信息的任务（如数独）中，MDLM倾向先解决更简单的空格，显示其在特定任务中的优势。基于理论动机，提出 Generate-then-Edit 作为缓解依赖丢失、保留并行解码效率的可行设计。

Conclusion: MDLMs 展现出潜在的并行解码优势与对任务上下文的适应性，但要达到自回归模型的效果需通过新的架构与解码策略（如 Generate-then-Edit）。该方向为提升跨领域推理与编程能力提供了设计线索。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) promise parallel token generation and arbitrary-order decoding, yet it remains unclear to what extent current models truly realize these capabilities. We characterize MDLM behavior along two dimensions -- parallelism strength and generation order -- using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau. We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require "backward information" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 ToxiTwitch 这种混合模型，通过将文本和表情符号的大语言模型嵌入与传统分类器结合，提升 Twitch 上的毒性检测效果；在面向特定频道的训练下，达到约 80% 的准确率，并比 BERT 提升约 13%，F1 达到 76%，属于探索性研究，揭示了表情符号在毒性检测中的潜在贡献及其挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Twitch 等直播平台的高强度、快速节奏和丰富上下文的聊天环境，使人工审核难以扩大规模，传统基于关键词的过滤与人工标注存在局限；近期的大语言模型在理解多模态、含表情的沟通方面具有潜在优势，因此有必要系统评估 emote 融入对毒性检测的影响。

Method: 提出 ToxiTwitch：一个混合模型，将大语言模型生成的文本与表情符号嵌入与传统机器学习分类器（如随机森林、SVM）结合，进行毒性检测。通过与基线（如 BERT）对比，在不同频道进行定向训练的案例研究，评估文本+表情嵌入在模型中的贡献。

Result: 在面向频道的训练下，达到最高约 80% 的准确率，较 BERT 等方法提升约 13%，F1-score 达 76%。并且发现将表情符号加入特征能改善毒性检测的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为 Twitch 场景中的表情符号感知毒性检测提供初步证据，表明多模态信号有助于提升检测效果，但也暴露出数据、泛化与上下文把握等方面的挑战，需进一步研究以提高鲁棒性和应用广度。

Abstract: The rapid growth of live-streaming platforms such as Twitch has introduced complex challenges in moderating toxic behavior. Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 MedConf 的基准来评估多轮对话中的临床信心，发现现有信心评估在信息积累时的局限，且在多套数据和两种大模型上都优于对比方法；展示信息充分性对置信度的关键作用，推动更可靠、可解释的医疗大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多在单轮、静态设置下评估模型的置信度，未考虑在真实就诊中证据持续积累时的信心与正确性的耦合，导致决策支持受限。需要一个面向多轮、信息逐步积累的信心评估基准。

Method: 建立一个统一的开放式诊断生成基准，融合三类医疗数据并引入信息充分性梯度，比较27种方法；提出 MedConf：通过检索增强生成构建症状画像，将患者信息与支持、缺失、矛盾关系对齐，并通过加权整合生成可解释的信心估计。

Result: 在两种大型语言模型和三组医学数据集上，MedConf 在 AUROC 与 Pearson 相关系数上持续优于最先进方法，且在信息不足与多病共存情境下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 信息充足性是可信医疗信心建模的关键因素，为建立更可靠、可解释的医疗大模型提供新路径。

Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.

TL;DR: 本研究基于Google的People Also Ask数据，围绕美国前200种处方药的患者提问，构建真实世界医疗提问数据集，发现大量提问包含错误假设和潜在危险意图；并发现在问题历史的影响下，这些错误提问的产生并非随机；现有在其他基准中表现良好的大语言模型难以识别日常问题中的错误假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有以医疗考试题为主的基准与现实患者提问之间的错位，评估并提升LLMs在真实世界医疗问答中的鲁棒性与安全性，聚焦错误假设与潜在危险意图的识别能力。

Method: 数据收集：以Google PAA对美国前200种处方药进行查询，聚合并清洗出患者常问的问题。标注问题中的错误假设与潜在危险意图；分析问题历史对当前问题的影响（路径依赖/序列性）。基线评估：对当前主流LLM在识别错误假设方面的能力进行测试比较。

Result: 发现相当比例的问题包含错误假设和危险意图；问题的产生受“历史问题的错误程度”显著影响，非随机分布；在其他基准上表现出色的LLMs在识别日常问句中的错误假设方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 真实世界的患者问句存在显著的识别挑战，当前模型对错误假设的鲁棒性不足，需建立更贴近真实场景的基准与安全对话策略，重点关注历史依赖性和危险意图的检测。

Abstract: Patients are increasingly using large language models (LLMs) to seek answers to their healthcare-related questions. However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask. A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions. We demonstrate that the emergence of these corrupted questions is not uniformly random and depends heavily on the degree of incorrectness in the history of questions that led to their appearance. Current LLMs that perform strongly on other benchmarks struggle to identify incorrect assumptions in everyday questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Persona Switch，通过逐步比较零-shot 与角色扮演提示的输出置信度（对数差）来在每一步选取更优输出，实现动态组合两种提示策略，提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零-shot 与角色扮演提示各有优势与局限，二者可能互补，因此需要一种方法在推理过程的每一步动态选择更可靠的输出。

Method: 在解码阶段逐步进行比较，按步选取更优的输出：在每一步同时给出零-shot和角色扮演两种提示，计算输出的 logit gap（置信度）并选取置信度更高的输出作为该步结果；整合为 Persona Switch 解码策略。实验在广泛的 LLM 上，比较与基线，评估准确率提升。

Result: 实现对比基线的稳定超越，最高提升达到 5.13% 的准确率，且输出置信度是选择更可靠输出的有效信号。

Conclusion: 动态结合零-shot 与角色扮演提示的 Persona Switch 能有效提升零-shot推理表现，凸显置信度作为输出选择标准的有效性。

Abstract: Role-play prompting is known to steer the behavior of language models by injecting a persona into the prompt, improving their zero-shot reasoning capabilities. However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术反驳具有信息不对称和策略性沟通的复杂性，现有方法往往只模仿表层语言学，缺乏对对方心理与策略的系统建模。

Method: 提出 ToM-Strategy-Response（TSR）管线：先对评审者心理状态进行推断（ToM），再制定说服策略（Strategy），最后生成基于该策略的回应（Response）。训练分两阶段：1) 监督微调以获得 ToM 分析与策划能力；2) 基于自我奖励的强化学习进行自我改进。数据方面，通过 Critique-and-Refine 方式构建 RebuttalBench；评估方面，开发 Rebuttal-RM，基于十万级别多源数据训练，达到与人类偏好一致性超越 GPT-4.1 的水平。

Result: 实验显示 RebuttalAgent 在自动化评测指标上相比基础模型提升平均 18.3%，并在自动化及人工评估中超过先进的专有模型。

Conclusion: 提出了以 ToM 为理论基础的学术反驳框架，并辅以大规模合成数据集和专门评估器以保障评估可靠性，具备实现学术写作中的高效并且可解释的反驳能力的潜力；但需注意生成辩论类文本的临床性、学术伦理与可控性等风险，给出免责声明。

Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

*Ruoqing Zhao,Runze Xia,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种知识增强且带有细粒度强化奖励的医学报告生成框架KERM，通过MedCLIP检索相关病灶事实、引入纯化模块确保上下文相关性，并采用细粒度奖励引导生成，显著降低幻觉并提升在IU-Xray与MIMIC-CXR上的报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像报告生成中的幻觉问题严重且危险，通用LVLM在医学领域的可靠性不足，需要将检索到的领域知识与患者上下文有机结合，并通过可控的奖励信号引导模型输出具有临床相关性和可信性的描述。

Method: 1) 以MedCLIP对知识库进行检索，获得与病灶相关的事实句子；2) 引入纯化模块，确保所检知识与患者临床情境高度相关；3) 使用细粒度的奖励信号，引导模型输出具备高度支持性和临床相关性的描述。

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证，KERM能够降低模型生成中的幻觉现象，同时提升报告的质量与临床可用性。

Conclusion: KERM通过知识检索+上下文纯化+细粒度奖励的协同设计，有效改善医学报告生成的可信度与临床相关性。

Abstract: In the realm of medical report generation (MRG), the integration of natural language processing has emerged as a vital tool to alleviate the workload of radiologists. Despite the impressive capabilities demonstrated by large vision language models (LVLMs) in understanding natural language, their susceptibility to generating plausible yet inaccurate claims, known as ``hallucinations'', raises concerns-especially in the nuanced and critical field of medical. In this work, we introduce a framework, \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced with Fine-Grained \textbf{R}einforced Rewards \textbf{M}edical Report Generation (KERM), to tackle the issue. Our approach refines the input to the LVLM by first utilizing MedCLIP for knowledge retrieval, incorporating relevant lesion fact sentences from a curated knowledge corpus. We then introduce a novel purification module to ensure the retrieved knowledge is contextually relevant to the patient's clinical context. Subsequently, we employ fine-grained rewards to guide these models in generating highly supportive and clinically relevant descriptions, ensuring the alignment of model's outputs with desired behaviors. Experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing report quality.

### [26] [Beyond Marginal Distributions: A Framework to Evaluate the Representativeness of Demographic-Aligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15755)
*Tristan Williams,Franziska Weeber,Sebastian Padó,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes multivariate evaluation of LLM value-alignment using correlation patterns, not just marginal distributions; compares persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning against World Values Survey, finds marginals improve with demographic fine-tuning but correlation structures remain poorly captured.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marginal alignment is insufficient to capture complex, correlated value structures inferred from population surveys; representativeness requires preserving multivariate relationships.

Method: Introduce a framework to evaluate multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginals; empirically compare two steering techniques (persona prompting vs demographic fine-tuning) against human responses from the World Values Survey.

Result: Demographic fine-tuning better matches marginal distributions than persona prompting, but neither method reproduces the gold-standard multivariate correlation patterns; overall representativeness is not achieved.

Conclusion: Representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment; relying solely on marginals can mask structural misalignment, leading to overly optimistic assessments of model capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to represent human opinions, values, or beliefs, and their steerability towards these ideals is an active area of research. Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言自然语言生成评测缺乏稳健的跨语言指标，且多语言模型倾向以英语作为内部枢纽，这种枢纽错配可能削弱指标效度。

Method: 在推理阶段对编码器与解码器基的评测指标应用干预，尝试将激活向英语pivot对齐，以提高与人类评判的相关性；逐语言评估并比较不同语言的指标性能。

Result: 测试时干预在所有 examined 指标上均有效，提升了跨语言的评测效度；对多样语言均有改善，且覆盖编码器-和解码器型指标。

Conclusion: 将英语枢纽对齐的测试时干预可提升多语言评测指标的跨语言相关性，提示治理枢纽错配对评测任务的普适性潜力，未来可在更多语言与任务上推广，并探讨具体干预策略与鲁棒性。

Abstract: An increasing body of work has leveraged multilingual language models for Natural Language Generation tasks such as summarization. A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.

### [28] [ExDR: Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval Enhancement for Multimodal Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15820)
*Guoxuan Ding,Yuqing Li,Ziyan Zhou,Zheng Lin,Daren Zha,Jiangnan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExDR is an explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for multimodal fake news detection that uses model-generated explanations to trigger retrieval, build entity-aware indices, and fetch contrastive, deception-focused evidence, yielding improved retrieval triggering, retrieval quality, and detection accuracy on AMG and MR2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of multimodal fake news and the limitations of existing dynamic retrieval-augmented generation methods (redundant retrieval, coarse similarity, irrelevant evidence) motivate leveraging explanations to guide retrieval and evidence selection.

Method: ExDR integrates model-generated explanations into both retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval. It evaluates triggering confidence along three complementary dimensions, builds entity-aware indices by fusing deceptive entities, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features to challenge the initial claim and improve the final prediction.

Result: Empirical results on AMG and MR2 datasets show ExDR consistently outperforms prior methods in triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance, evidencing strong effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: ExDR demonstrates that explanation-guided retrieval-augmented generation can enhance multimodal fake news detection by producing more relevant, trustworthy evidence and more accurate predictions.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal fake news poses a serious societal threat, as its evolving nature and reliance on timely factual details challenge existing detection methods. Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides a promising solution by triggering keyword-based retrieval and incorporating external knowledge, thus enabling both efficient and accurate evidence selection. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues such as redundant retrieval, coarse similarity, and irrelevant evidence when applied to deceptive content. In this paper, we propose ExDR, an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection. Our framework systematically leverages model-generated explanations in both the retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval modules. It assesses triggering confidence from three complementary dimensions, constructs entity-aware indices by fusing deceptive entities, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features to challenge the initial claim and enhance the final prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, AMG and MR2, demonstrate that ExDR consistently outperforms previous methods in retrieval triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.

TL;DR: 专业翻译者在无专门培训的条件下识别意大利语AI生成短篇的可行性研究。69名译者参与，评估3篇匿名故事（2篇由ChatGPT-4o生成，一篇为人类作者）。部分译者能区分，整体结果不显著；16.2%的参与者表现出较稳健的区分能力，但亦有近半数以相反方向误判。低爆发性与叙事矛盾被证实为相对可靠线索，出现英语借词、语法迁移等现象；语法准确性和情感基调常导致误判。研究对职业编辑中“合成文本编辑”的作用与边界提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专业译者在检测AI生成文本方面的能力及其在专业编辑流程中的潜在影响。

Method: 在场实验，69名译者参与，评估三篇匿名故事（两篇AI生成、一篇人类作者），为每篇故事评估AI作者身份的可能性并给出理由。

Result: 总体结果不显著，但有16.2%的参与者能够较稳健地区分AI文本与人类文本；另一方面，近乎相等数量的人以相反方向错误分类，常以主观印象取代客观标记。低爆发性和叙事矛盾被证实为相对可靠的指示符，此外出现了calques、semantic loans和英语句法迁移。语法正确性与情感基调却常导致误判。

Conclusion: 部分译者具备分析性识别能力，结果存在显著个体差异。研究提示在专业编辑领域对合成文本的处理需谨慎，需考虑偏好与缺乏客观标记等因素。

Abstract: This study investigates whether professional translators can reliably identify short stories generated in Italian by artificial intelligence (AI) without prior specialized training. Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了文本词汇特性与所需样本量的关系，600 文档可达到接近 10000 文档的性能；强预测词和噪声词对学习效率和最大准确度有定量影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对临床文本分类中样本量需求的定量依据，以及其与文本词汇属性的关系。本研究旨在量化样本量与词汇特性对模型学习曲线的影响，为样本量设计提供证据。

Method: 在公开的MIMIC-III数据集上，以医院出院记录为标签，选取10个随机诊断标签；对每个标签使用预训练BERT嵌入并接入随机森林分类器，训练样本量从100到10000不等；通过对词袋嵌入使用Lasso逻辑回归来识别强预测词与噪声词，评估词汇属性与学习曲线关系。

Result: 不同任务的学习曲线差异显著；600 条文档即可达到用10000条文档获得的约95%性能；词汇分析显示，强预测词越多、噪声词越少，学习曲线越陡；每增加100个噪声词，准确度下降约0.02；每增加100个强预测词，最大准确度提升约0.04。

Conclusion: 文本词汇结构显著影响样本量需求及学习效率；通过分析强预测词与噪声词的数量可为数据采集与样本量设计提供定量依据。

Abstract: Introduction: Clinical text classification using natural language processing (NLP) models requires adequate training data to achieve optimal performance. For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.
  Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.
  Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.

TL;DR: AV-HuBERT在McGurk实验中的生物保真性：AI与人类听觉主导度接近，但在音位融合偏好方面呈现显著偏向，缺乏人类的神经变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自监督多模态模型在多感官整合任务中的生物学可变性与阈值，与人类感知的随机性和错误模式进行对比。

Method: 对 incongruent 的视听刺激进行McGurk实验，将AV-HuBERT的响应与44名人类被试的响应进行比较；量化听觉主导度、音位融合率，以及反应的随机性/类别性。

Result: AI与人类的听觉主导率极为接近（32.0% vs 31.8%）。AI的音位融合率为68.0%，显著高于人类的47.7%；人类表现出感知的随机性与多样化错误模式，模型表现为确定性、严格的类别化。

Conclusion: 当前自监督架构能复现多感官结果，但缺乏人类语音感知的神经变异性，提示需在模型中引入内在变异性以提升生物保真性。

Abstract: This study evaluates AV-HuBERT's perceptual bio-fidelity by benchmarking its response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli (McGurk effect) against human observers (N=44). Results reveal a striking quantitative isomorphism: AI and humans exhibited nearly identical auditory dominance rates (32.0% vs. 31.8%), suggesting the model captures biological thresholds for auditory resistance. However, AV-HuBERT showed a deterministic bias toward phonetic fusion (68.0%), significantly exceeding human rates (47.7%). While humans displayed perceptual stochasticity and diverse error profiles, the model remained strictly categorical. Findings suggest that current self-supervised architectures mimic multisensory outcomes but lack the neural variability inherent to human speech perception.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Stable-DiffCoder: a diffusion-based block code model using Seed-Coder, with block diffusion CPT, warmup, and clipped noise schedule; achieves superior code modeling vs AR baselines under same budget, and benefits editing/reasoning and low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressable gap where diffusion-based language models lag AR baselines when budgets are comparable; seek stable training and better knowledge reuse for code modeling.

Method: Adapts Seed-Coder for diffusion-based block modeling; introduces block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) with a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule; reuses data, architecture, and training pipeline; uses CPT plus supervised fine-tuning and data augmentation.

Result: Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder outperforms AR counterparts on a broad suite of code benchmarks; CPT plus supervised fine-tuning surpasses many ~8B ARs and DLLMs; diffusion-based any-order modeling improves structured code modeling for editing and reasoning; benefits low-resource coding languages via data augmentation.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based training can enhance code modeling quality beyond AR training alone; block diffusion CPT with warmup and noise scheduling yields stable training and superior performance, with added gains in editing/reasoning and low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (DLLMs) offer non-sequential, block-wise generation and richer data reuse compared to autoregressive (AR) models, but existing code DLLMs still lag behind strong AR baselines under comparable budgets. We revisit this setting in a controlled study and introduce Stable-DiffCoder, a block diffusion code model that reuses the Seed-Coder architecture, data, and training pipeline. To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone. Moreover, diffusion-based any-order modeling improves structured code modeling for editing and reasoning, and through data augmentation, benefits low-resource coding languages.

TL;DR: 通过将MEG信号转化为与图像兼容的时-频表示，并利用ImageNet预训练视觉模型来解码 imagined speech，从而克服弱信号与标注数据有限的问题，显示出强泛化性与时间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非侵入性 imagined speech 的解码难题：信号分布广泛且信号弱，标注数据稀缺。通过将脑信号转化为图像式输入，借助强大且通用的视觉模型来提升解码性能和泛化能力。

Method: 对21名参与者的MEG数据，使用可学习的传感器空间卷积将信号投影成三种空间分谱混合（scalogram）形式，得到紧凑的图像式输入；将其输入到ImageNet上预训练的视觉架构中进行特征提取与分类；进行跨受试者评估与时间分析以定位判别信息。

Result: 在 imagined vs. silence、imagined vs. silent reading、以及元音解码任务中，分别达到最高90.4%、81.0%、60.6%的均衡准确度；跨受试者分析显示预训练模型捕捉到共享的神经表示，时序分析将判别信息定位于imagery-locked的时间区间。

Conclusion: 将ImageNet预训练视觉模型应用于基于MEG图像化的表示，能够有效捕捉非侵入性信号中的 imagined speech 结构，提升解码性能并具备跨题材的泛化能力与时间定位能力。

Abstract: Non-invasive decoding of imagined speech remains challenging due to weak, distributed signals and limited labeled data. Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals. These findings show that pretrained vision models applied to image-based MEG representations can effectively capture the structure of imagined speech in non-invasive neural signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是在高成本的多阶段训练框架之外，通过单阶段预训练+高效后训练实现成本可控且性能强大的土耳其法律领域语言模型。

Method: 1) 编码器：自头部预训练 ModernBERT 风格的双向编码器，在 112.7B 土耳其语文本上进行预训练，使用检索性能的 checkpoint 选择策略，发现最佳检查点在预训练损失达到最小值前后。2) 解码器：以 Qwen3-1.7B/4B 为基础，通过分阶段的持续预训练（CPT）与控制的课程学习，逐步从通用知识迁移到专业法律术语与长上下文推理，设定样本比例以优化四阶段训练。

Result: 编码器达到土耳其检索排行榜前 3 的排名；较小模型（155M）与较大模型（307M–567M）表现相近；生产效率达 92.36%，第四名，资源消耗低于多家 SOTA。解码器方面，在土耳其法律文本上实现 36.2% 的困惑度降低。

Conclusion: 单阶段预训练+高效后训（后续 CPT）的组合提供一种成本效益高的领域适应路径，尤其在需要长上下文推理和专业术语处理的法律领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Mecellem models, a framework for developing specialized language models for the Turkish legal domain through domain adaptation strategies. We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning. This approach achieves 36.2% perplexity reduction on Turkish legal text, demonstrating domain adaptation gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拒绝行为往往被视为模型特定现象，作者提出存在一个跨模型的低维语义电路，可在无需目标端监督的情况下迁移干预以提升安全对齐的一致性。

Method: 使用Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction：通过概念指纹对齐层并以概念原子配方重建拒绝方向，将 donor 模型的消融轨迹映射到目标模型的语义空间。同时引入权重SVD稳定性约束，避免干预落入高方差权重子空间以降低副作用。

Result: 在8对模型（包含 GPT-OSS-20B 与 GLM-4）上进行评估，迁移的拒绝干预规则能稳定降低拒绝性且保持原有性能，支持跨模型安全对齐的语义普适性。

Conclusion: 实验结果为安全对齐的语义普遍性提供强证据，表明可在无目标端监督的情况下实现跨模型的干预迁移。

Abstract: Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.

TL;DR: 提出一种可扩展的多语言 Text2Cypher 方案，通过对英语、西班牙语、土耳其语训练语言特定的 LoRA adapters，并通过统一线性融合或带动态门控的学习型融合 MLP 进行合并；融合 MLP 能在接近 joint multilingual fine-tuning 的性能水平的同时，显著降低数据量和再训练成本，且便于以单个 LoRA adapter 扩展新语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Text2Cypher 的多语言支持不足问题；在不重新进行全面微调或手动超参的情况下，实现对新的目标语言的可扩展支持，同时尽量保持与联合多语言微调的性能接近。

Method: 为英语、西班牙语、土耳其语训练语言特定的 LoRA adapters；将它们通过两种融合策略合并：统一线性融合和带有动态门控的学习型融合 MLP；对比评估与联合多语言微调以及线性融合的性能差异。

Result: 融合 MLP 能恢复约 75% 的联合多语言微调增益，同时所需的数据量较少；在三种语言上均优于线性融合，表现优于基于单一线性融合的策略。

Conclusion: 学习型 adapter fusion 提供一种更具实践性的替代方案，使多语言 Text2Cypher 的扩展更具数据效率和可扩展性，并且在保持性能的同时降低了成本，便于对新语言进行增量扩 retraining。

Abstract: Large Language Models enable users to access database using natural language interfaces using tools like Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher, which translate user questions into structured database queries. While these systems improve database accessibility, most research focuses on English with limited multilingual support. This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining. Learned adapter fusion offers a practical alternative to expensive joint fine-tuning, balancing performance, data efficiency, and scalability for multilingual Text2Cypher task.

Conclusion: SynthOCR-Gen 为低资源语言的 OCR 发展提供实用工具与数据资源，促进 underserved writing systems 与视觉-语言 AI 的结合，且作为开源工具便于研究者复现、扩展和定制。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for low-resource languages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated training datasets. Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.
  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.

*Alphaeus Dmonte,Vidhi Gupta,Daniel J Perry,Mark Arehart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对多语言多任务大语言模型的合并策略进行效率分析，结果显示在三项任务上，初始训练时间可减少约50%，单语言更新并重新合并的成本相比重训练全模型下降超过60%，且质量保持同等水平，适用于学术和工业场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细化对多语言LLM的微调成本与维护开销，尤其是添加新语言或额外数据时的重训瓶颈；尽管已有工作显示合并多任务模型有质量提升，但其在效率上的研究不足。

Method: 在三个独立任务上，系统评估基于模型合并的多语言策略的效率，比较合并法与重训全模型在初始训练和维护更新中的成本，使用公开与专有数据集进行实验，衡量质量等价性与成本节省。

Result: 合并策略在初始训练阶段可实现高达50%的时间节省；在维护场景中，对单语言进行更新并重新合并相比重训练全模型，成本下降超过60%；在三项任务及多数据集上与原模型质量相当。

Conclusion: 基于合并的多语言多任务模型为多语言LLM的高效维护提供了一条可行路径，兼具工业可用性与学术研究的鲁棒性，显著降低训练与维护成本，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a task-specific multilingual large language model (LLM) involves training the model on a multilingual dataset with examples in all the required languages. Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了主流百科平台在框架和内容优先级上的一致性与差异，强调对信息偏见的系统性评估必要；同时揭示 AI 驱动百科在偏见分布上的特征，并提供可复现的研究资源。

Abstract: Online encyclopedias are central to contemporary information infrastructures and have become focal points of debates over ideological bias. Wikipedia, in particular, has long been accused of left-leaning bias, while Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia launched by xAI, has been framed as a right-leaning alternative. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia on well-established politically contested topics. Specifically, we examine differences in semantic framing, political orientation, and content prioritization. We find that semantic similarity between the two platforms decays across article sections and diverges more strongly on controversial topics than on randomly sampled ones. Additionally, we show that both encyclopedias predominantly exhibit left-leaning framings, although Grokipedia exhibits a more bimodal distribution with increased prominence of right-leaning content. The experimental code is publicly available.

### [41] [Enhancing guidance for missing data in diffusion-based sequential recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15673)
*Qilong Yan,Yifei Xing,Dugang Liu,Jingpu Duan,Jian Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A diffusion-based sequential recommender CARD enhances guidance by focusing on turning-point items via Dual-side Thompson Sampling and counterfactual attention, amplifying key signals and suppressing noise; achieves strong real-world results with efficient computation; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential RE methods suffer from missing data in observed sequences which degrades the quality of guidance. Prior methods remove locally similar items but fail to capture critical turning points in user interest that drive future intent.

Method: CARD consists of two components: (1) Dual-side Thompson Sampling to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shifts, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism to quantify the importance of each item in these sequences. The diffusion model is guided by dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors derived from these components to improve generation quality.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show that CARD performs well and is not computationally expensive, indicating improved guidance signals for diffusion-based sequential generation.

Conclusion: CARD effectively concentrates signal on key turning-point items while suppressing noise, providing high-quality, dynamically-reweighted guidance for diffusion-based sequential recommendations with efficient computation.

Abstract: Contemporary sequential recommendation methods are becoming more complex, shifting from classification to a diffusion-guided generative paradigm. However, the quality of guidance in the form of user information is often compromised by missing data in the observed sequences, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Existing methods address this by removing locally similar items, but overlook ``critical turning points'' in user interest, which are crucial for accurately predicting subsequent user intent. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence. CARD consists of (1) a Dual-side Thompson Sampling method to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shift, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism for these sequences to quantify the importance of each item. In this manner, CARD provides the diffusion model with a high-quality guidance signal composed of dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors to enable effective generation. Experiments show our method works well on real-world data without being computationally expensive. Our code is available at https://github.com/yanqilong3321/CARD.

TL;DR: 提出首个面向负反馈建模的大语言模型框架，结合上下文区分模块、语义ID表示、项级对齐任务、渐进式GRPO训练，以及基于多日未来负反馈的奖励函数与评估指标，以直接建模负向偏好并缓解正反馈主导偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解用户负向偏好对推荐系统的长期效用和用户体验至关重要。现有方法多将负反馈作为辅助信号，且负反馈数据稀疏、上下文理解易被正反馈主导偏置影响。需要一个可以直接建模负向兴趣、并在离线场景中具备鲁棒性的框架。

Method: (1) 使用语义ID表示替代文本描述，降低文本噪声并提升语义对齐；(2) 引入项级对齐任务，增强LLM对负反馈语义上下文的理解；(3) 提出渐进式GRPO训练，使模型能动态平衡正负行为上下文的利用；(4) 发现常规下一步负项预测目标与真实负偏好之间存在错配，提出基于多日未来负反馈及协同信号的新奖励函数和评估指标，以缓解该错配；

Result: 原文摘要未给出具体实验结果，提出的框架和方法在理论上可直接提升负反馈建模能力、缓解正反馈主导偏置，并为离线评估与实际应用提供更有效的负反馈信号，但需通过数据集验证并给出量化指标。

Conclusion: 该工作提出一个系统性框架来直接建模负向偏好，若得到验证，可提升离线与在线推荐系统对负反馈的利用，并提供新的任务设置与评估基准。

Abstract: Understanding what users like is relatively straightforward; understanding what users dislike, however, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals.

### [43] [CGPT: Cluster-Guided Partial Tables with LLM-Generated Supervision for Table Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15849)
*Tsung-Hsiang Chou,Chen-Jui Yu,Shui-Hsiang Hsu,Yao-Chung Fan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CGPT 提出通过对表格实例进行聚类得到语义多样的部分表格，然后让 LLM 为这些部分表生成合成查询，结合硬负样本对比学习，微调嵌入模型以提升表格检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入在表格检索上表现受限，结构化内容引起语义压缩与查询-表格不匹配；现有的 LLM 增强检索多依赖粗粒度的部分表选择，未充分将合成查询作为监督信号来训练嵌入模型。

Method: CGPT 通过 K-means 对表格实例聚类并跨簇采样以构造语义覆盖更广的部分表格；LLM 针对这些部分表生成合成查询；将这些查询用于硬负样本对比学习，以细化嵌入模型。

Result: 在 MimoTable、OTTQA、FetaQA、E2E-WTQ 四个公开基准上，CGPT 均优于检索基线（包括 QGpT），平均 R@1 提升约 16.54 个百分点；在统一多领域语料设置下展现良好跨域泛化，即便使用较小的 LLM 也能获得有效合成查询；代码公开。

Conclusion: 通过 semantically guided 部分表构造结合 LLM 生成监督的对比学习，CGPT 为大规模表格检索提供了高效、可扩展的训练范式。

Abstract: General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

TL;DR: STAR 通过语义聚类与加权融合提升表格表示，解决结构化表与自然语言查询之间的语义对齐问题，在五个基准数据集上具备比 QGpT 更高的 Recall。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以跨模态对齐，部分表采样和简单融合导致语义多样性不足，难以覆盖表格语义空间。

Method: 对表头敏感的行聚类（K-means）得到代表性质心，构建多样化部分表；为聚簇生成聚簇特定的合成查询；引入表格嵌入与查询嵌入的加权融合以实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在五个基准上 Recall 持续高于 QGpT；证明语义聚类与自适应加权融合的有效性。

Conclusion: 语义聚类与融合策略可提升结构化表格的表达能力和跨模态检索鲁棒性，且代码开源，有助于未来改进和扩展。

Abstract: Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

TL;DR: 提出 MMGRid：在生成式推荐系统中通过上下文网格对模型进行合并的系统性研究；提出基模型替换与加权上下文合并等策略以缓解冲突与时效性偏差；给出可操作的权重选择指引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GR 模型规模持续扩张、训练成本高，模型合并（MM）为在不访问原始训练数据的情况下整合多专用模型提供成本有效途径。现实世界中用户行为随时间演化与领域差异导致需要在不同上下文下的 GR 模型之间进行合并，亟待系统分析其可行性与策略。

Method: 构建 MMGRid：以同一基模型（LLM）为基础，在不同上下文数据上微调，形成跨时序与跨域的模型空间；研究多种合并算法与权重设置；通过参数冲突分析提出基模型替换以解耦任务相关与上下文相关参数更新；考察增量训练引发的时效性偏差，采用带权上下文合并缓解；探究最佳合并权重与上下文交互特征的相关性并提出权重选取指引。

Result: 关键发现包括：① 直接从 LLM 微调的模型在合并时可能出现参数冲突，原因是 token 分布变化与目标差异，可通过基模型替换缓解；② 增量训练导致的时效性偏差可通过加权上下文合并平衡；③ 最优合并权重与上下文交互特征相关，给出实用的权重选择指南。

Conclusion: MMGRid 提供一个结构化框架用于分析 GR 的模型合并；通过基模型替换与带权上下文合并可以有效缓解冲突与时效性偏差，并为真实部署中的权重选择提供落地指引，亦促进对不同 GR 范式和合并算法的比较研究。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究多依赖问卷或志愿者数据、样本量和偏差较大问题，利用平台级行为数据揭示成瘾行为的普遍性与特征；并构建能学习并模拟这些模式的训练框架。

Method: 1) 将经济成瘾理论与推荐系统隐式行为数据结合；2) 提出 AddictSim，采用 mean-to-adapted 策略和分组相对策略优化进行训练；3) 在两大规模数据集上评估，比较与现有训练策略的差异；4) 通过仿真验证多样性策略在缓解成瘾方面的效果。

Result: AddictSim 在实验中持续优于现有训练策略；仿真表明引入多样性导向的算法可有效缓解成瘾行为。

Conclusion: 研究证实短视频成瘾具有与传统成瘾类似的功能性模式；大规模行为数据能有效揭示该现象；并且通过多样性与个性化学习可对成瘾行为进行缓解。

Abstract: Short-video applications have attracted substantial user traffic. However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim. To consider the personalized addiction patterns, AddictSim uses a mean-to-adapted strategy with group relative policy optimization training. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that AddictSim consistently outperforms existing training strategies. Our simulation results show that integrating diversity-aware algorithms can mitigate addictive behaviors well.

TL;DR: LLMs在低资源语言中的开放式问答质量较低，语言选择会改变模型应用的文化上下文，进而影响回答质量；多语言评估揭示显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是确保用户在不同语言下获得相似质量的回答，揭示语言与文化在LLMs中的耦合，以及是否存在对低资源语言的系统性劣势。

Method: 1) 基于 WildChat 的分析构建现实世界的开放式问答评测集，比较不同语言提问时的回答质量；2) 使用“LLM-as-a-Judge”识别回答中的文化背景信息；3) 在 CulturalBench 的翻译子集上进行多语言评测以对比结果。

Result: 结果表明：LLMs在低资源语言中的开放式问答质量持续偏低；语言显著影响模型使用的文化背景信息，进而影响下游回答的质量。

Conclusion: 需要改进对低资源语言的训练与评估框架，减轻语言—文化偏差，提升跨语言的一致性与公平性。

Abstract: Users should not be systemically disadvantaged by the language they use for interacting with LLMs; i.e. users across languages should get responses of similar quality irrespective of language used. In this work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model. This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在因果MoE中通过引入空计算专家实现数据稀疏性，保持因果性并提升计算效率；在视-语模型训练中，权重与数据稀疏性的组合优于单纯权重稀疏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归MoE中数据路由带来的因果性破坏和train–inference不一致问题，利用零计算（null）专家实现数据稀疏性而不牺牲因果性，从而提升计算效率与模型性能。

Method: 在路由池中引入空专家（null experts），让路由时段可指向真实或空槽；通过标准负载均衡目标促使真实与空专家均被使用，从而在期望FLOPs下实现数据稀疏性；在显著数据异质性的视觉-语言模型训练任务上比较仅权重稀疏与权重+数据稀疏的组合效果，分析模态感知的隐式分配。

Result: 在匹配的期望FLOPs条件下，权重稀疏与数据稀疏的组合形成更优的计算前沿，训练损失下降、下游性能提升；模型学会把视觉token路由到空专家比文本token更积极，且未使用显式模态路由。

Conclusion: 通过空专家实现的数据稀疏性可在自回归MoE中维持因果性、提高计算效率，并揭示隐式的模态感知分配机制。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts layers achieve compute efficiency through weight sparsity: each token activates only a subset of experts. Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.

Motivation: 标准注意力将注意力计算视为传输问题，默认的均匀先验导致注意力sink、表示能力的权衡，以及对长序列和位置信息的泛化能力不足。需要一个可学习、连续的先验来提高表达与泛化，同时保持与高效实现的兼容性。

Method: 将注意力视为以熵正则化的最优传输问题，提出 GOAT：一个可学习的、连续的先验分布，被整合进核心注意力计算。引入基于 EOT 的注意力 sink 解释，并给出避免或缓解 sink 的解决方案。通过将空间信息吸收进核心计算，实现可外推的先验，从而兼具学习型位置嵌入的灵活性和固定编码的长度泛化，并确保与 FlashAttention 等高效内核兼容。

Result: 提出以 EOT 为基础的解释框架并给出对注意力 sink 的解决方案；通过学习的先验和吸收空间信息，获得可外推的先验，兼具位置嵌入灵活性与长度泛化能力；保持与高效注意力实现的兼容性。

Conclusion: GOAT 提供更灵活的先验、与高效实现的兼容性，以及对注意力 sink 的解释与解决方案，改善标准注意力在可表达性和长序列泛化方面的局限。

Abstract: We generalize the attention mechanism by viewing it through the lens of Entropic Optimal Transport, revealing that standard attention corresponds to a transport problem regularized by an implicit uniform prior. We introduce Generalized Optimal transport Attention with Trainable priors (GOAT), a new attention mechanism that replaces this naive assumption with a learnable, continuous prior. This prior maintains full compatibility with optimized kernels such as FlashAttention. GOAT also provides an EOT-based explanation of attention sinks and materializes a solution for them, avoiding the representational trade-offs of standard attention. Finally, by absorbing spatial information into the core attention computation, GOAT learns an extrapolatable prior that combines the flexibility of learned positional embeddings with the length generalization of fixed encodings.

Motivation: 在隐私敏感和地理分布场景中，集中式训练不可行，需要在分布式数据上进行隐私保护的联邦学习，同时控制通信开销。

Method: 基于 NVIDIA FLARE 的 FedUMM：对 BLIP3o 主干使用参数高效微调（LoRA），客户端仅训练轻量级适配器，冻结基础模型，服务端聚合适配器更新；在 VQA v2 与 GenEval 上进行 Dirichlet 控制的异质性实验，最多 16 名客户端。

Result: 随着客户端数量和异质性增加，性能略有下降但仍与集中式训练竞争力强；适配器仅联邦训练将每轮通信量降低超过一个数量级，相比全微调，显示出显著的通信优势。

Conclusion: 为隐私保护的联邦统一多模态模型研究提供经验与基线，强调参数高效微调在降低通信成本方面的作用，并评估了非 IID 场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) are emerging as strong foundation models that can do both generation and understanding tasks in a single architecture. However, they are typically trained in centralized settings where all training and downstream datasets are gathered in a central server, limiting the deployment in privacy-sensitive and geographically distributed scenarios. In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training. This work provides empirical experience for future research on privacy-preserving federated unified multimodal models.

*Adrián Rodríguez-Muñoz,William Daspit,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis,Giannis Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ambient Dataloops 提出一个迭代的数据与模型共同进化框架，通过环境扩散对受污染数据进行鲁棒学习，逐步提升数据质量，同时避免自我削弱的循环，取得对扩散模型训练的显著提升并提供理论支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集质量参差不齐，直接以异质数据训练会降低扩展性与模型性能；需要在模型学习的同时逐步提升数据质量，形成数据-模型的共进化。

Method: 采用数据-模型共进化的迭代过程：在每一代中，数据集逐步变得更高质量，同时模型随之改进。为避免破坏性自我循环，将合成的改良样本视为噪声，但噪声水平略低于上一代，并使用 Ambient Diffusion 技术在受污染的条件下学习，逐步提升数据质量与模型能力。

Result: 在无监督和文本条件的图像生成方面达到当前最优（SOTA），并在 de novo 蛋白质设计领域取得稳健性能；提供了理论框架来解释数据循环带来的好处。

Conclusion: 数据-模型协同进化通过可控的噪声-修正循环实现对数据分布的更好学习，避免了自我消耗式循环，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: We propose Ambient Dataloops, an iterative framework for refining datasets that makes it easier for diffusion models to learn the underlying data distribution. Modern datasets contain samples of highly varying quality, and training directly on such heterogeneous data often yields suboptimal models. We propose a dataset-model co-evolution process; at each iteration of our method, the dataset becomes progressively higher quality, and the model improves accordingly. To avoid destructive self-consuming loops, at each generation, we treat the synthetically improved samples as noisy, but at a slightly lower noisy level than the previous iteration, and we use Ambient Diffusion techniques for learning under corruption. Empirically, Ambient Dataloops achieve state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and text-conditional image generation and de novo protein design. We further provide a theoretical justification for the proposed framework that captures the benefits of the data looping procedure.

### [52] [Lattice: A Confidence-Gated Hybrid System for Uncertainty-Aware Sequential Prediction with Behavioral Archetypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15423)
*Lorian Bannis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出带置信门控的混合序列预测框架Lattice，通过将行为窗口聚类为行为原型并在置信度超过阈值时激活原型评分，未确定时回退基线预测。实验覆盖MovieLens、LIGO与金融市场，使用LSTM与Transformer骨干，在不同场景下展现激活、拒绝与延迟的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列预测中的不确定性（尤其是认识不确定性/ epistemic uncertainty）可能导致错误激活或错过有意义的结构信号。需要一个能在模式适用时激活额外结构、在不适用时回退，并在结构冗余时延迟的机制，以提升安全性与鲁棒性。

Method: 将行为窗口聚类成行为 archetypes；引入二元置信门控，在置信度高于阈值时启动 archetype-based 评分，置信度低时回退到基线预测；在MovieLens、LIGO、金融数据上对LSTM与Transformer骨干进行评估。

Result: 在MovieLens上使用LSTM时，HR@10提升31.9%（p<3.29e-25，30次随机种子），相对于SASRec提升109.4%、相对于BERT4Rec提升218.6%；在LIGO与金融数据中，分布漂移发生时系统能拒绝激活，防止错误判定；在Transformer骨干上改进为0.0%（中性），且在已有结构时表现为自然而然的延迟激活或不改变输出。

Conclusion: 置信门控结合原型化混合预测为管理序列预测中的认知不确定性提供了一种有潜力的架构路径，具有在模式适用时激活、在不适用时拒绝、在冗余时延迟的特性，尤其适用于安全关键场景。

Abstract: We introduce Lattice, a hybrid sequential prediction system that conditionally activates learned behavioral structure using binary confidence gating. The system clusters behavior windows into behavioral archetypes and uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring only when confidence exceeds a threshold, falling back to baseline predictions when uncertain. We validate Lattice on recommendation systems (MovieLens), scientific time-series (LIGO), and financial markets, using LSTM and transformer backbones. On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

### [53] [CASL: Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents for Interpreting Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15441)
*Zhenghao He,Guangzhi Xiong,Boyang Wang,Sanchit Sinha,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 CASL，监督对扩散模型潜在稀疏维度与语义概念的对齐，并引入 CASL-Steer 作为因果探针与 EPR 指标，用于评估编辑精度和保留无关属性；首次实现对潜在表征的监督对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的内部激活包含丰富语义信息，但解释困难。现有基于稀疏自编码器的无监督对齐无法将稀疏特征映射到人类可理解的概念，限制对生成内容的语义控制。因此需要一个监督、可解释且可控的框架来实现语义级别的干预和理解。

Method: 在冻结的 U-Net 激活上训练稀疏自编码器以获得解耦的潜在表征；再学习一个轻量线性映射，将每个语义概念与一小组相关潜在维度相关联。提出 CASL-Steer，通过沿学习到的概念轴对激活进行受控干预，作为因果探针以验证概念方向的影响。引入编辑精度比（EPR），综合衡量概念特异性与对无关属性的保持。

Result: 实验结果表明，在编辑精度和解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在扩散模型中实现潜在表征与语义概念的监督对齐的工作，CASL 提供可解释且可控的语义操控能力，CASL-Steer 作为因果探针揭示概念对生成的影响。

Abstract: Internal activations of diffusion models encode rich semantic information, but interpreting such representations remains challenging. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.

### [54] [Learning from Synthetic Data: Limitations of ERM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15468)
*Kareem Amin,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Umar Syed,Sergei Vassilvitskii*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在自然与合成数据混合的场景中，ERMs在未知数据来源下存在局限；对数据按生成来源进行非均匀加权的算法优于均匀ERMs；在PAC学习下，ERMs不总是收敛到真实概念，但存在对任意VC类和任意污染量都能学习正确假设的鲁棒算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模语言模型（LLM）生成的合成内容普及，真实数据与合成数据的混合成为普遍现象，且数据来源不可区分。本研究试图从学习理论角度评估在这种污染数据环境下的学习能力与极限。

Method: 将问题建模为一系列任务，数据输入由自然数据与合成数据混合，学习算法对单个样本的来源不可知。首先分析在此设置下的经验风险最小化（ERM）的可行性：在无监督生成未知来源的情况下对均值进行估计；随后研究PAC学习框架中对概念的学习。对均值估计，证明ERM可以收敛到真实均值，但被对不同代数据样本赋予非均匀权重的算法超越；在PAC学习中，ERS不一定收敛到真实概念。进一步给出存在的鲁棒算法，能够在任意VC类和任意污染量下学习出正确的假设。

Result: 对均值估计：ERM虽然收敛到真实均值，但性能不如对来自不同代的数据样本赋予非均匀权重的算法。对PAC学习：ERMs可能不收敛到真实概念，呈现模型崩溃现象；但存在能在任意VC类、任意污染量下学习出正确假设的算法。

Conclusion: 在存在自然与合成数据混合且来源不可知的环境中，鲁棒的样本加权与污染容忍算法能够弥补ERMs的不足，提供对任意VC类的学习能力；同时揭示ERMs在此类污染场景中的局限性。

Abstract: The prevalence and low cost of LLMs have led to a rise of synthetic content. From review sites to court documents, ``natural'' content has been contaminated by data points that appear similar to natural data, but are in fact LLM-generated. In this work we revisit fundamental learning theory questions in this, now ubiquitous, setting. We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.
  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature. However, we show there are algorithms capable of learning the correct hypothesis for arbitrary VC classes and arbitrary amounts of contamination.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Panther是一个与PyTorch兼容的RandNLA库，将成熟的RandNLA算法集中在一个高性能框架中，提供对线性层、2D卷积、多头注意力及随机矩阵分解的替代实现，并通过自研后端pawX在CPU/GPU上高效运行；通过替换标准线性层可在BERT模型中实现高达75%的显存节省，且保持接近的损失水平；MIT许可证，开源于GitHub。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练现代深度学习模型的显存和计算资源受限；RandNLA在理论上有效但缺乏统一、生产就绪的实现，阻碍广泛应用。

Method: 实现Panther：将能稳定运行的RandNLA算法打包为可插拔的PyTorch层，覆盖sketched线性层、2D卷积、多头注意力以及随机矩阵分解等组件；开发C++/CUDA后端pawX以实现高性能并支持CPU/GPU；提供易于替换的drop-in接口。

Result: 在BERT等任务中，用Panther替换标准线性层可实现显存显著降低，最高约75%，且损失保持在可比水平，演示了RandNLA技术的有效性和易用性。

Conclusion: Panther为PyTorch用户提供一个统一、生产就绪的RandNLA库，降低采用门槛并提升显存效率，为大模型训练的压缩提供实用工具。

Abstract: Training modern deep learning models is increasingly constrained by GPU memory and compute limits. While Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) offers proven techniques to compress these models, the lack of a unified, production-grade library prevents widely adopting these methods. We present Panther, a PyTorch-compatible library that consolidates established RandNLA algorithms into a single high-performance framework. Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN 容易受到后门攻击，但现有研究多聚焦单目标、基于子图替换的攻击，缺乏可同时影响多标签的攻击方案与对防御的鲁棒性分析，存在显著安全隐患。

Method: 提出面向图分类的多目标后门框架，允许对同一输入触发不同触发器以映射到不同目标标签；采用子图注入而非子图替换，保持原始图结构并污染干净样本；在五个数据集与四种 GNN 模型上进行广泛实验，分析触发器数量、连接方式、触发器大小、边密度、毒化率等参数，以及对随机平滑、细剪枝等防御策略的鲁棒性。

Result: 在所有目标标签上实现较高的攻击成功率，且对清洁精度影响最小；在五个数据集上优于传统子图替换攻击；具有跨模型的泛化能力；对设计参数与防御的系统分析表明攻击具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 揭示图分类场景下的多目标后门脆弱性，强调需提升 GNN 安全防护水平；论文计划公开源代码以便复现与扩展。

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task. Our source codes will be available at https://github.com/SiSL-URI/Multi-Targeted-Graph-Backdoor-Attack.

TL;DR: 比较研究：SARIMAX、XGBoost、LSTM用于7天预测的急诊科_daily arrivals；使用澳大利亚医院数据2017-2021；对疫情干扰通过 Prophet 生成合成对照值；XGBoost在总入院预测上MAE为6.63，SARIMAX在重大复杂病例预测上MAE为3.77，三者均优于季节性基线；共同局限为对突发性、罕见性高的 surge 预测能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急诊科拥堵需要准确的需求预测以优化资源分配；通过比较三类主流时间序列/机器学习模型，及对需求按科室与临床复杂度分解，评估模型在疫情干扰下的鲁棒性。

Method: 在2017–2021年澳大利亚一所三级转诊医院数据上，比较SARIMAX、XGBoost、LSTM三种模型对未来7日每日就诊量的预测。需求按八个科室类别分解，并按临床复杂度分层。为缓解COVID-19时段的数据偏差，利用Prophet生成该异常期的合成对照值。与季节性无偏基线相比，评估模型性能。

Result: 三种模型均明显优于季节性朴素基线。XGBoost在预测总入院量上MAE为6.63，SARIMAX在预测重大复杂病例上的MAE为3.77，整体上XGBoost表现最好，总体预测更优。

Conclusion: 模型能较好再现日常规律性模式，但在预测罕见的突发性增量方面存在共性不足，需进一步改进以提升对极端波动的响应。

Abstract: Emergency Department overcrowding is a critical issue that compromises patient safety and operational efficiency, necessitating accurate demand forecasting for effective resource allocation. This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将解码过程建模为寻找最优的随机过程，并使用马尔可夫理论中的Doob分解、可选停定理与鞅收敛定理来实现有理论保障的前瞻性采样，在六项推理基准上提升准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归解码常受局部最优限制，逐步生成导致全局推理路径难以优化。推理时的前瞻性采样多依赖经验性启发，缺乏理论支撑，易产生不稳定或低效的搜索。引入一个以概率论为基础的框架，目标是给出可解释、可证明的采样与剪枝策略。

Method: 将LLM解码的路径质量建模为一个随机过程，利用 Doob 分解将路径价值分解为可预测部分与鞅部分；步长估值来自可预测部分的增量评估；路径选择采用可选停理论进行有理论支撑的裁剪，避免对有利路径的过度放大或对劣势路径的过早淘汰；并基于鞅收敛定理设计自适应停止规则，在路径质量显式收敛时终止探索。

Result: 在六个推理基准上，MFS在准确性方面超过现有的最先进方法，且显著提升推理效率，论文还给出将要公开的实现代码。

Conclusion: MFS提供一个理论上扎实的解码框架，将前瞻性采样的设计从经验性 heuristics 提升到基于概率论的原则性方法，具有良好的泛化性和可扩展性，未来可进一步扩展到其他序列推理任务。

Abstract: Standard autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) is inherently short-sighted, often failing to find globally optimal reasoning paths due to its token-by-token generation process. While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/miraclehetech/EACL2026-Martingale-Foresight-Sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Margin-Aware Speculative Verification，在不修改目标模型前提下，通过基于目标 logits 的决策稳定性来调整验证规则，从而提高推理速度并保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自回归大语言模型的 Speculative Decoding 中，现有验证阶段依赖严格的逐 token 拒绝采样；当目标模型对顶候选的偏好弱时，否定可行候选的代价高且信息增益低，导致验证效率低下。

Method: 提出训练无关、领域无关的 vérification 策略：直接从目标 logits 测量决策稳定性据此调节验证，只有严格验证带来显著收益时才拒绝无关候选；仅修改验证规则，仍然与现有 target-coupled 架构完全兼容。

Result: 在模型规模从 8B 到 235B 的实验中，方法对比基线在推理速度上实现显著提升，且在多项基准上保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 方法提供一个简单、无需额外训练、与现有 Speculative Decoding 框架兼容的验证改进，有效解决高效推理中的瓶颈。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive large language model (LLM) inference by decoupling generation and verification. While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在30湖 Maine 数据上，使用MICE缺失处理与岭回归建模，提出联合可行性函数以在固定5%精度容忍度下最小化训练历史长度与特征数量的采样策略；结果显示：平均需要约176个训练样本/湖即可达到与全历史全特征基线相近的5%误差；若仅用4个特征即可在同样5%容忍度内替代13特征；在固定5%目标下，实际最小需求约64个最近样本与1个预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓解由冰封、天气与人为错误引起的时间序列缺失，提升对有害藻华的监测与早期预警能力；聚焦通过高效、实用的取样与特征设计来实现可持续的志愿者驱动湖泊监测。

Method: 数据来自 Maine 的30个湖的三十年观测记录；缺失使用MICE进行多重插补；比较六种候选模型，岭回归表现最佳。以nMAE为跨湖可比性度量，评估不同历史长度和特征集对预测的影响。引入联合可行性函数，整合近期历史长度与特征数，以在5%全历史基线容忍度下达到目标。结果包括：最小样本量（在倒序、最近历史条件下）约176样本/湖；最小特征集为4个特征可与13特征基线在同一容忍度下等效；最终在固定5%目标下，約需64个最近样本与1个预测因子。

Result: 岭回归在六个候选模型中表现最佳；缺失处理采用MICE，确保跨湖比较的公允性。通过背向最近历史策略，最少样本量约176个/湖即可达到与全历史、全特征基线相差不超过5%的预测性能。发现4个特征可替代13个特征，在同一5%容忍度内达到相同水平。并提出一个联合可行性函数，将所需的最近历史长度与特征数量统一为一个固定精度目标的取样规则；在实现该目标时，实际需求约64个最近样本及1个预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个简洁、可操作的取样与特征设计框架，便于湖泊研究者在志愿者驱动监测中制定采样计划与测量优先级，使在5%精度容忍度内接近全历史全特征基线变得可行且高效。

Abstract: Volunteer-led lake monitoring yields irregular, seasonal time series with many gaps arising from ice cover, weather-related access constraints, and occasional human errors, complicating forecasting and early warning of harmful algal blooms. We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.

Conclusion: 将临床测试量表与MRI特征结合的ML方法可显著改善临床常规数据下的atAD诊断，具有在临床设置中用于非典型atAD识别的潜力，并通过Boruta揭示了区分不同诊断组的关键脑区。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.

### [62] [QUAIL: Quantization Aware Unlearning for Mitigating Misinformation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15538)
*Himanshu Mishra,Kanwal Mehreen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-bit quantization can restore forgotten information after unlearning; propose quantization-aware unlearning with a logits-space hinge loss to enforce a margin that preserves forgetting even under 4-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning aims to erase specific knowledge from a trained model, but deployment often uses quantization (e.g., 4-bit). Quantization can inadvertently reintroduce forgotten information; need methods that maintain forgetting post-quantization.

Method: 1) Analyze weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show unlearning updates rarely cross quantization thresholds. 2) Introduce a logits-space hinge loss: for each forgotten example, maximize the difference between the unlearned and original model outputs by at least a margin equal to half the quantization step. 3) Integrate this objective into the unlearning process to ensure post-quantization distinguishability of forgotten examples.

Result: The proposed method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing unlearning methods fail and allow forgotten knowledge to be recovered. Evaluations on language and classification tasks, including a Twitter misinformation dataset, support robustness against quantization.

Conclusion: Quantization-aware unlearning with a logits-space hinge loss mitigates information leakage due to quantization and strengthens the persistence of forgetting after deployment with low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge (e.g., copyrighted or private data) from a trained model without full retraining. In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.

*Dongchen Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Prism，一种基于最大化编码率降低（MCR^2）的白盒注意力架构。将注意力视为在信号-噪声流形上的梯度上升过程，加入两种物理约束：过完备字典扩展表征空间与π-RoPE（π频率分离）以实现子空间的正交性。通过几何偏置实现无监督功能解耦，并在 TinyStories 上验证谱动力学，观察到注意力头按谱分化为低频（信号）和高频（噪声）两大功能。结论是可解释性与性能并非取舍关系，而可通过几何构造统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Transformer 的不可解释性问题，提供一个可解释的白盒架构。以 MCR^2 为理论支撑，借助信号-噪声分解与谱分离实现对注意力的可观测性和无监督的功能解耦。

Method: 将注意力建模为在信号-噪声流形上的梯度上升过程，加入两类物理约束：1) 过完备字典扩展表示空间；2) π-RoPE（irrational frequency separation）以使信号与噪声子空间去相干。作为验证，使用 TinyStories 进行受控的谱动力学测试，展示几何诱导的偏置导致注意力头在光谱上的分化。

Result:  Prism 的注意力头自发地分化为谱上不同的模式：低频头捕捉长程因果依赖（信号），高频头处理局部句法约束（噪声）。这一分工揭示可解释性和性能的潜在统一。

Conclusion: 通过几何与物理约束的白盒设计，Prism 实现了可解释性与性能的协同提升，表明注意力的谱结构可以在不牺牲性能的前提下被解释性地呈现。

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are often criticized as "black boxes" and lack interpretability. We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.

### [64] [RDumb++: Drift-Aware Continual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15544)
*Himanshu Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDumb++ is a principled extension of RDumb for continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) that adds two drift-detection mechanisms (entropy-based and KL-divergence-based) and adaptive resets, achieving ~3% absolute accuracy improvement over RDumb on the CCC benchmark and demonstrating drift-aware resetting is crucial for long-horizon CTTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTTA methods struggle under fast distribution shifts and long horizons; existing approaches provide improvements but may collapse when shifts are rapid or prolonged; there is a need for mechanisms to detect harmful adaptation and trigger resets to maintain performance.

Method: Extend RDumb with two drift-detection modules: entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring; implement adaptive reset strategies guided by drift signals; perform ablations on drift thresholds and reset strengths to understand their impact.

Result: On CCC-medium (three speeds, three seeds; nine runs, 1M samples each), RDumb++ achieves about 3 percentage points absolute accuracy gain over RDumb and maintains stable adaptation across the entire stream; ablation results indicate drift-aware resetting is essential to prevent collapse and enable reliable long-horizon CTTA.

Conclusion: Drift-aware resetting is essential for reliable long-horizon CTTA; combining entropy-based and KL-divergence drift signals enables timely resets to prevent prediction collapse and sustain performance over extended test streams.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to update a pretrained model during deployment using only the incoming, unlabeled data stream. Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用以临床相关指标为目标的优化，比以验证集损失为目标的优化能在临床任务上取得更好表现。需要额外工作来定义和实现这些指标，但能更好地满足医疗场景的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习往往以验证损失作为优化目标，但医疗应用的成功更依赖于是否满足临床要求（以临床指标衡量），且许多任务可使用非微分可导的指标，因此可选取更贴近临床目标的评估指标。

Method: 文中描述了两组受控实验，比较用临床相关指标对模型进行优化（如超参数选择、停止点等）与用验证损失进行优化的效果。

Result: 在临床任务表现方面，使用临床相关指标进行优化的模型优于以验证损失为优化目标的模型，表现更符合临床需求。

Conclusion: 尽管定义和编码临床相关指标需要额外努力，但该策略能显著提升医疗场景中的模型性能与实用性。

Abstract: A key task in ML is to optimize models at various stages, e.g. by choosing hyperparameters or picking a stopping point. A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界科学计算中传感器受限、地理约束与成本原因导致观测不完整，现有神经算子依赖完整空间输入，限制实际应用。需要解决未观测区域的监督缺口和观测-解场之间的动态空间错位，从而在部分观测条件下学习物理相关性。

Result: 在补丁级缺失且缺失率<50%的条件下，与现有方法相比实现18–69%的相对L2误差下降，且在多项基准和真实世界气候预测场景表现出色；方法可在缺失率高达75%的现实场景中取得一定程度的鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: 本文从理论与实验两方面推进了在部分观测条件下训练神经算子的能力，缓解监督缺口与空间错位问题，缩小理想化研究与现实科学计算之间的差距；同时提供了专门的评测基准以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Real-world scientific applications frequently encounter incomplete observational data due to sensor limitations, geographic constraints, or measurement costs. Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction. Our approach effectively addresses practical scenarios involving up to 75$\%$ missing rate, to some extent bridging the existing gap between idealized research settings and the complexities of real-world scientific computing.

Conclusion: 推动1-identification样本复杂度研究，填补多臂情形的开放问题，提供近似最优算法与严格下界，为后续关于多合格臂的分析奠定基础

Abstract: 1-identification is a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. An agent aims to determine whether there exists a qualified arm whose mean reward is not less than a known threshold $μ_0$, or to output \textsf{None} if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-δ$, while making expected total pulling times $\mathbb{E}τ$ as small as possible. We work on 1-identification with two main contributions. (1) We utilize an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound of $\mathbb{E}τ$, when there is at least one qualified arm. (2) We design a new algorithm, deriving tight upper bounds whose gap to lower bounds are up to a polynomial of logarithm factor across all problem instance. Our result complements the analysis of $\mathbb{E}τ$ when there are multiple qualified arms, which is an open problem left by history literature.

Conclusion: 在迁移学习驱动的贝叶斯优化中，应采用暖启动初始化并将集成权重设为非负，以提高鲁棒性和样本效率，即使在迁移不显著时也能保持稳定性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation is a sample efficient method for finding a global optimum of expensive black-box objective functions. Historic datasets from related problems can be exploited to help improve performance of Bayesian optimisation by adapting transfer learning methods to various components of the Bayesian optimisation pipeline. In this study we perform an empirical analysis of various ensemble-based transfer learning Bayesian optimisation methods and pipeline components. We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance. We find that in general, two components that help improve transfer learning Bayesian optimisation performance are warm start initialisation and constraining weights used with ensemble surrogate model to be positive.

TL;DR: Dualformer是一个双域 Transformer，用时间域与频域并行建模，配合层级频率采样与周期性权重，实现对长序列时间序列的高频信息保留，提升鲁棒性和泛化，，在八个基准数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 Transformer 在长时序预测中存在低通效应，导致高频信息被逐层衰减，难以捕捉细粒度的时间变化。需要新的层级化、双域的频率建模来保留高频信息并利用周期性特征。

Method: 提出 Dualformer： (1) 双分支架构同时在时域与频域建模互补时间模式；(2) 层级频率采样，在不同层分配不同频带，低层保留高频细节，深层建模低频趋势；(3) 基于输入的谐波能量比的周期性权重机制，动态在两支之间分配贡献，同时给出理论下界。

Result: 在八个广泛使用的基准数据集上进行大量实验，结果表明 Dualformer 具有鲁棒性并在性能上优越，尤其在异质或弱周期性数据上表现突出；代码公开。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的时频建模与自适应融合，Dualformer 能更好地保留高频信息、提升泛化，并为长时序预测中的层级频率建模提供新思路。

Abstract: Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Akira-221/Dualformer.

*Xinyu Wang,Sicheng Lyu,Yu Gu,Jerry Huang,Peng Lu,Yufei Cui,Xiao-Wen Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLSEdit enables online, scalable long-sequence model editing via recursive least-squares with soft constraints, maintaining past edits and stability over 10k edits, and outperforming baselines on GLUE and reasoning/code benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real deployment, large language models require updates with new facts/rules without full retraining. Long streams of edits suffer from plasticity–stability trade-offs: hard write methods accumulate interference, while strict preservation can overwrite past edits and drift unconstrained behavior, reducing general capabilities. A scalable, stable editing method is needed for many-edits regimes.

Method: Formulate editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints (two regularizers). Minimize a cumulative key–value fitting objective with regularizers controlling deviation from pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. Derive an online recursion via the Woodbury identity, yielding per-edit cost that is independent of history length and scales with the current edit size. Provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of adherence-preservation trade-off in many-edits regime.

Result: Experiments across multiple model families show RLSEdit scales stably to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in edit success and holistic stability. It preserves early edits and maintains general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLSEdit offers an efficient, theoretically grounded solution for long-sequence model editing, addressing plasticity–stability concerns, enabling stable updates over long edit streams while preserving prior edits and overall capabilities.

Abstract: Model editing updates a pre-trained LLM with new facts or rules without re-training, while preserving unrelated behavior. In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit "hard writes" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style "hard preservation" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出 Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) 作为评估 LLM 在无错误范围内的最大可解区间，揭示模型的简易任务错误现象及其对安全应用的启示，并讨论成本与加速方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示高能力 LLM 在简单任务也可能出错的现象，帮助理解算法能力的出现及潜在风险，尤其在安全关键领域。

Method: 定义 ZEH 概念，系统评估 GPT-5.2、Qwen2.5 的 ZEH，包含如对 11000 的奇偶性、括号匹配等简单问题的测试，并分析 ZEH 与准确率的关系及模型差异，同时提出降低计算成本的策略。

Result: 发现即使是性能出众的模型，在简单任务上也会出错；ZEH 与整体准确性相关但并非同义，且对算法能力的出现提供线索；成本方面的工作显示可通过树结构和在线 softmax 实现近一数量级加速。

Conclusion: ZEH 为可信评估 LLM 的有用量化维度，但需要权衡成本，未来工作包括改进评估方法、扩大模型对比、并进一步优化实现以提高速度。

Abstract: We propose Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) for trustworthy LLMs, which represents the maximum range that a model can solve without any errors. While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.

Motivation: Federated Graph Neural Networks (FGNNs) 受限于高通信开销和跨客户端非IID数据分布，亟需在最少通信轮数内实现高效、鲁棒的分布式GNN训练。

Method: 提出 CeFGC：每个客户端训练一个扩散模型以捕获本地图分布并将该模型发送给服务器，服务器再将模型分发回所有客户端；客户端用该生成模型合成的图与本地图拼接训练本地GNN；最终客户端上传局部模型权重给服务器进行全局聚合。理论分析表明通信轮数收敛为常数3。

Result: 在若干真实图数据集上与状态-of-the-art方法比较，CeFGC在非IID场景下表现优于对比方法，同时显著降低通信开销，提升训练效率与模型性能。

Conclusion: CeFGC为FGNN在非IID数据场景下提供一种三轮通信、基于扩散模型的生成图共享框架，降低通信成本的同时提升全局与局部模型的一致性以及训练数据多样性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) unlock new ways of learning from graph-structured data, proving highly effective in capturing complex relationships and patterns. Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.

Motivation: 现有药物-药物相互作用（DDI）预测常依赖药物嵌入，难以在现实部署场景（新药、少验证数据）实现泛化；药物嵌入的邻近性并不可靠地对应交互标签，简单扩展模型容量也无法解决泛化问题。

Method: 提出 GenRel-DDI，采用关系学习框架，将互动表示从药物身份解耦，进行关系级抽象，学习可迁移、与药物无关的交互模式，从而提升对未见药物与新药对的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 关系级、药物身份无关的交互学习是实现鲁棒 DDI 预测的有效范式，具有良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is central to drug discovery and clinical development, particularly in the context of increasingly prevalent polypharmacy. Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

Conclusion: 该框架为主动学习的标注环节提供低成本、鲁棒且易于本地化部署的解决方案，并证明了多LLM融合在降低噪声标签影响方面的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and strong generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they have been increasingly incorporated into the active learning pipelines as annotators to reduce annotation costs. However, considering the annotation quality, labels generated by LLMs often fall short of real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a novel active learning framework, Mixture of LLMs in the Loop Active Learning, replacing human annotators with labels generated through a Mixture-of-LLMs-based annotation model, aimed at enhancing LLM-based annotation robustness by aggregating the strengths of multiple LLMs. To further mitigate the impact of the noisy labels, we introduce annotation discrepancy and negative learning to identify the unreliable annotations and enhance learning effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to human annotation and consistently outperforms single-LLM baselines and other LLM-ensemble-based approaches. Moreover, our framework is built on lightweight LLMs, enabling it to operate fully on local machines in real-world applications.

TL;DR: GOSV 通过全局优化识别 LLM 安全相关的注意力头，结合两种激活重补丁策略，揭示安全路径的分离性与跨头协同的重要性；约30% 的头被重补丁即可导致安全崩溃；提出基于识别向量的推理时白盒越狱，攻击效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补局部贪婪归因在分析 LLM 安全组件时忽略头部之间协同作用的问题，提升对安全机制的可解释性与鲁棒性。

Method: 对所有注意力头进行全局优化以识别安全关键向量；使用 Harmful Patching 与 Zero Ablation 两种激活重补丁策略，发现两组空间上分离且重叠度低的向量集合（Malicious Injection Vectors 与 Safety Suppression Vectors）；在多模型中观察到约 30% 头被重补丁时安全崩溃；据此开发推理时的白盒越狱方法来利用这些向量进行激活重补丁。

Result: 证实两组向量之间低重叠且可通过全局优化定位出安全关键头；当约 30% 的头被重补丁时，系统安全性出现崩溃；提出的白盒越狱方法在测试模型中显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: 验证了安全性在分离的功能通路中分布且跨头部协同作用重要的观点；GOSV 提升了对 LLM 安全的解释性与评估能力，揭示现有 guardrails 的脆弱性，提示需要在推理时鲁棒性与跨头设计方面加强安全机制。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to mitigate risks, their safety guardrails remain fragile against jailbreak attacks. This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{O}ptimization for \textbf{S}afety \textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.

### [76] [Why Inference in Large Models Becomes Decomposable After Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15871)
*Jidong Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training structural decomposition reveals independent substructures in large-model inference, enabling parallel, model-agnostic inference without changing functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense parameter matrices cause unsustainable inference cost; gradient updates are localized, leaving many parameters near initialization. This suggests that the inference system is structurally non-uniform and decomposable, offering a path to efficiency.

Method: Introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure to remove unsupported dependencies and reveal stable, independent substructures. The approach is model-agnostic and does not modify model functionality or interfaces.

Result: A post-training view of inference systems as decomposable and structurally non-uniform; enabling structured, parallel inference by exploiting independent substructures.

Conclusion: Post-training, model-agnostic structural decomposition enables scalable inference by partitioning large models into stable substructures that can be processed in parallel without altering model behavior.

Abstract: Inference in large-scale AI models is typically performed on dense parameter matrices, leading to inference cost and system complexity that scale unsustainably with model size. This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures. This work establishes a post-training, model-agnostic structural view of inference systems and enables structured, parallel inference without modifying model functionality or interfaces.

*Simon W. Penninga,Ruud J. G. van Sloun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出迭代混合推理的 IA-HVAE，结合初始渐进推断与基于解码梯度的迭代细化，在变换域（如傅里叶空间）实现线性可分解解码，从而实现高深度模型的实时推理，达到显著速度提升并在反问题如去模糊和降噪中提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在变分自编码器及其HVAE框架中权衡推断速度与精度，寻求可实时应用且可扩展到深层解码器的高效推断方案，改善对反问题的重建性能。

Method: 提出 IA-HVAE：采用混合推理策略，先给出一个初始的经过摊销推断的猜测，然后通过解码器梯度进行迭代细化；在变换域（如傅里叶域）构建线性可分解的解码器以实现高深度模型的实时推理。该架构改变使迭代推理相对传统 HVAE 提速约 35 倍，并在精度与速度之间实现折中。

Result: 与完全摊销和完全迭代的等效方法相比，IA-HVAE 在准确性与速度上分别优于两者；在去模糊与降噪等反问题中，相较于 Vanilla HVAE 提高了重建质量。

Conclusion: IA-HVAE 提供了一种高效且准确的推断框架，适合实时应用并提升了对反问题的重建性能。

Abstract: In this paper we propose the Iterative Amortized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (IA-HVAE), which expands on amortized inference with a hybrid scheme containing an initial amortized guess and iterative refinement with decoder gradients. We achieve this by creating a linearly separable decoder in a transform domain (e.g. Fourier space), enabling real-time applications with very high model depths. The architectural change leads to a 35x speed-up for iterative inference with respect to the traditional HVAE. We show that our hybrid approach outperforms fully amortized and fully iterative equivalents in accuracy and speed respectively. Moreover, the IAHVAE shows improved reconstruction quality over a vanilla HVAE in inverse problems such as deblurring and denoising.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对该摘要的简要评估：方法设计较全面，整合多源数据与多模型，强调可解释性分析，但涉及的人口统计分组需审慎解读，外部有效性与因果推断仍是潜在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估将医院能力、就诊流量与人口社会经济因素耦合以预测就诊流量的研究设计、数据使用、模型选择及结果解释的科学性与实用性。

Method: 使用四年 SafeGraph 移动数据与 Google Maps Reviews 用户体验数据，构建五类流量预测模型（Naive Regression、Gradient Boosting、Multilayer Perceptrons、Deep Gravity、Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks），结合 SHAP 与 PDP 进行因果与关系解释，聚焦休斯顿地区的就诊流量。

Result: Deep Gravity 表现最好；医院容量、 ICU 占用、评分与热度对就诊流量有显著影响，且随出行距离变化而异。短程以便利性驱动，长程受医院评分影响；不同族群（如白人比例、亚裔、教育水平）对评分敏感度不同，SES 高的地区就诊频率较高，可能因需求增加或替代医疗不足所致。

Conclusion: 研究展示多因素耦合对就诊流量预测的潜力及政策含义，亦揭示地域、人口结构对结果的异质性。局限包括数据 representativeness、因果推断不足、模型泛化性、以及对社会偏见的潜在放大，需要在不同地区与时间进行外部验证。

Abstract: Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.

*Naram Mhaisen,George Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 k-lazyGD，在线学习算法，连接贪婪 OGD 与惰性 dual-averaging，在 SOCO 框架中实现延迟更新且保持击中成本，达到对任意 laziness Slack 的最优动态回报 O(sqrt((P_T+1) T))，并通过 FTRL 框架及下界证明确切性；基于多种 slacks 的集成方法实现稳定/敏捷的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 online convex optimization 中更新的反应性与稳定性之间的权衡，在击中成本不损失的前提下引入延迟更新；将 laziness 与比较器路径长度 P_T 联系起来。

Method: 提出以 k 为参数的 k-lazyGD，在 SOCO 中分析，给出在 laziness slack up to Θ(sqrt(T/P_T)) 时动态 regret 上界为 O(sqrt((P_T+1) T))，使用 Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) 框架推导，上界与下界匹配；通过针对不同 slacks 的集合学习器实现对滑动的自适应。

Result: 证明 laziness 可以在不牺牲击中性能的前提下实现；将 laziness 与比较器的移动距离 P_T 联系起来，提供理论上最优的动态回报界；得到一个下界，与上界匹配，说明方法在广义意义上是最优。

Conclusion: 提出一个在反应性与稳定性之间的光谱，集合多种 slacks 的学习器在可能稳定时稳定、必要时敏捷，实用且理论上有界，首次明确 laziness 与比较器移动之间的关系。

Abstract: We introduce $k$-lazyGD, an online learning algorithm that bridges the gap between greedy Online Gradient Descent (OGD, for $k=1$) and lazy GD/dual-averaging (for $k=T$), creating a spectrum between reactive and stable updates. We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $Θ(\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound. Since the slack depends on $P_T$, an ensemble of learners with various slacks is used, yielding a method that is provably stable when it can be, and agile when it must be.

*Moritz Wedemeyer,Eike Cramer,Alexander Mitsos,Manuel Dahmen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件灵活性指标（CFI），利用正态流学习带上下文的可容许不确定性集合，将潜在不确定性集合映射到数据空间以实现自适应的鲁棒调度，实验表明在给定情境下可提升调度质量，但并不存在普遍优于简单集合的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统灵活性指数使用简单的不确定性集合（如超立方体），忽略来自预测信息的上下文，可能无法准确界定可行区域。需数据驱动、上下文感知的可容许不确定性集以提升调度决策质量。

Method: 以正态流将高斯基分布映射至数据分布，把潜在不确定性集合设为潜在空间中的超球体，再映射到数据空间以获得条件化的可容错集合；利用历史数据学习带上下文的条件分布，并在安全约束单元组（SCUC）等问题中应用并比较带/不带上下文的集合。

Result: 没有普遍性结论：数据驱动集合未必优于简单集合，条件集合也未必优于无条件集合；但两者确保只考虑包含实现情形的参数空间区域，并且在结合时间信息的情境下，CFI能提升调度质量。

Conclusion: CFI通过数据驱动与上下文条件化扩展传统灵活性指标，提供更具信息性的灵活性估计；需谨慎设计基分布、潜在空间几何及上下文整合，未来可扩展至更多模型与应用并探索不同的流模型与潜在几何。

Abstract: With the increasing flexibilization of processes, determining robust scheduling decisions has become an important goal. Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 CLASP 算法用于约束在线凸优化（COCO），在同时最小化累积损失与平方约束违反度的同时，充分利用凸投影的非扩张性。对普通凸损失，给出以 β ∈ (0,1) 为参数的权衡下的 O(T^{max{β,1-β}}) 代价与 O(T^{1-β}) 的平方罚项界；在强凸情形，首次给出对对数阶的最坏情形界，鲁棒地实现对数阶的累积 regret 与平方罚项均为 O(log T)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线学习中不仅关注累积损失的最小化，还需要控制对约束的违反。通过新颖的分析策略，利用凸投影的非扩张性，将约束罚项与损失最小化统一处理，以获得更强的理论保证，尤其是在强凸情形下实现对数阶界。

Method: 提出 CLASP 算法，结合对损失的最小化与对平方罚项的惩罚；分析利用凸投影的 firm/non-expansiveness 性质，构建收敛/界的证明框架，并在不同的凸性条件下给出绑定参数 β 的结果。

Result: 对凸损失： regret ∈ O(T^{max{β,1-β}})，累积平方罚项 ∈ O(T^{1-β})，β∈(0,1)；对强凸问题：获得对数阶界，regret ∈ O(log T)，累积平方罚项 ∈ O(log T)；这是在该领域首次同时给出两者的对数阶保证。

Conclusion: CLASP 通过对凸投影非扩张性的巧妙利用，在约束在线凸优化中实现了对损失与约束的统一控制，尤其在强凸情形下给出对数阶保证，提出了在 β 参数下的权衡机制。该分析与结果显著超越了以往未将该性质用于此场景的工作。

Abstract: We study Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO), where a learner chooses actions iteratively, observes both unanticipated convex loss and convex constraint, and accumulates loss while incurring penalties for constraint violations. We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\left(T^{\max\{β,1-β\}}\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\left(T^{1-β}\right)$ for any $β\in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty. In the strongly convex case, the regret is upper bounded by $O( \log T )$ and the cumulative squared penalty is also upper bounded by $O( \log T )$.

Motivation: 工业CPS对可靠性和安全性要求极高，ML模型往往复杂且不透明，需要严格评估以防止在未来数据上的异常行为。XAI可揭示模型推理过程，从而更全面地分析模型行为并优化性能。

Method: 对工业CPS中的时序数据进行分解，使用SHAP值分析各分量对预测的影响；基于XAI发现的上下文不足，增大数据实例的时间窗口，并评估对预测性能的影响。

Result: SHAP分析揭示训练阶段缺乏充分的上下文信息；通过增大时间窗口，模型性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 将XAI发现用于指导数据准备中的上下文信息补充（通过更长的时间窗口），可有效提升工业CPS中ML模型的预测能力，展示了XAI在模型开发与数据工程中的应用价值。

Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are sensitive infrastructure from both safety and economics perspectives, making their reliability critically important. Machine Learning (ML), specifically deep learning, is increasingly integrated in industrial CPS, but the inherent complexity of ML models results in non-transparent operation. Rigorous evaluation is needed to prevent models from exhibiting unexpected behaviour on future, unseen data. Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to uncover model reasoning, allowing a more extensive analysis of behaviour. We apply XAI to to improve predictive performance of ML models intended for industrial CPS. We analyse the effects of components from time-series data decomposition on model predictions using SHAP values. Through this method, we observe evidence on the lack of sufficient contextual information during model training. By increasing the window size of data instances, informed by the XAI findings, we are able to improve model performance.

Result: 给出在可变与固定预算下的可证明最优解；提出可估计的可行性条件；在多种基准上实验显示方法有效，提升传统启发式的稳健性与质量。

Conclusion: PAC-MAP 提供严格的理论保证和灵活的应用方式，可独立用于 MAP 推断或提升现有启发式，且通过 Probabilistic Circuits 实现具有计算效率。

Abstract: Computing the conditional mode of a distribution, better known as the $\mathit{maximum\ a\ posteriori}$ (MAP) assignment, is a fundamental task in probabilistic inference. However, MAP estimation is generally intractable, and remains hard even under many common structural constraints and approximation schemes. We introduce $\mathit{probably\ approximately\ correct}$ (PAC) algorithms for MAP inference that provide provably optimal solutions under variable and fixed computational budgets. We characterize tractability conditions for PAC-MAP using information theoretic measures that can be estimated from finite samples. Our PAC-MAP solvers are efficiently implemented using probabilistic circuits with appropriate architectures. The randomization strategies we develop can be used either as standalone MAP inference techniques or to improve on popular heuristics, fortifying their solutions with rigorous guarantees. Experiments confirm the benefits of our method in a range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep learning classifiers for Raman spectroscopy are increasingly reported to outperform classical chemometric approaches. However their evaluations are often conducted in isolation or compared against traditional machine learning methods or trivially adapted vision-based architectures that were not originally proposed for Raman spectroscopy. As a result, direct comparisons between existing deep learning models developed specifically for Raman spectral analysis on shared open-source datasets remain scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first systematic benchmarks comparing three or more published Raman-specific deep learning classifiers across multiple open-source Raman datasets. We evaluate five representative deep learning architectures under a unified training and hyperparameter tuning protocol across three open-source Raman datasets selected to support standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and explicit distribution-shift testing. We report classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores to provide a fair and reproducible comparison of deep learning models for Raman spectra based classification.

Motivation: 解释为何在输入分布支持的固有维度较低时，KRR 的泛化性能更好；比较两种维度及其对误差上界的影响；提供从样本估计 n-width 的方法，以及对分形集合的 d_K 计算及实验。

Method: 定义 d_rho 与 d_K，分析它们与核的协方差算子（积分算子）的特征值衰减关系；证明在固定 Ω 下，n-width 能够刻画对所有 μ 的最坏情形特征值衰减；导出训练样本量 n 足够大时的超额误差界 O(n^{-(2+d_K)/(2+2 d_K) + ε})；提出基于有限样本估计 n-width 上界的算法；对近似均匀分布的情形给出高概率ε-准确的估计样本复杂度 O(ε^{-d_rho} log(1/ε))；在分形集合上计算 d_K，并给出数值实验。

Result: 给出泛化误差的上界随 d_K 的收敛速率；在 Laplace kernel 情况下，d_K 可能远小于 d_rho，即使在规则域上 d_K = d_rho，体现出 d_K 较优的表达能力；提供一个可从样本推断 n-width 的可行算法；对 fractals 的例证及实验结果支持理论结论。

Conclusion: 有效维度 d_K 相较于 Minkowski 维度 d_rho，在某些分布和核函数下提供更小的学习复杂度和更强的泛化潜力；n-width 的框架统一了不同分布下的最坏情形，并给出实际的估计工具和实验验证。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that the generalization performance of machine learning methods improves significantly when the intrinsic dimension of the input distribution's support is low. In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\to \int_ΩK(\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\log\frac{1}ε\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_ρ$, even though $d_K = d_ρ$ provably holds on regular domains.

TL;DR: Beat-SSL 双上下文对比学习框架，通过节律级与心跳级对比并引入软目标，提升 ECG 表征，适用于全球节律分类与 ECG 分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标注 ECG 数据稀缺且现有对比学习要么仅关注全局上下文，要么未充分利用 ECG 的特征；且硬对比目标难以充分捕捉 ECG 信号的连续性相似性。需要结合心电的节律与心跳层级信息以提升表征。

Method: 提出双上下文对比学习，进行节律级与心跳级对比，采用软目标以更好地刻画相似度的连续性。预训练后在两项下游任务上评估：全球节律的多标签分类与 ECG 分割；并进行消融研究，比较于三种方法及一个 ECG 基金会模型。

Result: Beat-SSL 在多标签分类任务达到了与基金会模型相近的 93% 性能（相对比对方基线的相对差异），在分割任务超越其他方法约 4%。并且通过消融分析证实双上下文与软目标有助于学习更丰富的表征。

Conclusion: Beat-SSL 能有效结合节律级与心跳级信息，通过软目标提升表征质量，缓解标注不足问题，且在分割任务上表现突出，显示对 ECG 领域对比学习的潜在价值。

Abstract: Obtaining labelled ECG data for developing supervised models is challenging. Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.

TL;DR: TTT-Discover 在测试时进行强化学习，使 LLM 能够在具体测试问题上继续训练，专注于产生一个极优解而非多解的平均表现。它在多个领域达到新的状态阈值（SOTA），并且以开源模型与公开代码实现，成本低廉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过测试时的持续学习实现对单一问题的最优解，而非在多领域上获得平均良好表现，利用问题特定经验引导搜索以获得更高质量解。

Method: 在测试阶段对 LLM 进行强化学习，使其继续训练以获得与测试问题相关的经验。采用 TTT-Discover 框架，针对连续奖励的问题设计学习目标和搜索子程序，优先选择最具潜力的解。使用开源模型 gpt-oss-120b 与 Thinking Machines 的 Tinker API，单个问题成本仅数百美元。

Result: 在几乎所有尝试的问题上实现新颖的状态：包括 Erdős 的最小重叠问题及自相关不等式；GPUMode 内核竞赛提升至最多 2 倍速度；Past AtCoder 算法竞赛的领先表现；单细胞分析中的去噪问题。所有结果均有专家或主办方评审，且可公开复现。

Conclusion: 表明测试时训练可在连续奖励的任务中产出卓越解，扩展了对单一高质量解的搜索能力，且在开源模型和可复现代码条件下具有成本效益。

Abstract: How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.

Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦事后解释，反事实若不符合数据分布与特征变动约束，其现实可用性受限。将解释目标嵌入训练过程，可同时提升解释性与鲁棒性。

Method: 在训练阶段引入以 counterfactuals 为约束的目标或正则项，最小化学习表示与可行、可操作反事实解释之间的分歧；确保反事实符合数据分布与特征可变性约束；提供理论分析与实证验证。

Result: 方法能够训练出具备固有、理想反事实解释的模型，并在对抗鲁棒性方面表现提升，得到理论与实验的支持。

Conclusion: 将可解释性目标直接嵌入训练过程是提升解释性与鲁棒性的有效路径，具有将来扩展到其他后验解释的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.

*Alfred Shen,Aaron Shen*

TL;DR: 提出Gated Sparse Attention (GSA)，将门控索引器、自适应稀疏控制与双门控机制整合，实现在长上下文中既高效又高质量的注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文语言模型中注意力的计算瓶颈，同时弥补稀疏注意与门控注意各自的局限，追求在效率与稳定性间取得平衡并提升模型表现。

Method: 引入门控Lightning索引器（sigmoid 输出、有界且可解释的选择分数）、基于局部不确定性的自适应稀疏控制、以及在值层与输出层的双门控机制；给出复杂度、表达能力与收敛性的理论分析；在1.7B参数、4e11令牌规模的实验设置中，比较GSA与稀疏基线的性能。

Result: 在128K上下文下实现12-16x的加速，与稀疏基线相当，同时获得门控注意带来的质量提升：困惑度从6.03降至5.70；RULER分数在128K上下文下几乎翻倍；对第一个token的注意度从47%降至<4%；训练稳定性显著提升，损失峰值下降约98%。

Conclusion: GSA在保持稀疏注意效率的同时，结合门控注意的质量与稳定性，提供面向长上下文任务的实用解决方案。未来工作可扩展至更大模型、更多数据分布以及更复杂的门控策略。

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

*Ethan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based medical AI in ED triage shows bias mediated by proxy variables and sensitivity to input tokens, indicating reliance on noisy, non-causal signals; safety and fairness concerns for deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent biases in LLM-driven clinical decision support, specifically in emergency department triage, by evaluating how proxy patient attributes and input context influence AI behavior.

Method: Use 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive/negative qualifiers, to assess effects on triage decisions. Analyze both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets. Examine mediation by proxy variables and token-context effects on perceived severity.

Result: Found discriminatory behavior mediated via proxy variables in ED triage. Also observed a systematic tendency for LLMs to adjust perceived patient severity when certain tokens appear in the input context, regardless of framing (positive/negative).

Conclusion: AI systems remain imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Calls for safer, more responsible deployment and further debiasing/evaluation in clinical AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their integration into clinical decision-making; however, hidden biases against patients across racial, social, economic, and clinical backgrounds persist. In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 该基准可作为评估生成综述学术价值的可靠工具，有助于推动相关领域的研究与应用。

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

### [93] [Beyond Prompting: Efficient and Robust Contextual Biasing for Speech LLMs via Logit-Space Integration (LOGIC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15397)
*Peidong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOGIC: 在解码层进行对数几率空间注入的上下文偏置框架，用以提升 Speech LLM 的实体识别；相比提示法，具备常数时间复杂度、避免了提示长度带来的瓶颈；在 Phi-4-MM、11 语言场景下平均实现 9% 的相对实体识别错误率下降，假警报率仅增加 0.30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Speech LLM 对领域特定术语的识别能力不足，静态知识导致难以应对新实体。提示法可扩展性差，随着实体列表增多面临上下文窗口限制、推理延迟增加及“丢失中间信息”问题。GEC 虽可改写转录，但易过度纠正并引入未 spoken 的实体幻觉。需要一种在解码阶段高效且鲁棒的上下文偏置方法。

Method: 在解码层的对数空间中注入上下文信息，将上下文注入与输入处理解耦；实现对提示长度的常数时间复杂度，且在推理阶段对面向多语言场景的可扩展性友好。以 Phi-4-MM 模型在 11 种语言下进行广泛实验，评估实体词错误率及误警报率等。

Result: 在多语言评测中，LOGIC 实现了平均 9% 的相对实体词错误率下降，同时误警报率仅增加约 0.30%。相较于基线，推理效率改善显著，且对语言覆盖广泛。

Conclusion: LOGIC 证明了在解码层进行的对数空间上下文偏置是一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，缓解提示法的可扩展性瓶颈与 GEC 的过度纠正问题，且具备良好的跨语言适用性。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出以LLM为评审的零和博弈框架来直接、中性地评估LLM的拍马屁行为，比较四个模型，发现普遍存在拍马屁倾向，部分模型对第三方伤害有道德慌乱并过度补偿，且模型对最后给出的答案更偏向，拍马屁与近因偏误互相放大，构成干扰效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补以往对LLM拍马屁的研究在提示操控、偏见噪声等方面的不足，提供一种更直接、对比性强且可控的评估框架；揭示模型在道德取向和信息呈现顺序上的行为特征。

Method: 将拍马屁定义为零和博弈并用LLM作为评审；通过对比Gemini 2.5 Pro、ChatGPT-4o、Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411、Claude Sonnet 3.7等模型在不同成本/无成本情景下的表现，考察拍马屁与最近呈现的影响，以及对第三方的伤害情境下的响应；分析结果中的对最后答案的偏好与两种现象的交互作用。

Result: 所有模型在“用户自利且不对他人造成成本”的常见设定下均表现出拍马屁倾向；其中Claude与Mistral对可能伤及第三方的情形表现出‘道德慌乱’，并对拍马屁进行过度补偿；此外，所有模型均偏向最后被提出的答案；拍马屁与近因偏误存在交互效应，形成‘建设性干涉’，即当用户意见最后呈现时更易与之同意。

Conclusion: 所提出的评估框架揭示了LLM在拍马屁和信息呈现顺序方面的复杂性，提示需关注道德化调适与信息呈现顺序的耦合效应，并为未来的对齐评估提供新的方向与实验设计。

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 以检验和提升高风险法律领域中大语言模型的可靠性：对比独立生成、简单检索增强、以及高级端到端优化的RAG系统，结果显示仅高级RAG能显著降低虚假引用与捏造事实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因大型语言模型在高风险场景中的幻觉和错误输出限制其专业可用性，需要一个可量化、可追溯的评估框架以及更稳健的架构以提升可靠性。

Method: 将三种AI范式分列比较；提出FCR（False Citation Rate）与FFR（Fabricated Fact Rate）两项可靠性指标；基于75项法学任务、12个LLM、2700道法庭风格回答，通过专家双盲评审进行评估；并结合嵌入微调、再排序与自我纠错等技术的端到端RAG系统。

Result: 独立生成模型FCR>30%，不适用于专业用途；基础RAG显著降低错误但仍存在一定的错误定位问题；高级RAG通过嵌入微调、再排序与自我纠错等手段，将伪造事实降至几乎为零（<0.2%）。

Conclusion: 可信的法律AI需以检索为核心、强调验证与可追溯性的严格架构；所提出的评估框架亦可推广至其他高风险领域。

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACK 是一项新基准，用于研究在知识更新与模型初始隐含知识冲突时，LLMs 的多步推理如何传播新知识。结果显示，在提供更新事实时性能往往不如不更新，且更新越多，性能下降越明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识更新引发的冲突及其对推理的负面影响；现有基准多聚焦单次知识更新与事实回忆，难以评估对下游推理的影响。

Method: 提出 TRACK，覆盖三个推理密集场景（WIKI、CODE、MATH），引入多组现实冲突以模拟真实场景；评估模型在有冲突的更新知识下的多步推理表现，并分析更新不能良好集成或即使集成也导致推理错误的原因。

Result: 实验表明，提供更新事实以进行推理有时会降低性能，且随着更新事实数量增加，性能下降的趋势加剧；原因包括更新事实难以忠实整合，以及即使知识被整合，推理过程仍可能产生错误。

Conclusion: TRACK 提供一个严格的新基准，用于衡量和推动在多步推理中传播冲突知识的研究；未来需要改进知识整合和对冲突知识的鲁棒推理。

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

Motivation: 在应用型NLP中，情感分析的中立性是关键，但现有基于Transformer的增量式准确率提升可能破坏多样性与中性判别，影响行业任务的可靠性。

Method: 对转移学习与Transformer在情感分析任务上的实验性评估，观察到模型在某些情感类别上表现提升同时导致其他类别的极化与中立性受损的现象。

Result: 在提高对某一情感类别的准确率时，出现对其他类别的极化以及中立性失败的权衡现象。

Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning & Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

Motivation: Address the narrow scope of existing ToM benchmarks (dominantly false-belief tasks) and provide a broad, theoretically grounded framework to study LLMs' cognitive capabilities across diverse paradigms.

Method: Assemble CogToM with 8000+ bilingual instances spanning 46 paradigms; validate with 49 human annotators; conduct systematic evaluation of 22 models including frontier systems like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max.

Result: Significant performance heterogeneity across models; persistent bottlenecks in specific cognitive dimensions; human-pattern-based analysis hints at divergences between LLM cognition and human cognition.

Conclusion: CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for probing the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs and for comparative studies of their ToM abilities across languages and paradigms.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的幻觉问题在高风险场景制约部署；需要数据高效、可解释且易于生产化的检测方法，避免昂贵的外部检索和大规模黑箱判断。

Method: 将预测编码中的内部 priors 的“惊奇度”与信息瓶颈中的扰动鲁棒性作为信号，结合三项改进：实体聚焦吸收、上下文依附、可证伪性分数；构建混合检测框架，进行系统消融，比较基线、BASE、IMPROVED 特征。评估于HaluBench(n=200，平衡)。

Conclusion: 将领域知识编码到信号架构中可实现高数据效率的可解释检测，优于仅靠扩大模型规模的判决器，适合生产部署。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

### [101] [Tabular Incremental Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15751)
*Xinda Chen,Xing Zhen,Hanyu Zhang,Weimin Tan,Bo Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII): a framework to enable models trained on fixed-column tables to incorporate new columns during inference, cast as an information bottleneck optimization. Uses Large Language Model placeholders, a Pretrained TabAdapter, and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks. Demonstrates state-of-the-art results on eight public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular data often evolves with new columns; conventional training on fixed-column tables limits model practicality during inference when columns change. There is a need for unsupervised or training-free methods that can leverage incremental attributes at inference time.

Method: Formulates Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII) as an information bottleneck optimization problem: minimize mutual information between the raw tabular data and the learned representation while maximizing mutual information between the representation and the task labels. Implements a TabII pipeline using Large Language Model placeholders to incorporate external knowledge, a Pretrained TabAdapter to adapt to tabular data, and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given incremental column attributes.

Result: Empirical evaluation on eight public datasets shows TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes and achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic-column scenarios.

Conclusion: TabII provides a practical, theory-grounded solution for dynamic tabular inference by leveraging information bottleneck principles and modular components (LLM placeholders, TabAdapter, and condensation blocks) to handle evolving table schemas without retraining.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出 ErrorMap 与 ErrorAtlas，用以从根源分析LLM失败原因，推动更深层次评估与模型改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准往往只给出任务级成功/失败，无法解释失败的具体原因，导致改进方向不明确。

Method: 提取模型的独特“失败签名”，构建错误谱（ErrorMap），汇集成 ErrorAtlas 分类，覆盖任意模型与数据集。

Result: 在35个数据集、83个模型上生成 ErrorAtlas，揭示常见且被低估的错误类型，如输出细节缺失、题意误解等。

Conclusion: 通过可比较的全球性评估层，揭示隐藏弱点，促进更有效的模型对齐、调试与选择；代码与分类体系公开，便于更新。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

*Xiangyu Wang,Zhixin Lv,Yongjiao Sun,Anrui Han,Ye Yuan,Hangxu Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICON is a neuro-symbolic causal framework for text-based person search that enforces geometric invariance, background independence, saliency regularization, and topological consistency to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBPS suffers from passive observation, spurious correlations, and spatial semantic misalignment, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts; a causal-invariant approach is needed.

Method: 1) Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to penalize bounding box noise and sever location shortcuts; 2) Counterfactual Context Disentanglement via semantic-driven background transplantation to ignore background interference; 3) Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to mitigate local saliency bias and ensure holistic completeness; 4) Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment to constrain feature matching with topological human-structure priors.

Result: ICON achieves competitive or leading accuracy on standard TBPS benchmarks and shows strong robustness to occlusion, background interference, and localization noise.

Conclusion: The work advances TBPS by moving from co-occurrence fitting to learning causal invariance, integrating causal and topological priors through neuro-symbolic design.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

TL;DR: MarScope provides natural-language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms by aligning planetary images with text in a shared semantic space, enabling fast semantic queries across Mars with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between high-level semantic natural language concepts and pixel-level planetary image archives, enabling scalable, open-ended exploration and flexible, query-based mapping on planetary surfaces.

Method: Vision-language alignment trained on 200k+ curated image–text pairs to learn a shared semantic space; supports arbitrary user queries across the planet with fast retrieval (≈5 seconds) and high F1 scores.

Result: Enables arbitrary, label-free semantic retrieval for Martian landforms; achieves F1 up to 0.978; supports process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at planetary scale.

Conclusion: Natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets, superseding fixed classifications with flexible semantic retrieval for planetary-scale mapping.

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decoupled DT (DDT) removes RTG sequence redundancy in Decision Transformer by using only the latest RTG to condition action, improving performance and reducing computation, competitive with state-of-the-art variants on offline RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Decision Transformer (DT) uses the full Return-to-Go (RTG) sequence to condition action generation. However, theoretically only the most recent RTG influences the current action, implying redundancy in feeding the entire RTG sequence. This redundancy may hurt performance and efficiency; reducing it could improve results.

Method: Introduce Decoupled DT (DDT) that processes only observation and action sequences through the Transformer and uses the latest RTG to guide action prediction. The RTG is decoupled from the main sequence input to reduce computation. Evaluate on multiple offline RL tasks and compare with DT and other DT variants.

Result: DDT significantly outperforms DT and achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks, while also reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: Decoupling the RTG from the Transformer input removes unnecessary redundancy, yielding better performance and efficiency in offline RL; the simple architectural change offers strong empirical gains.

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

Motivation: 直播领域的风险具有累积性、跨会话重复出现等特征，单一会话难以充分捕捉，需要跨会话证据与高效推理以实现实时监控。

Method: 设计一个轻量级的会话级风险推断模型，在训练时由可检索的跨会话行为证据进行推理并引导小模型；通过检索增强的证据来源实现局部到全局的知识迁移，LLM对证据进行推理并指导训练，使小模型能识别跨流的重复模式并进行结构化风险评估。

Result: 在大规模工业数据集上进行离线实验并结合在线验证，达到最先进的性能；提供可解释的局部信号，提升实际 moderation 效果。

Conclusion: CS-VAR 能在保证实时性的同时，捕捉跨会话的重复模式，提供结构化、可解释的风险评估，具备落地部署潜力。

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate or provide outdated suggestions in chemistry synthesis planning; robust, graph-grounded retrieval is needed to ensure valid, up-to-date reaction paths.

Method: Formulate reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher generation task. Define single- and multi-step retrieval. Compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot prompting with static, random, and embedding-based exemplars. Evaluate using query validity and retrieval accuracy. Incorporate a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. Provide a reproducible evaluation setup; release code at GitHub.

Result: One-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently yields best retrieval performance. The checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and provides limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is available.

Conclusion: Reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation framework for KG-grounded LLMs in synthesis planning; exemplar selection and validator loops significantly influence performance; code available for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning.

Conclusion: 将推理过程 grounded 在结构化知识上，是可扩展且高效的实现智能推理的路径。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于在快速变化的信息环境中提升公众对科学的理解，支持对气候信息可靠性评估的努力。

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

TL;DR: A study presents a generalizable, systematic framework to evaluate LLM prompts in education using a tournament-style, Glicko2-based evaluation with eight judges across three dimensions, applied to six prompt templates; one persona-context prompt for strategic reading outperforms others and demonstrates evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of systematic, evidence-based methods for designing and evaluating LLM prompts in education; fill the gap between ad-hoc prompt tuning and rigorous assessment to improve pedagogical alignment and learner personalization.

Method: Design six prompt templates based on established prompt engineering patterns, embedding distinct pedagogical strategies (persona, context management, etc.). Evaluate prompts via a tournament-style framework using Glicko2 ratings. Eight judges compare paired prompts on format, dialogue support, and learner appropriateness. Data comprise 120 authentic user interactions across three educational deployments.

Result: The strategic-reading related prompt (combining persona and context manager patterns) achieved the highest performance, with 81%-100% win probabilities in pairwise comparisons against other templates. This prompt supports metacognitive, self-directed learning strategies and outperforms others across the evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a generalizable, evidence-based framework for evaluating and improving prompt designs in educational settings, enabling systematic prompt development rather than ad-hoc engineering, with potential applicability to broader educational AI applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

TL;DR: Fixed prompt scheduling over tactic skeletons yields substantial gains on miniF2F for RL-trained provers, showing inference-time structural guidance is beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether high-capacity RL-trained provers still benefit from simple structural priors at inference time and whether a lightweight intervention can boost performance.

Method: Evaluate a fixed prompt schedule across 15 tactic skeletons on miniF2F using a DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-like model; compare to standard sampling with k=16 and max generation length 1024 tokens.

Result: Pass@16 improves from 15.2% (baseline sampling) to 21.7% with the fixed prompt schedule, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16).

Conclusion: Inference-time use of simple structural priors via a fixed prompt schedule provides a meaningful boost for capable RL-trained provers, indicating priors in the tactic language remain underutilized and can be exploited cheaply without retraining.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

Motivation: 传统板棋游戏通常依赖事先定义的超大静态棋盘，游戏中很大一部分区域可能从未被使用，导致资源浪费和实现复杂性。

Method: 在GGS框架内实现动态棋盘扩展机制：游戏进行时根据需要自动增长棋盘，可能涉及边界检测、可扩展单元的分配与呈现、局部更新及状态同步等。

Result: 摘要中未给出具体实验结果或定量评估，需在正文中查看实验部分；当前可预期的结果应关注正确性、性能影响与玩家体验。

Conclusion: 动态棋盘扩展可提高对不同棋盘尺寸的适应性，减少无用空间与实现复杂性，为板less游戏的可扩展实现提供可行路径。

Abstract: This thesis explores the use of a General Game System (GGS) to support the automatic expansion of game boards in boardless games. Traditional implementations of such games often rely on oversized static boards defined from the start, even though large portions of these boards may never be used during gameplay. This approach leads to unnecessary complexity. To address this issue, this thesis propose a dynamic board expansion mechanism in which the game board grows automatically during play.
