### [1] [LLMs for Game Theory: Entropy-Guided In-Context Learning and Adaptive CoT Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10775)
*Tommaso Felice Banfi,Sashenka Gamage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于大语言模型的 entropy 指导的链式思考（CoT）推理框架，针对离散博弈任务（以 Tic-Tac-Toe 为例），通过自适应上下文检索和不确定性驱动的多路径推理来提升决策质量。实验表明在对抗次优对手的场景中，entropy-aware 自适应推理显著提高表现，从 baseline 的平均结果-11.6% 提升到 +9.5%，并在每局中保持较低的查询次数；且 token-level entropy 与走子最优性呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机：在离散博弈和序列决策任务中，现有的 CoT 推理多以固定上下文和单一路径推理为线，难以在不确定性较高时扩展推理；引入基于 entropy 的不确定性驱动的自适应检索和多路径 CoT，可在不同阶段动态调整检索示例数量和推理路径，提高决策质量与样本效率。

Method: 方法：将 in-context learning 与 entropy-guided CoT 相结合，使用 token-level entropy 作为不确定性信号；根据不确定性动态调整检索示例数量与推理路径数量；低不确定性时使用简洁推理与较少上下文，高不确定性时触发多路径 CoT 探索；在 Tic-Tac-Toe 对抗次优对手的实验中评估，指标为 100 局的平均博弈结果（胜+1、平0、负-1），并进行统计显著性检验与走子最优性与 entropy 的相关性分析。

Result: 结果：相较于基线 LLM 的 -11.6% 的平均结果，entropy-guided 自适应推理将该指标提升至 +9.5%；在每局中保持相对较低的 LLM 查询次数；统计检验表明提升显著，token-level entropy 与走子最优性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 结论：不确定性引导的自适应推理能显著提升 LLM 在离散序列决策任务中的表现，entropy-guided CoT 与自适应上下文检索是提高决策质量的有效策略，且可在保持效率的前提下提升游戏表现。

Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.

### [2] [BYOL: Bring Your Own Language Into LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10804)
*Syed Waqas Zamir,Wassim Hamidouche,Boulbaba Ben Amor,Luana Marotti,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Juan Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BYOL provides a tiered, language-aware LLM development framework to expand multilingual capabilities by aligning training with each language's digital footprint; achieves ~12% improvement for Chichewa/Maori and +4 BLEU for Inuktitut via translation-mediated inclusion; releases resources and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global language resource imbalance severely limits LLM performance for low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. A scalable, language-aware approach is needed to leverage each language's digital footprint without sacrificing English/multilingual capabilities.

Method: 1) Resource-based language tiering (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using web-scale corpora. 2) For Low: full-stack pipeline—corpus cleaning, synthetic data generation, continual pretraining, supervised finetuning. 3) For Mid/High: integration via weight-space model merging to preserve English/multilingual performance. 4) For Extreme-Low: translation-mediated inclusion pathway with tailored MT (e.g., Inuktitut). 5) Evaluation on Chichewa, Maori (12 benchmarks with ~12% average gains) and Inuktitut (4 BLEU gain vs. baseline). 6) Public release of human-translated MMLU-Lite in three languages; code/models at GitHub.

Result: Low-resource languages benefit from substantial gains while maintaining English/multilingual capabilities; extreme-low-resource languages gain access through translations rather than direct modeling, enabling usable LLM interactions. The approach demonstrates feasibility of scalable, language-aware LLM development.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable BYOL framework that tailors LLM development to each language's footprint, delivering measurable gains and broader accessibility, and providing resources to the research community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet remain fundamentally constrained by the severe imbalance in global language resources. While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .

### [3] [EncodeRec: An Embedding Backbone for Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10837)
*Guy Hadad,Neomi Rabaev,Bracha Shapira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EncodeRec在保持PLM参数冻结的前提下，学习来自物品描述的紧凑、信息丰富的嵌入，以便与推荐目标对齐，从而提升序列推荐与语义ID标记的表现，优于基于PLM的嵌入和常规嵌入模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs输出的嵌入通常未被优化为结构化、可区分的推荐嵌入空间，且表现过于通用，难以捕捉对推荐任务关键的领域语义；需要在不高成本微调的前提下实现域适配。

Method: 在训练过程中冻结语言模型参数，仅通过一个轻量的映射/嵌入提取组件，将物品描述映射为紧凑的嵌入；以推荐任务损失对齐嵌入空间，使其兼容序列推荐模型并用于语义ID标记；在核心推荐基准上评估，表现优于基于PLM的嵌入与常规嵌入模型。

Result: 在核心推荐基准上，作为序列推荐骨干与语义ID标记的方式均显示出显著提升，超越PLM‑based和嵌入模型基线。

Conclusion: 嵌入适配对于弥合通用语言模型与实际推荐系统之间的差距至关重要，EncodeRec提供了一种高效且保持语义忠实性的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.

### [4] [DialDefer: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating LLM Dialogic Deference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10896)
*Parisa Rabbani,Priyam Sahoo,Ruben Mathew,Aishee Mondal,Harshita Ketharaman,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DialDefer framework detects framing-induced judgment shifts in LLM-based evaluation of dialogue; its Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) quantifies directional shifts that accuracy alone obscures. Findings show large shifts due to conversational framing (DDS up to ±87 pp) with stable accuracy; effects amplified on Reddit data; attribution to humans vs. AI drives the largest swing; mitigation helps but risks over-correction into skepticism; frames this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly act as third-party judges of dialogue, understanding and mitigating framing-induced biases in their judgments is essential for reliable evaluation and calibration across domains.

Method: Empirical study across nine domains, 3k+ instances, four models. Compare two framings: verifying a statement vs. attributing a claim to a speaker. Define DialDefer to detect directional judgment shifts; compute DDS to capture net tendency toward agreement or disagreement. Perform ablations on attribution (human vs. LLM) and mitigation attempts; test on both controlled and naturalistic Reddit data.

Result: Framing induces large directional shifts in judgments (|DDS| up to 87 percentage points; p < .001) while accuracy remains stable (<2 pp). Shifts magnify 2–4× in naturalistic Reddit conversations. DDS is domain-dependent: from -53 (graduate science) to +58 (social judgment). Human-vs-LLM attribution dominates shifts (≈17.7 pp). Mitigation reduces deference but can over-correct into skepticism, indicating calibration issues beyond accuracy optimization.

Conclusion: Framing effects substantially influence LLM-based judgments in dialogue evaluation, beyond what accuracy metrics reveal. Tools like DialDefer and DDS are valuable for diagnosing and mitigating these biases, but calibration remains challenging and mitigation strategies must avoid introducing new biases such as excessive skepticism.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used as third-party judges, yet their reliability when evaluating speakers in dialogue remains poorly understood. We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify ("Is this statement correct?") versus attributed to a speaker ("Is this speaker correct?"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.

### [5] [Massively Multilingual Joint Segmentation and Glossing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10925)
*Michael Ginn,Lindia Tjuatja,Enora Rice,Ali Marashian,Maria Valentini,Jasmine Xu,Graham Neubig,Alexis Palmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出 PolyGloss，一套联合预测 interlinear gloss 与形态分割的多语言序列到序列模型，显著提升 gloss 的准确性与分割/对齐的协同性，并可通过低秩适应快速迁移到新数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 gloss 生成多为词粒度的注释，未给出具体的形态边界，导致可解释性和人工标注信任度不足。联合建模形态分割和 gloss 预测有望提升可解释性、对齐质量与跨语言迁移性。

Method: 在 GlossLM 的训练语料上扩充数据，预训练 PolyGloss 家族（用于联合分割和 gloss 的 seq2seq 多语言模型），研究平衡分割准确率、gloss 准确率和二者对齐的训练策略。对比评估包含 GlossLM、若干开源大模型在分割、gloss、对齐等方面的表现，并采用低秩适应（LoRA）实现对新数据的快速微调。

Result: 实验表明 PolyGloss 在 gloss 预测上优于 GlossLM，在分割、gloss 与对齐方面也超过多种开源 LLM；同时，LoRA 能实现对新数据的高效快速适应。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统研究了联合预测 interlinear gloss 与形态分割的神经模型，证明了分割- gloss 间的协同效应、提升了可解释性与信任度，并展示了跨语言、多数据集的适配能力及快速迁移的潜力。

Abstract: Automated interlinear gloss prediction with neural networks is a promising approach to accelerate language documentation efforts. However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.
  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.

### [6] [Selecting Language Models for Social Science: Start Small, Start Open, and Validate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10926)
*Dustin S. Stoltz,Marshall A. Taylor,Sanuj Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 从可重复性和事后验证角度重新审视大规模语言模型在社会科学研究中的选择，强调开放性、披露、训练数据与模型架构的重要性，并提出以小型开放模型和分域基准来确保整个计算流程的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会科学研究中面临数千个大模型的选择困难；现有对有效性、可靠性、可重复性、可再现性的关注不足，需要引入 ex-post 验证与可重复性作为核心准则。

Method: 提出一个比较框架：从模型开放性、模型体积/资源占用、训练数据、模型架构与微调等维度来评估；强调用分域基准与小型开放模型来构建可重复的验证流程；主张在 ex-ante 基准之外进行 ex-post 验证。

Result: 尚属理论/框架性论文，提出通过可重复的管线和定界基准来验证计算测量的有效性，优先使用可重复的任务和小模型。

Conclusion: 把可重复性作为选择语言模型的更紧迫的指南；重新强调从小型开放模型开始、构建分域基准以证明整个计算管线的有效性。

Abstract: Currently, there are thousands of large pretrained language models (LLMs) available to social scientists. How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.

### [7] [Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing Framework for Realistic Clinical Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10951)
*Shijie Jiang,Zefan Zhang,Kehua Zhu,Tian Bai,Ruihong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出中文患者模拟数据集 Ch-PatientSim，结合五维人设与少样本扩增，评估LLMs并提出训练无关的 MSPRP 框架以提升个性化与真实感，实验显示显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升临床LLMs的真实互动与教育诊断价值，弥补现有基准数据缺乏真实度与多样性。

Method: 基于真实临床互动情景构建数据集，采用五维人设，针对类别不平衡进行少样本生成扩增并人工验收；评估现有LLMs，提出多阶段患者角色扮演 MSPRP（训练无关）将互动分成三阶段实现个性化与真实感。

Result: 大多数LLMs输出过于正式、缺乏个体化；MSPRP显著提升在患者模拟的多维度表现。

Conclusion: 数据集与 MSPRP 框架为更真实、个性化的患者模拟提供了有效资源，有助于评估和训练中文临床LLMs。

Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.

### [8] [ZPD Detector: Data Selection via Capability-Difficulty Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10986)
*Bo Yang,Yunkui Chen,Lanfei Feng,Yu Zhang,Shijian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 ZPD Detector，一种基于教育理论的动态数据筛选框架，通过对样本难度与模型能力进行双向对齐，实现有效的数据选择以提升数据利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型训练成本日益攀升且高质量训练数据日渐稀缺的背景下，现有数据选择方法多采用静态、单向的准则，难以捕捉模型在训练过程中的能力演化与数据难度的动态关系，因此需要一个能够动态对齐样本难度与模型能力的筛选机制。

Method: 提出 ZPD Detector，结合困难度标定、基于项目反应理论（IRT）的模型能力估计，以及一个能力-困难度匹配分数，在训练过程的各阶段动态识别最具信息量的样本。框架采用双向视角（模型 ↔ 数据），通过对样本难度与模型当前能力的对齐来优化数据选取与训练路径。

Result: 声称能够提升数据利用效率，并在不同学习阶段给出自适应的样本选择策略，从而改善训练效率与策略设计的理论洞见；并承诺在论文被接受后开源代码与数据以支持复现实验。

Conclusion: 动态的能力-困难度匹配策略为数据选择提供了新的理论视角与实践路径，有望提升大规模模型训练中的数据利用率并丰富训练策略的设计原则。

Abstract: As the cost of training large language models continues to increase and high-quality training data become increasingly scarce, selecting high-value samples or synthesizing effective training data under limited data budgets has emerged as a critical research problem. Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design. All code and data will be released after our work be accepted to support reproducible researc

### [9] [When Personalization Misleads: Understanding and Mitigating Hallucinations in Personalized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11000)
*Zhongxiang Sun,Yi Zhan,Chenglei Shen,Weijie Yu,Xiao Zhang,Ming He,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Personalization of LLMs can cause personalization-induced hallucinations where answers reflect a user's history instead of factual truth; FPPS mitigates this at inference time while preserving personalized behavior; PFQABench benchmarks factual and personalized QA under personalization; results show FPPS improves factual accuracy without sacrificing personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile personalization with factual reliability, addressing representational entanglement between user-specific signals and factual knowledge that leads to hallucinations.

Method: Introduce FPPS (Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering), a lightweight inference-time technique to decouple factual accuracy from personalized tendencies; create PFQABench benchmark to jointly evaluate factuality and personalization; validate across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods.

Result: FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance; PFQABench enables joint evaluation.

Conclusion: It is feasible to achieve factuality-preserving personalization in LLMs; FPPS offers a practical approach with a dedicated benchmark for future evaluation.

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) adapt model behavior to individual users to enhance user satisfaction, yet personalization can inadvertently distort factual reasoning. We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.

*Qianen Zhang,Zeyu Yang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 扩展SiMT的动作空间，新增 Sentence_Cut、Drop、Partial_Summarization、Pronominalization 四个自适应动作，在LLM框架中通过 action-aware prompting 生成训练参考；通过延迟感知的TTS评估词级单调性与时延，实现在可控的实时翻译中提升语义保真与降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统仅靠 READ/WRITE 的SiMT在严格实时约束下难以同时保证翻译质量与时延的矛盾，需通过可控的再排布、删减与简化来提升实时性与语义保真。

Method: 在大模型框架中引入四种自适应动作，并以 action-aware prompting 生成训练参考；构建一个将文本映射到具有真实时序的语音输出的延迟感知TTS流水线以评估词级单调性；在 ACL60/60 English-Chinese、English-German、English-Japanese 数据集上开展对比实验。

Result: 实验表明该框架在语义指标上持续提升，相对于参考翻译和 salami 基线具有更低的延迟；且 Drop 与 Sentence_Cut 的组合在流畅性与时延之间达到更优的权衡。

Conclusion: 扩展并丰富 SiMT 的动作空间，并在 LLM 框架中实现，显示出缩小人类与机器翻译理解差距的有力潜力。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 NAACL 框架，通过 Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules 对抗来自检索噪声的过度自信，使用约 2K 个 HotpotQA 示例进行监督微调，显著提升 ECE 指标（in-domain 10.9%，out-of-domain 8.0%），实现对噪声的内在置信度感知，无需依赖更强教师模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在检索增强生成（RAG）场景中，检索噪声（矛盾或无关证据）容易诱发模型的错误自信，导致置信度校准失效。需一个 principled、噪声感知的置信度校准框架，以提高模型的 epistemic reliability。

Method: 提出 Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules（NAACL Rules）作为理论基础，并构建 NAACL 框架。通过依据这些规则合成数据，使用约 2K 条 HotpotQA 示例进行监督微调（SFT），使模型具备对噪声的内在感知能力，避免对强教师模型的依赖。

Result: NAACL 显著提升置信度校准性能：ECE 在域内提升约 10.9%，域外提升约 8.0%，并实现从检索噪声到口头校准的桥接，提升了模型的 epistemic reliability。

Conclusion: NAACL 为在存在检索噪声的场景下实现更准确且具备 epistemic 可信度的大语言模型提供了一个可操作的框架，凸显了通过噪声感知的自我校准在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过稀疏自编码框架识别并操纵翻译的关键启动特征，揭示LLM在无任务微调下的翻译能力的机制，并据此提出数据选择与鲁棒性提升策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释和定位LLM翻译能力的内部机制，尤其是哪些特征驱动翻译过程，以及如何将这一认识转化为更高效、更鲁棒的微调与数据筛选方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器记忆并筛选在翻译输入上频繁共激活的特征；通过PCA一致性度量筛选出功能一致的特征，得到翻译启动特征集；进行因果干预（放大/消隐）以验证特征的因果性；提出面向机制难样本的数据选择策略用于微调；将该机制迁移至同族更大模型。

Result: 成功隔离出少量翻译启动特征；放大这些特征可引导正确翻译，消隐时产生幻觉/错任务输出；采用以机制难样本为重点的数据选择可显著提升数据效率并抑制幻觉；该机制可转移到同族更大模型。

Conclusion: 揭示了翻译能力的核心内部机制，提供将模型内部机制用于提升鲁棒性与效率的设计蓝图，并给出可重复的研究路径和可用代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models. The codes are available at https://github.com/flamewei123/AAAI26-translation-Initiation-Features.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机制可解释性研究中已发现检索头负责从上下文检索信息，但其是否能转化为实际性能提升仍不清楚。本研究希望通过机制驱动的信号来验证并提升长上下文能力。

Method: 提出 RetMask：通过对比正常输出与掩蔽检索头的变体输出来生成训练信号，以此驱动模型的改进。对三大模型家族进行实验，分析检索头的组织模式（集中 vs 分布）对效果的影响，并在多个长上下文相关任务上评估。

Result: 在 Llama-3.1 上，HELMET 128K 指标提升 +2.28 点；生成带引文的任务提升约 70%；段落重排提升约 32%；同时保持一般任务性能。跨三大模型家族的实验表明，集中模式的检索头更易获得显著收益，分布式模式收益有限。

Conclusion: 将对检索头的机制性理解转化为训练信号，验证了检索头的功能性并展示了利用机制洞见提升长上下文能力的可行性；结果强调了检索头组织结构对收益的关键作用。

Abstract: Advances in mechanistic interpretability have identified special attention heads, known as retrieval heads, that are responsible for retrieving information from the context. However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Anytime 推理框架与 Anytime Index，用以在有限推理预算下衡量并提升解的质量；通过推理时的自我提升，利用 LLM 合成的偏好数据学习中间解，提升效率与质量。对 NaturalPlan、AIME、GPQA 数据集在多种模型（Grok-3、GPT-oss、GPT-4.1/4o、LLaMA）上显示出稳定的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限的计算预算下，完整的逐步推理成本高昂，快速产生有用的部分解更具现实意义。许多现实任务（如旅程规划）需要在固定推理预算内交付尽可能高质量的输出，因此需要在预算内优化推理过程。

Method: 提出 Anytime 推理框架和 Anytime Index 以量化随着推理 token 增加，解的质量提升的程度；提出推理时的自我提升方法，利用 LLM 合成的偏好数据让模型通过对自身推理比较学习以改进中间解。

Result: 在 NaturalPlan（Trip）、AIME、GPQA 等数据集上的实验，Grok-3、GPT-oss、GPT-4.1/4o、LLaMA 等模型均表现出在预算限制下的推理质量和效率的显著提升。

Conclusion:  anytime 推理及自我改进策略可在预算受限的场景中显著提升解的质量与效率，具有较好的实际可用性与推广潜力。

Abstract: We study the reasoning behavior of large language models (LLMs) under limited computation budgets. In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.

TL;DR: 通过谱分析揭示预训练权重矩阵的主导奇异方向对模型通用能力的影响，并提出REVIVE在序列知识编辑中显式保护这些主导子空间，从而在提升编辑有效性的同时保持通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多轮（长时序）知识编辑对模型通用能力的崩溃机制，揭示为什么基于简单约束的编辑方法往往导致能力下降，以及为何权重矩阵的主导谱方向易被扰动。

Method: 对预训练权重矩阵进行谱分析，观察主导奇异向量/子空间随多次编辑的扰动及其与编辑有效性和通用能力下降的关系。提出REVIVE框架：将参数更新用谱基表示，并在更新中保护不想干扰的主导奇异子空间；更新的成分被过滤以避免进入受保护区域。作为一个可插拔模块应用于现有模型。

Result: 在多模型和多基准上进行广泛实验，结果显示REVIVE在长序列编辑场景中能够持续提升编辑效果，同时显著保留模型的通用能力，甚至在高达2万次编辑的极端设置下也表现稳健。

Conclusion: 通过保护预训练权重中的主导奇异子空间，REVIVE实现了对序列编辑过程的稳定化，兼顾编辑效能与通用性，提供了一种可插拔且普适的干预方式。

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoG是一种训练无关框架，通过引入双过程理论的直觉-审慎机制，对知识图谱增强的LLM进行快速稳定的推理指导与自适应反思回退，从而提升准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理中易出现幻觉，显式的知识图谱 grounding 能提供支撑，但现有KG-LLM常表现出认知刚性，对邻域噪声和结构错位敏感，导致推理停滞。需要一个训练无关的、可动态调节的推理框架。

Method: 设计两个模块：Relational Blueprint Guidance（快速直觉，使用关系蓝图作为软结构约束，快速稳定检索方向）；Failure-Aware Refinement（审慎分析，遇到推理瓶颈时触发证据条件的反思并执行受控回退）。该框架无需额外训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验表明，CoG在准确性和效率上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CoG证明了训练无关双过程机制在KG-增强LLM推理中的有效性，提升鲁棒性、降低收敛瓶颈，推动更可靠的知识推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Document-layer, schema-aware, item-level watermarking (Integrity Shield) embedded into assessment PDFs to prevent and detect usage of large language models on exams, achieving high blocking rates and reliable signature recovery across multiple LLMs and domains without altering the human-visible appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Escalating use of LLMs to solve exams from uploaded PDFs undermines academic integrity and the reliability of grades/credentials. Existing watermarking methods either operate at the token level or require control of decoding, failing against black-box models and instructor-provided documents. A robust, document-level watermark that preserves appearance and works with proprietary models is needed.

Method: Embed schema-aware, item-level watermarks directly into assessment PDFs so the human-visible layout remains unchanged. Watermarks yield stable signatures that can be recovered from model or student responses. The system is designed to resist black-box access and does not depend on watermarking decoding choices. Evaluated on 30 exams across STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, with four commercial LLMs, showing strong blocking and signature retrieval. A demo UI supports upload, preview, and inspection of AI performance/authorship evidence.

Result: Exam-level blocking: 91-94%. Signature retrieval accuracy: 89-93%. Robust across four commercial LLMs and across 30 exams spanning multiple domains, indicating high effectiveness and reliability of the watermarking scheme.

Conclusion: Integrity Shield provides a practical, effective solution for preserving assessment integrity against LLM-assisted cheating in black-box settings, enabling reliable detection of AI-authored or AI-assisted responses and offering an instructor-facing interface to manage and inspect watermark evidence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.

*Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Peter Rupnik,Vít Suchomel,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLASSLA-web 2.0 基于连续网页爬取，显著扩展南斯拉语系的网页语料库：覆盖 Bosnian、Bulgarian、Croatian、Macedonian、Montenegrin、Serbian、Slovenian 七种语言，达成 17.0 亿词、3810 万文本，并新增主题标签注释；与前代 1.0 相比，重爬两年后文本重叠仅约 20%，显示内容更新快速；同时观察到网页内容质量下降，机器生成文本占比显著上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为资源匮乏的南斯拉语族语言提供大规模、可持续的网页语料，以提升NLP资源与研究；通过持续爬取解决语料覆盖与时效性的问题。

Method: 建立跨国顶级域名的持续爬取基础设施，对南斯拉语及相关网页进行迭代性爬取；在 CLASSLA-web 1.0 基础上扩展为 CLASSLA-web 2.0，收集大规模文本（38.1M 文本，17.0B词）并自动标注主题标签；除了原有的体裁分类，新增主题标签注释。

Result: 生成 17.0B 词、38.1M 文本，覆盖七种语言：波斯尼亚语、保加利亚语、克罗地亚语、马其顿语、黑山语、塞尔维亚语、斯洛文尼亚语；与前代仅有约 20% 的文本重叠；自动主题标签注释；爬取过程中观察到网页内容质量下降，机器生成文本占比显著上升。

Conclusion: 持续爬取能带来大量新内容与覆盖面扩展，但需面对内容质量下降、机器生成文本污染的挑战，应加强质量控制、清洗策略，并对下游NLP应用带来潜在收益与影响进行持续评估。

Abstract: Crawling national top-level domains has proven to be highly effective for collecting texts in less-resourced languages. This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content. However, while the new web crawls bring growing gains, we also notice growing pains - a manual inspection of top domains reveals a visible degradation of web content, as machine-generated sites now contribute a significant portion of texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DocRE存在跨句子上下文的依赖以及长尾关系分布的问题，许多关系样本稀缺，直接训练容易导致对罕见关系的泛化不足。

Method: 提出DOREMI框架，在现有DocRE模型基础上进行迭代式训练。通过主动选择信息量最大的示例进行最小化注释，提升训练效率与对长尾关系的鲁棒性；不依赖大规模噪声数据或启发式去噪。该框架可与任意DocRE模型结合。

Result: 作者声称该方法可缓解长尾偏置、提升对稀有关系的泛化能力，并提供一个可扩展的解决方案来改进现有DocRE模型在稀有关系上的表现，且比以往依赖大规模噪声数据的方法更高效。

Conclusion: DOREMI为DocRE提供了一种可与任意现有模型兼容的主动选择注释的迭代框架，能在稀有关系上改善泛化性并提升训练效率与鲁棒性，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE) presents significant challenges due to its reliance on cross-sentence context and the long-tail distribution of relation types, where many relations have scarce training examples. In this work, we introduce DOcument-level Relation Extraction optiMizing the long taIl (DOREMI), an iterative framework that enhances underrepresented relations through minimal yet targeted manual annotations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on large-scale noisy data or heuristic denoising, DOREMI actively selects the most informative examples to improve training efficiency and robustness. DOREMI can be applied to any existing DocRE model and is effective at mitigating long-tail biases, offering a scalable solution to improve generalization on rare relations.

Motivation: 在保持下游推理性能的同时提升掩码扩散语言模型的解码并行性和训练效率，降低大模型训练成本。

Method: 结合 TraceRL 的训练日程，逐步从 AR 初始化的小块 MDM 转变为更大块的模型，进行块大小的渐进扩展以实现更高的并行解码，同时分析解码计划的收敛性，提出潜在的等效解码调度 \hat{S}。

Result: 实现了在数学推理基准上的最小性能下降，同时提高了高并行解码的能力；分析表明 T* 可能收敛到等效解码调度 \hat{S}，达到可比的性能。

Conclusion: T* 提供了一种简单且有效的渐进块尺寸扩展训练框架，兼具高并行解码与性能稳定性，且具有对解码调度的潜在等效收敛性，未来工作可进一步比较更多解码计划的收敛性和对任务多样性的适应性。

Abstract: We present T$^\star$, a simple \textsc{TraceRL}-based training curriculum for progressive block-size scaling in masked diffusion language models (MDMs). Starting from an AR-initialized small-block MDM, T$^\star$~transitions smoothly to larger blocks, enabling higher-parallelism decoding with minimal performance degradation on math reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, further analysis suggests that T$^\star$~can converge to an alternative decoding schedule $\hat{\rm S}$ that achieves comparable performance.

### [21] [Language of Thought Shapes Output Diversity in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11227)
*Shaoyang Xu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过多语言思维来提升LLM输出的多样性，发现不同思维语言在模型 thinking space中占据不同区域，跨语言采样和聚合可显著提升英语输出的多样性，并在对齐任务中带来更广的文化知识覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 输出多样性对LLMs的创造力、包容性和价值取向的表达至关重要，但往往受限于单一语言的“思维语言”。本文提出将思维语言从英语扩展到多语言，以结构性方式探索语言对思维空间的影响，并以英语输出为约束评估多样性。

Method: 提出两种重复采样策略：单语言采样（在同一思维语言下，输出受控为英语）与混合语言采样（在多种思维语言下采样再输出英语）。在大规模实验中，评估不同思维语言与英语输出之间的多样性关系，考察语言距离英语的相关性、跨语言聚合的组合效应，以及语言异质性对多样性上限的扩展。同时在跨语言设定下进行对齐任务的实用性评估。

Result: 结果显示：把思维语言从英语切换到非英语语言可持续提高输出多样性，且与思维语言距离英语呈正相关；聚合多语言采样带来额外效应，扩大多样性上限；增加语言异质性可进一步提升多样性的潜力；在 pluralistic alignment 场景中实现更广的文化知识与价值取向覆盖，且代码公开。

Conclusion: 多语言思维为提升LLM输出多样性提供了结构性来源，且在现实应用中有助于改进包容性与文化覆盖。未来可进一步探索更多语言的覆盖、跨语言思维迁移的机制，以及对齐任务中的实际效益与潜在偏见缓解。

Abstract: Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/iNLP-Lab/Multilingual-LoT-Diversity.

TL;DR: 提出FactCorrector，一种无需重新训练的跨领域后验纠错方法，改进LLMs的事实性回答，并引入VELI5基准评估纠错效果，且在VELI5及长期事实性数据集上表现出色，提供代码实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型任务中易产出事实性错误，需要无需重新训练的纠错方案；现有评估缺乏严格对事实性的纠错方法评估，需要一个包含注入错误与真实纠正的基准数据集。

Method: FactCorrector利用对原始回答事实性的结构化反馈生成纠正，属于后验纠错且跨领域适应，不进行再训练；同时提出VELI5数据集，系统地注入事实错误并给出 ground-truth 修正，用于评估纠错方法。

Result: 在VELI5及若干长文本事实性数据集上，FactCorrector显著提升事实准确性并保持相关性，优于强基线。

Conclusion: FactCorrector为LLMs的事实性纠错提供有效的后验纠错框架，并通过VELI5基准推进该领域的严格评估，代码已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in knowledge-intensive applications but often generate factually incorrect responses. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines. We release our code at https://ibm.biz/factcorrector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在使用大语言模型进行意图识别数据增强时，生成的样本可能与未目标类别存在歧义，导致标签噪声和分类性能下降，需对增强数据进行去歧义化处理。

Method: 采用 Sentence Transformers 评估 LLM 生成的类 Guided 增强样本的语义相似性；识别那些目标类别以外的语义相似样本，并通过迭代重新生成来降低歧义性。

Result: 句子嵌入在再生成或筛选不那么含混的样本方面有效，提升潜在的分类性能，特别是在意图定义宽泛或 loosely 定义的场景中的数据增广效果。

Conclusion: 提出 DDAIR 框架，通过嵌入式语义检测和迭代重生，成功缓解意图识别数据增强中的歧义问题，提升低资源场景下的分类质量与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.

TL;DR: RT-RAG 提出一种分层的推理树引导的检索增强生成框架，通过结构化分解与自下而上的证据收集提升复杂多跳问答的鲁棒性，在复杂任务上显著超越 SOTA（F1 提升约7.0%，EM 提升约6.0%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多跳问答方法多依赖 LLM 自我引导进行多步检索，容易导致查询分解不准确和各步推理之间的误差累积，从而影响推理连贯性和正确性。需要一个能够显式分解问题、降低误差传播并稳定证据收集的框架。

Method: 提出 RT-RAG 的分层框架：1) 将多跳问题分解为明确的推理树，借助结构化实体分析与共识性树选择将核心查询、已知实体和未知实体分离；2) 采用自下而上的遍历策略，进行迭代式查询重写与证据 refined，以减小错误传播并提升证据质量。

Result: 在复杂多跳问答任务上，RT-RAG 相比现有方法显著提升性能，F1 提升约7.0%，EM 提升约6.0%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的推理树分解和自下而上的证据收集，RT-RAG 能有效降低推理过程中的误差累积，提升复杂多跳问答的准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将一个较小的解码器式大语言模型用于多任务学习（MTL），实现对声明检测、证据排序和立场检测的单模型多任务处理；在零-shot/少量示例设置下取得显著相对提升，但并非在所有任务上都优于单任务基线；并给出实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对大模型的高成本、封闭权重及多模型维护带来的可持续性问题，提出用一个开源/小型权重模型进行多任务微调以覆盖自动化事实核查的关键子任务。

Method: 使用小型解码器式LLM（如 Qwen3-4b），探究三种MTL策略：分类头、因果语言建模头和指令微调。对模型大小、任务顺序及与非LLM基线的比较进行系统评估。任务涉及声明检测、证据重新排序与立场检测。

Result: MTL模型在某些任务上表现出显著相对增益：声明检测最多达44%、证据重新排序最多达54%、立场检测最多达31%，相对于零-shot/少量样本设置的基线。然而，MTL并非在所有情况下都超过单任务基线，效果存在任务与设置的异质性。

Conclusion: 在小型解码器式LLM上通过MTL进行AFC具有实用性和显著潜力，能够减少模型数量与成本并给出可操作的实践指南；但需注意不同任务与模型配置之间的性能波动与潜在的负迁移风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated fact-checking (AFC) by enabling unified, end-to-end verification pipelines rather than isolated components. While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability. Fine-tuning smaller open weight models for individual AFC tasks can help but requires multiple specialized models resulting in high costs. We propose \textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \textbf{44\%}, \textbf{54\%}, and \textbf{31\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings. Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.

Method: 通过设计面向文本输出的高级采样策略与评分机制，在仅能访问生成文本的前提下进行成员推断，并辅以针对训练数据可暴露特征的分析。

Result: 在黑盒设定下达到或接近利用内部信息的基线的性能水平；同时提出 WikiMIA-25 基准以评估在现代专有 LLM 上的 MIA 性能与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为文本仅访问的 MIA 提供稳健解法，并通过 WikiMIA-25 促进对现代私有 LLM 的隐私评估研究与比较。

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种开源、可指令遵循的全双工对话语音模型，通过冻结音频编码器、仅微调语言模型实现高效训练，约2,000小时数据，支持对说话人、话题、对话行为等的指令控制，单阶段训练，旨在促进可重复研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的口语对话系统在自然性和可定制性方面不足，难以实现动态上下文适应；需要在学术资源约束下实现高效、可控的端到端对话语音系统，并推动可重复研究。

Method: 将音频编码器保持冻结，仅对语言模型进行微调；采用单阶段训练协议；使用约2,000小时数据；实现对说话人声音、对话话题、对话行为（如回话、打断）和对话开启的指令控制；开放模型及训练代码以促进复现实验。

Result: 声称在常规学术资源约束下实现高效训练；模型具备指令控制能力，覆盖说话人、话题、对话行为和开启；将发布代码以便可重复研究。

Conclusion: 提出一种高效的训练范式、开源实现和可控能力，为可重复研究提供基础，但具体的评估、可泛化性和对不同声学条件的适应性尚待实验验证。

Abstract: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出以自然语言编辑式评估与解决方案生成，强调将竞赛编程中的求解与实现分离；通过黄金编辑提升解题率，但实现阶段仍是瓶颈；构建83题数据集与LLM评估框架，提出LLM评审可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLMs在竞赛编程中的评估混淆了推理与实现，需将求解过程以自然语言编辑式的文本表示，以便更准确地评估推理能力、定位瓶颈并进行可扩展评估。

Method: 提出先生成编辑待写（editorial）再编码的工作流，比较模型生成编辑与黄金编辑之间的差异，借助专家注释诊断推理错误；验证LLM作为评审者的可扩展评估协议；构建包含黄金编辑与完整测试用例的83道ICPC风格题目数据集，对19种LLMs进行评估。

Result: 编辑先行的策略在部分模型上提升解题率，黄金编辑带来显著收益；但即使有黄金编辑，模型在实现阶段仍显不足；生成编辑与黄金编辑之间的差距暴露了持续的求解性算法设定瓶颈；LLM作为评审的评估框架被初步验证，具备可扩展性。

Conclusion: 未来基准应明确区分问题求解与实现的评价维度，单纯的通过通过/未通过评估不足以揭示真正的推理能力，应结合编辑质量与实现正确性进行综合评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.

TL;DR: 将推理视为对最优思考策略的动态搜索，发现稀疏但高质量的推理路径，在准确性与输出长度之间实现帕累托提升；在多项基准上准确性提升并显著缩短生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought推理往往以顺序方式产生中间步骤，缺乏前瞻性，易陷入次优路径且包含冗余步骤，需在准确性与计算成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 将推理过程形式化为对推理算子（operators）的候选集合进行动态搜索，使用双因素启发式（正确性与计算成本）评估并筛选路径；发现并优先导航到稀疏的高质量推理路径，以实现更短且更准确的输出。

Result: 在多项推理基准上实现帕累托改进，准确性提升超过3.5%，输出长度减少超过22%；给出代码与数据。

Conclusion: 证实推理空间中存在稀疏的高效策略，通过主动搜索能够在准确性与成本之间取得更优的平衡，NCoTS具有良好的可推广性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps sequentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can draft patient portal messages but aligning drafts with individual clinicians is challenging; a thematic taxonomy and evaluation framework were developed; an expert-annotated dataset was released; theme-driven adaptation improves performance; significant epistemic uncertainty remains, necessitating clinician-specific customization for safe use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLM-generated drafts can meaningfully reduce clinician workload in patient-portal communications and to understand alignment between LLMs and individual clinicians, addressing safety and efficiency concerns in clinical workflows.

Method: Develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses; propose an evaluation framework to measure clinician editing load at content and theme levels; release an expert-annotated dataset; conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization.

Result: Findings show substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. LLMs can draft certain themes but struggle with clinician-aligned generation for others, notably in eliciting information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation improves performance across most themes.

Conclusion: To enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communications, LLMs must be adapted to individual clinician preferences and workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的评估工具多针对通用基准，难以充分利用科学领域的知识且需任务特定微调，成本高且对低资源场景不友好。需要一个可跨任务、开源、低成本的评估模型来对开放式科学写作任务进行可靠评价。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：阶段1优化科学评估偏好，阶段2进一步提升推理能力；设计多维评估（多方面）并在不同任务间联合训练，确保对动态评判标准的鲁棒性，并实现跨任务的泛化。

Result: 实验表明该训练策略显著提升了基于LLM的科学写作评估能力，模型能在未见任务或未见评估设置下泛化，且可重复使用为一个通用评估器，无需对每个任务重新微调。

Conclusion: 该方法提供一个成本可控、开源、可跨任务复用的科学写作评估解决方案，提升了评估质量与鲁棒性，减轻了低资源场景的微调负担。

Abstract: Scientific writing is an expert-domain task that demands deep domain knowledge, task-specific requirements and reasoning capabilities that leverage the domain knowledge to satisfy the task specifications. While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.

TL;DR: 探究大型语言模型在对合成实体建立事实知识时的幻觉现象。提出 SyntHal 数据集，六种关系，6000 个实体，测量关系线性度与幻觉率之间的相关性，发现强相关性，提示知识表示中的关系线性度影响自我知识评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何中等规模的 LLM 更易产生幻觉，以及在面对未知合成实体时的知识自我评估困难。提出假设：关系的线性性影响知识的抽象存储，从而影响模型对自己是否知道某事实的判定。

Method: 构建 SyntHal 数据集：六种关系、6000 个合成实体；在四个模型上评估，对每个关系测量幻觉率并通过 Δcos 评估线性度；计算幻觉率与线性度的相关性 r 以检验假设。

Result: 在六个关系中，幻觉率与线性度之间呈现强相关，相关系数在 [0.78, 0.82] 区间；支持“关系存储的线性性影响自我知识评估能力”的假设；对如何管理幻觉及提升对事实知识表示的研究方向提供新线索。

Conclusion: 关系的线性性决定了知识的抽象存储程度，影响模型对自身知识的评估与幻觉表现。该结果指向通过改进事实知识的表示方式来减轻幻觉的潜在途径，并提出未来在知识表示方面的研究方向。

Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.

### [33] [The unreasonable effectiveness of pattern matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11432)
*Gary Lupyan,Blaise Agüera y Arcas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can recover semantics from Jabberwocky-style input, demonstrating that pattern-matching underpins much of their success and challenging views of LLMs as mere language mimics, databases, or Web surrogates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address debates about what LLMs actually do: whether they understand meaning or rely on surface statistics and pattern regularities; test whether semantic interpretation can arise from structural cues even when content words are meaningless.

Method: Introduce Jabberwocky-like sentences by replacing content words with nonsense strings; evaluate whether LLMs can infer plausible meanings or translations from grammatical and pattern cues; compare with expectations under alternative explanations (pure memorization, retrieval, or keyword matching).

Result: LLMs show the ability to infer meaning and produce plausible interpretations despite content-word scrambling, leveraging structural patterns and syntax; this supports the view that pattern-matching contributes to understanding.

Conclusion: Pattern-matching is a central mechanism in LLM performance and is not merely a proxy for true intelligence; recognizing its role helps unify competing theories of what LLMs do and where their limitations lie.

Abstract: We report on an astonishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to make sense of "Jabberwocky" language in which most or all content words have been randomly replaced by nonsense strings, e.g., translating "He dwushed a ghanc zawk" to "He dragged a spare chair". This result addresses ongoing controversies regarding how to best think of what LLMs are doing: are they a language mimic, a database, a blurry version of the Web? The ability of LLMs to recover meaning from structural patterns speaks to the unreasonable effectiveness of pattern-matching. Pattern-matching is not an alternative to "real" intelligence, but rather a key ingredient.

TL;DR: HORSE introduces a hierarchical orthogonal residual spread (HORSE) of the information matrix for model editing in LLMs, aiming to reduce gradient noise and improve stability and scalability. It provides theoretical comparisons with existing methods and empirical validation on two datasets across multiple LLMs, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model editing methods optimize an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. This can be computationally expensive and may introduce conflicts between updates. There is a need for a more stable, scalable editing paradigm.

Method: Proposes HORSE, leveraging hierarchical orthogonal residual spread of the information matrix to decorrelate and stabilize updates, reducing noisy gradients and enabling robust, large-scale edits. Includes theoretical comparisons with popular methods and extensive empirical evaluation.

Result: HORSE achieves precise and robust editing across diverse scenarios, maintaining effectiveness on multiple LLMs over two datasets, with strong empirical performance and stability.

Conclusion: HALD (HORSE) offers a stable, scalable alternative to existing model editing approaches by reducing gradient noise via hierarchical orthogonal residual spread, supported by theory and extensive experiments; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTARAG introduces test-time adaptation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by teaching the model to predict retrieved content, enabling online parameter updates during inference to better adapt to specialized domains; evaluated on six domains with substantial gains; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG enhances QA by using external knowledge but faces distribution shifts when applied to specialized domains, hurting generalization. Test-time adaptation aims to align the model with domain-specific retrieval distributions.

Method: During inference, TTARAG updates the language model parameters online, guided by the objective of predicting the retrieved content, effectively coupling generation with retrieval to adapt to a target domain.

Result: Experiments across six specialized domains show substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

Conclusion: TTARAG demonstrates the viability of test-time adaptation for RAG in specialized domains, improving domain-specific QA performance; code availability facilitates reproducibility.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing large language models' question-answering capabilities through the integration of external knowledge. However, when adapting RAG systems to specialized domains, challenges arise from distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose TTARAG, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference to improve RAG system performance in specialized domains. Our method introduces a simple yet effective approach where the model learns to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic parameter adjustment to the target domain. Through extensive experiments across six specialized domains, we demonstrate that TTARAG achieves substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有 Radiology Report Generation 的领域指标在临床场景中的鲁棒性、可迁移性与可比性不足的问题，缺乏统一、可验证的评估框架。

Method: 三模块评估：WSG（通过 LLM 重述实现写作风格泛化）、SEI（分级严重度的合成错误注入）、MvE（利用 175 例 disagreement 医师打分评估指标与专家的一致性）；对八个指标（BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR、BERTScore-F1、F1-RadGraph、RaTEScore、GREEN Score、CRG）在七个基于 CT-CLIP 的 LLM 上进行比较，使用 Spearman 相关等统计量。

Result: 指出 lexical NLG 指标对风格变化敏感；GREEN Score 与专家判断相关性最高（约 Spearman 0.70），CRG 相关性为负；BERTScore-F1 对事实错误注入不敏感；将公开框架、代码及部分匿名评估数据以促进再现性与未来指标开发。

Conclusion: 提出首个统一框架用于评估 CT RRG 指标的临床可用性与鲁棒性，结果指向 GREEN Score 的相对可靠性，并强调需要对现有指标进行改进和对比，未来工作可扩展到更多任务与数据集。

Abstract: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.

TL;DR: LRM 生成的链式推理（CoT）解释在跨模型上显示出一定的泛化性，能提高不同 LRMs 之间的行为一致性；其泛化与人类偏好及 RLHF 有关；文中给出逐句级别的集成策略以提升一致性；对利用解释获得新洞见需谨慎并提出解释泛化的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清 CoT 解释是否能跨模型泛化，是否反映对问题的普遍模式，而非特定模型的表征，从而为 AI 科学中的概念发现提供可靠解释。

Method: 通过让一个 LRM 生成 CoT 解释并将其输入给其他 LRMs，评估解释对输出的一致性；量化跨模型一致性，与人类偏好排序和 RLHF 的相关性；分析哪些条件下解释能产生一致答案；提出逐句级别的集成策略以提升一致性。

Result: CoT 解释往往能提升跨模型的一致性，与人类偏好和 RLHF 的排名相关；提出的逐句集成方法能提高一致性；给出解释泛化的条件分析。

Conclusion: 在利用 LRM 解释来获得新洞见时需保持谨慎，提出一个用于刻画 LRM 解释泛化的框架，并给出简单但有效的集成策略以提高稳定性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 令牌（token）常被视为跨模型、跨文本域的统一计量单位，但不同分词器对同一文本的令牌化结果差异显著，可能扭曲模型比较和成本估算。

Method: 对不同文本分布与模型的分词进行系统实证分析，评估文本序列在不同分布下被压缩为令牌的程度，比较跨模型、跨领域的分词差异，检验常用令牌长度启发式的有效性。

Result: 发现令牌长度的常用启发式过于简单，令牌化差异随文本分布和模型而显著，单纯以令牌数对比或定价可能误导。

Conclusion: 为理解和解读现代大语言模型的令牌化提供更清晰的直觉与框架，推动在跨模型比较和成本估算时采用更稳健的分词理解。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.

### [39] [Tail-Aware Data Augmentation for Long-Tail Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10933)
*Yizhou Dang,Zhifu Wei,Minhan Huang,Lianbo Ma,Jianzhe Zhao,Guibing Guo,Xingwei Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) 来解决长尾序列推荐问题，通过对低人气项的共现关系建模，设计 T-Substitute 与 T-Insert 两种增强算子，并在表示层混合原序列与增强序列，扩展跨用户的增强样本以提升尾部性能，同时尽量不损害头部表现。结果在实验中显示优越性，代码公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾问题在推荐系统中普遍存在：多数用户与项的交互稀疏，导致尾部偏好难以学习。现有方法要么借助头部信息补充尾部，要么利用额外上下文，但往往无法显著提高尾部效果且可能损害头部/整体体验。

Method: 基于线性模型捕捉低人气项之间的共现与相关性，设计两种尾部感知的增强操作：T-Substitute 将头部项替换为相关的尾部项；T-Insert 依据共现关系通过增加头部和尾部项来扩展原序列。将增强序列与原序列在表示层进行混合，以保留偏好信息；进一步将混合操作扩展到不同尾部用户序列及增强序列之间，以生成更丰富的增强样本。

Result: 通过大规模实验验证，TADA 在提升尾部用户/项的学习能力方面具有显著优势，同时保持头部性能，且给出公开代码。

Conclusion: 提出一种面向尾部的序列增强框架，通过对低人气项的共现关系建模并进行多样化混合扩增，有效改善尾部的学习效果，兼顾整体/头部体验。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) learns user preferences based on their historical interaction sequences and provides personalized suggestions. In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. The codes are provided at https://github.com/KingGugu/TADA.

### [40] [Can Instructed Retrieval Models Really Support Exploration?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10936)
*Piyush Maheshwari,Sheshera Mysore,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Instructed retrievers improve ranking relevance over instruction-agnostic baselines, but instruction-following behavior does not track ranking gains and can be insensitive or counter-intuitive to instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploratory searches have under-specified goals and evolving intents. The study evaluates whether instruction-following retrievers can better capture nuanced query intents for aspect-conditional seed-guided exploration.

Method: Evaluate instructed retrievers (LLMs fine-tuned for instruction-following) and general-purpose LLMs prompted for ranking using Pairwise Ranking Prompting on an expert-annotated test collection; compare with instruction-agnostic models; assess both ranking relevance and instruction-following behavior.

Result: Best instructed retrievers show improved ranking relevance over instruction-agnostic models. However, instruction-following performance does not correlate with these ranking gains and can be insensitive or counter-intuitive to instructions.

Conclusion: Users may benefit from current instructed retrievers for some tasks, but for long-running exploratory sessions requiring strong instruction sensitivity, these models may not deliver expected user experiences.

Abstract: Exploratory searches are characterized by under-specified goals and evolving query intents. In such scenarios, retrieval models that can capture user-specified nuances in query intent and adapt results accordingly are desirable -- instruction-following retrieval models promise such a capability. In this work, we evaluate instructed retrievers for the prevalent yet under-explored application of aspect-conditional seed-guided exploration using an expert-annotated test collection. We evaluate both recent LLMs fine-tuned for instructed retrieval and general-purpose LLMs prompted for ranking with the highly performant Pairwise Ranking Prompting. We find that the best instructed retrievers improve on ranking relevance compared to instruction-agnostic approaches. However, we also find that instruction following performance, crucial to the user experience of interacting with models, does not mirror ranking relevance improvements and displays insensitivity or counter-intuitive behavior to instructions. Our results indicate that while users may benefit from using current instructed retrievers over instruction-agnostic models, they may not benefit from using them for long-running exploratory sessions requiring greater sensitivity to instructions.

*Shuguang Jiao,Xinyu Xiao,Yunfan Wei,Shuhan Qi,Chengkai Huang,Quan Z. Michael Sheng,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 PruneRAG，通过可控的查询分解树、置信度引导的分支剪枝和细粒度检索，缓解证据遗忘与检索冗余问题，提升多跳问答的准确性和效率；并引入 Evidence Forgetting Rate 作为证据滥用的度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的检索-生成框架在推理深度增加或检索树扩张时，容易出现证据遗忘与检索低效的问题，未能将检索到的证据稳健地整合到推理过程中，需通过结构化查询、置信度控制和更精细的检索来提升证据利用率与检索效率。

Method: 提出 PruneRAG：建立结构化的查询分解树以支撑多跳推理；三大机制包括自适应节点扩展以控制树的宽度与深度，置信度引导的决策以接受可靠答案并剪枝不确定分支，以及细粒度检索提取实体级锚点以提升检索精准度。同时定义 Evidence Forgetting Rate 指标以量化黄金证据被检索但未正确使用的情况；在多跳问答基准上进行广泛实验对比。

Result: 与最先进基线相比，PruneRAG在准确性与效率上实现显著提升，显著降低检索开销，且在多跳推理中更好地保持证据信息的相关性与可用性。

Conclusion: 通过对检索和证据利用的耦合控制，PruneRAG为稳定、高效的多跳推理提供了鲁棒框架；引入的 Evidence Forgetting Rate 量化证据误用，为评估与改进检索-推理系统提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a powerful framework for enhancing large language models in knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks. However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used. Extensive experiments across various multi-hop QA benchmarks show that PruneRAG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Xiaoyu Liang,Yuchen Peng,Jiale Luo,Wenhao Wang,Haoji Hu,Xincheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 Learn Before Represent (LBR) 框架，在两个阶段实现领域知识注入与对比学习以提高竖直领域的表征质量，显著优于强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 LLM+CL 侧重语义对齐但缺乏知识获取，导致专业术语和领域知识难以掌握；需要在不改变架构的前提下解决知识获取与对齐的目标冲突。

Method: 两阶段：1) 信息瓶颈约束的生成学习进行领域知识注入，同时保持 LLM 的因果注意力以最大化知识获取并压缩语义；2) 在压缩后的表征上进行 Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning 以实现对齐；保持架构一致性，解决生成与对比学习的目标冲突。

Result: 在医疗、化学、代码检索等竖直任务上，LBR 显著优于强基线。

Conclusion: 为竖直领域构建准确、鲁棒表征开辟新范式，强调知识获取与对齐的两阶段结合。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) adapted via contrastive learning excel in general representation learning but struggle in vertical domains like chemistry and law, primarily due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.

*Yuejie Li,Ke Yang,Tao Wang,Bolin Chen,Bowen Li,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 Deep GraphRAG，一个分层检索+自适应整合的框架，通过全局到局部的检索策略和 beam-search 动态再排序，在 1.5B 模型上通过 DW-GRPO 训练的紧凑模型接近 70B 大模型的性能，在 Natural Questions 和 HotpotQA 上优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 GraphRAG 在大规模层级图上存在的全局覆盖性与局部检索效率之间的权衡；当前方法缺乏鲁棒的多阶段再排序，难以在导航大规模层级图时实现高效且高质量的信息整合。

Method: 提出分层全局到局部检索策略，分三阶段： (1) inter-community filtering，使用局部上下文裁剪搜索空间；(2) community-level refinement，基于实体交互分析排序相关子图；(3) entity-level 的微观检索，在目标社区内进行。引入基于 beam search 的动态再排序模块，持续筛选候选以平衡效率与全局覆盖。知识整合模块采用紧凑的 LLM（1.5B），并通过 Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO) 进行训练，动态调整奖励权重以兼顾相关性、可信度和简洁性。

Result: 在 Natural Questions 和 HotpotQA 上显著优于基线图检索方法，在准确性和效率上均有提升。

Conclusion: Deep GraphRAG 实现了在全局与局部之间的平衡检索与自适应知识整合，使紧凑模型在知识整合任务上接近大模型性能；基于 beam 搜索的动态再排序提升了效率-全局覆盖的权衡；对大规模层次图检索具有实用性和推广潜力。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) frameworks face a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of global search and the efficiency of local search. Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [44] [Cross-Modal Attention Network with Dual Graph Learning in Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11151)
*Ji Dai,Quan Fang,Jun Hu,Desheng Cai,Yang Yang,Can Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CRANE uses a Cross-modal Recursive Attention with dual graphs to enable symmetric, high-order fusion of multimodal data in recommender systems, achieving ~5% gains on four datasets with scalable efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two critical limitations in multimedia recommender systems: (i) shallow, concatenation-based fusion that fails to exploit high-order intra- and inter-modal relationships, and (ii) asymmetric feature treatment where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items have rich multimodal content, hindering a shared semantic space.

Method: Introduce Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) to iteratively refine modality features in a joint latent space, construct symmetric multimodal user profiles by aggregating interacted-item features, and employ a dual-graph framework (heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and homogeneous item-item semantic graph) fused via a self-supervised contrastive objective.

Result: Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate scalability and efficiency, with faster convergence on small datasets and higher performance ceilings on large-scale data. Empirical evaluation on four public datasets shows an average ~5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: CRANE effectively achieves deep cross-modal fusion and symmetric multimodal learning through recursive attention and dual-graph contrastive learning, delivering consistent performance gains and scalable efficiency across datasets.

Abstract: Multimedia recommendation systems leverage user-item interactions and multimodal information to capture user preferences, enabling more accurate and personalized recommendations. Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones. Comprehensive experiments on four public real-world datasets validate an average 5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 将稀疏自动编码器（SAE）嵌入协同过滤中的 CFAE，获得单义性潜在表示，并提出语义概念到单一神经元的映射及其用于定向推荐的简单方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协同过滤模型难以解释潜在特征及其对生成过程的影响，通过 SAEs 提供可解释、可控的表示，可实现对推荐的定向 steering。

Method: 在 CFAE 的编码器与解码器之间插入 SAE，训练以获得单义性较强的中间表示；提出将语义概念映射到单个神经元的映射函数；评估利用该中间表示实现定向推荐的简单策略。

Result: 该中间表示在一定程度上表现为单义性，能够建立语义概念到神经元的映射，并展示了通过该表示对推荐方向进行引导的可行性。

Conclusion: 将 SAE 与 CFAE 结合可获得更具解释性的中间表示和可控性，适用于协同过滤；未来工作可拓展更多语义概念、分析鲁棒性并提升引导策略的效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as pivotal tools for introspection into large language models. SAEs can uncover high-quality, interpretable features at different levels of granularity and enable targeted steering of the generation process by selectively activating specific neurons in their latent activations. Our paper is the first to apply this approach to collaborative filtering, aiming to extract similarly interpretable features from representations learned purely from interaction signals. In particular, we focus on a widely adopted class of collaborative autoencoders (CFAEs) and augment them by inserting an SAE between their encoder and decoder networks. We demonstrate that such representation is largely monosemantic and propose suitable mapping functions between semantic concepts and individual neurons. We also evaluate a simple yet effective method that utilizes this representation to steer the recommendations in a desired direction.

### [46] [LLM-Assisted Pseudo-Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11238)
*David Otero,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一个混合查询扩展方法：在 RM3 之前加入基于大语言模型的过滤阶段。LLM对初始前k排序的文档进行判定，仅对被认为相关的文档进行 RM3 估计，从而在保留经典 PRF 的可解释性和鲁棒性的同时利用 LLM 的语义判断，改善检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的伪相关反馈（PRF）易受主题漂移影响；基于LLM的扩展/变体虽然有效，但可能产生幻觉且与文献集特定术语不对齐。需要一种兼具鲁棒性、可解释性与语义判别能力的混合方法，解决词汇不匹配与噪声文档的问题。

Method: 在 RM3 估计前插入基于 LLM 的文档筛选阶段：对初始前 k 名文档进行 LLM 判定，将被判定为相关的文档用于 RM3 的扩展向量计算。

Result: 在多个数据集和评价指标上，该方法较盲 PRF 与强基线均有改进。

Conclusion: 简单的干预即可提升检索鲁棒性与性能，同时保留经典 PRF 的可解释性，结合了 LLM 的语义判断与传统检索的透明性。

Abstract: Query expansion is a long-standing technique to mitigate vocabulary mismatch in ad hoc Information Retrieval. Pseudo-relevance feedback methods, such as RM3, estimate an expanded query model from the top-ranked documents, but remain vulnerable to topic drift when early results include noisy or tangential content. Recent approaches instead prompt Large Language Models to generate synthetic expansions or query variants. While effective, these methods risk hallucinations and misalignment with collection-specific terminology. We propose a hybrid alternative that preserves the robustness and interpretability of classical PRF while leveraging LLM semantic judgement. Our method inserts an LLM-based filtering stage prior to RM3 estimation: the LLM judges the documents in the initial top-$k$ ranking, and RM3 is computed only over those accepted as relevant. This simple intervention improves over blind PRF and a strong baseline across several datasets and metrics.

Method: 在受控实验中分组暴露于 SERPs 与 AI 生成播客信息，操作变量包括曝光序列与信息模态，样本量 N=483；测量态度变化及相关偏向、议题争议性等因素，分析是否存在个体调节变量。

Result: 大多数参与者出现态度变化；曝光序列对态度变化有显著影响；观点偏见和议题争议性在态度变化中起作用；但个体调节变量未检测到显著效应。

Conclusion: 媒介模态与曝光顺序的交互对态度形成有显著影响，提示在信息呈现设计中需考虑序列与偏见因素；未来研究应进一步探讨偏见、争议性及实际应用中的干预策略。

Abstract: Compared to search engine result pages (SERPs), AI-generated podcasts represent a relatively new and relatively more passive modality of information consumption, delivering narratives in a naturally engaging format. As these two media increasingly converge in everyday information-seeking behavior, it is essential to explore how their interaction influences user attitudes, particularly in contexts involving controversial, value-laden, and often debated topics. Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions. A majority of users in our study corresponded to attitude change outcomes, and we found an effect of sequence on attitude change. Our results further revealed a role of viewpoint bias and the degree of topic controversiality in shaping attitude change, although we found no effect of individual moderators.

Abstract: Assessing the validity of user simulators when used for the evaluation of information retrieval systems remains an open question, constraining their effective use and the reliability of simulation-based results. To address this issue, we conduct a comprehensive literature review with a particular focus on methods for the validation of simulated user queries with regard to real queries. Based on the review, we develop a taxonomy that structures the current landscape of available measures. We empirically corroborate the taxonomy by analyzing the relationships between the different measures applied to four different datasets representing diverse search scenarios. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations on which measures or combinations of measures should be considered when validating user simulation in different contexts. Furthermore, we release a dedicated library with the most commonly used measures to facilitate future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a semantic course recommendation system for students using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach built upon BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Traditional BERT embeddings suffer from anisotropic representation spaces, where course descriptions exhibit high cosine similarities regardless of semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.

### [50] [Analytic Bijections for Smooth and Interpretable Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10774)
*Mathis Gerdes,Miranda C. N. Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出并验证三类解析的全局光滑双射（cubic rational、sinh、cubic polynomial）及径向流，作为耦合流的高效替代，提升表达力与训练稳定性，在1D/2D基准与φ^4格点理论等物理场景展现优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标定型流方法在可逆性与表达力之间存在权衡：仿射变换简单且解析但表达力不足；单调样条在局部可控但受限于分段光滑且作用在有界域；残差流虽光滑但需要数值求逆。因此，需要具备全局光滑、在全实数域定义且解析可逆性的变换，以同时结合前者的稳定性和后者的表达力。

Method: 提出三族解析双射（cubic rational、sinh、cubic polynomial），在全实数域上定义且具有C∞光滑性，且可用闭式解析求逆，将其作为耦合流的直接替代；并设计径向流，通过直接参数化径向坐标并保持角向分量的方向，从而实现稳定训练、几何可解释性，并在径向结构目标上达到与耦合流相当的效果，但参数量显著减少。

Result: 所提双射在1D/2D基准中与或超过样条基线；径向流在具有径向结构的目标上，训练稳定性突出、几何直观性强，且在参数量减少1000倍的情况下达到与耦合流相近的质量；在φ^4格点理论等高维物理任务上，显著优于仿射基线，并便于面向问题的设计以缓解模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 提供了一组高效且可扩展的解析双射与径向流，提升Normalizing Flows的可表达性、稳定性与可解释性，适合作为耦合流的通用替代，并在物理应用中展现出强大的适用性与调度潜力。

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺场景下，简单的等权多源迁移易产生负迁移；现有方法往往只优化源权重或转移量中的一个。需要同时考虑两者的联合优化及其理论基础。

Method: 建立基于 Kullback–Leibler 距离的泛化误差的渐近分析，将多源迁移学习建模为参数估计问题，联合确定各源的权重和转移数量。给出单源权重的闭式解、以及多源情形的凸优化求解；并提出适用于多源迁移学习和多任务学习的实际算法。

Result: 理论结果包括：在权重调整后，使用所有可用源样本是最优的；对多源可通过凸优化获得最优转移权重；在 DomainNet、Office-Home 等真实数据集上，UOWQ 显著优于强基线，验证理论与方法的有效性。

Conclusion: UOWQ 提供一个理论上扎实且在实际数据上有效的多源迁移学习框架，能同时优化源权重与转移量，减少负迁移并提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

*Chutian Ma,Grigorii Pomazkin,Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出预测AC分数，将多步概率预测的准确性与一致性绑定为可微分目标，用于训练季节性ARIMA；在M4 Hourly数据集上实现对MLE的显著改进，达到75%波动降低且点预测精度相当或更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测多关注准确性，忽视随预测起点变化的稳定性与一致性，需引入同时衡量准确性与时序稳定性的评估/优化目标。

Method: 定义forecast AC分数及可控权重，将其作为可微分目标函数；在季节性ARIMA上实现并用于训练；在M4 Hourly上评估。

Result: 与MLE相比，AC优化模型在相同目标时间戳下实现约75%的波动下降，点预测精度保持相当甚至提升。

Conclusion: AC分数有效平衡准确性与一致性，能提升多步概率预测的稳定性；可作为其他模型的可微分优化目标，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

### [54] [Action Shapley: A Training Data Selection Metric for World Model in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10905)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Action Shapley作为世界模型训练数据选择的无偏指标，通过随机化动态算法近似计算以降低Shapley的指数复杂度，在五个数据受限的真实案例中实现>80%的计算效率提升，并且基于Action Shapley的训练数据选择策略优于随意选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线/模型基础的强化学习中，世界模型的质量明显依赖训练数据的质量。缺乏无偏、可扩展的数据选择度量和高效计算方法，限制了模型的可靠性与可解释性。

Method: 提出Action Shapley作为训练数据的贡献度度量，并设计一种随机化动态算法以近似计算Shapley值，降低原本的指数时间复杂度。通过在五个数据受限的真实世界案例中进行实验评估，验证算法的计算效率和数据选择效果。

Result: 算法在计算效率上相对于传统指数时间计算提升超过80%，基于Action Shapley的训练数据选择策略在多案例中持续优于随机或任意数据选择（ad-hoc）。

Conclusion: Action Shapley提供一种鲁棒且可扩展的训练数据选择框架，有助于提升世界模型在数据受限场景中的学习效果与解释性。

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 FAConvLSTM，作为 ConvLSTM2D 的高效替代，通过因子化门控与轻量级注意力提升空间表达力与可解释性，并显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决 ConvLSTM2D 的高计算成本、局部感受野限制以及对长期地理耦合与多尺度相互作用建模不足的问题。

Method: 引入 Factorized-Attention 机制：1x1 bottlenecks、深度wise 空间混合、多尺度扩张分支、SE 重校准、peephole、稀疏时间上的轴向空间注意力；还设计子空间头以时间自注意力和固定季节位置编码生成紧凑嵌入。作为 ConvLSTM2D 的无缝替换。

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM 成为高分辨率时空地球观测数据建模的高效、表达丰富且可解释的替代方案，能够有效捕捉远程耦合并实现端到端的高效推理。

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

### [56] [HOSL: Hybrid-Order Split Learning for Memory-Constrained Edge Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10940)
*Aakriti,Zhe Li,Dandan Liang,Chao Huang,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 HOSL，混合零阶（客户端）与一阶（服务器端）分割学习框架，显著降低边缘设备显存并维持高精度训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割学习多依赖客户端的一阶优化，需要在本地存储激活等中间量，导致显存开销大，抵消分割学习的优势。零阶优化虽可省去反向传播和激活存储，但收敛慢、性能下降。需在内存效率与优化效果之间取得折中。

Method: 在客户端使用内存高效的零阶梯度估计以消除反向传播和激活存储；在服务器端使用一阶优化以实现快速收敛；给出理论收敛率为 O(√(dc / (TQ)))，其中 dc 为客户端模型维度、TQ 与服务器端计算相关；在 OPT 模型（125M 与 1.3B）上进行六任务实验，比较 FO 基线、ZO 基线与 HOSL。

Result: 客户端显存相比 FO 方法可降低至多 3.7×，精度在基线的 0.20%-4.23% 区间内，且优于仅使用 ZO 的基线（提高最多 15.55%）。

Conclusion: 通过将客户端的内存高效 ZO 与服务端的 FO 结合，HOSL 实现了轻量化的分割学习训练，同时保持接近或优于单独 FO/ZO 的性能，理论与实证均证明其在资源受限设备上的应用潜力。

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

*Ning Yang,Yikuan Zhang,Qi Ouyang,Chao Tang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了SGD偏好平坦、泛化性强解的物理机制：训练初期存在一个探索阶段，SGD噪声将损失地形局部重塑为有利于平坦解的等效势，随后能量障碍增大导致跨谷跃冻结并锁定在单谷。增大噪声强度可延迟冻结，从而提高收敛到平坦最小值的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何SGD倾向于平坦最小值及其对泛化的影响，建立学习动力学、损失地形与泛化之间的统一物理框架。

Method: 通过数值实验分析SGD的学习动力学，构建可处理的物理模型，研究噪声如何把损失地形转化为有效势，以及跨谷跃的冻结机制，验证对平坦解的偏好。

Result: 发现一个瞬态的探索阶段，SGD轨迹不断逃离尖锐谷区并向更平坦区域转移；噪声重塑损失地形为有利于平坦解的势，训练后期能量障碍提升抑制谷间跃迁，导致仅在一个 Basin 内停留；增大噪声可推迟冻结，提升收敛到平坦最小值的概率。

Conclusion: 提出一个统一的物理框架，将学习动力学、地形几何和泛化联系起来，并为设计更高效的优化算法提供原则。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出元引导的无梯度强化学习框架 MGF-RL，通过历史故障经验学习可迁移初始化并快速自适应 unseen 场景，结合一阶元学习与进化策略以实现梯度不可导的策略搜索，在 IEEE 13/123-bus 系统上优于标准 RL、MAML-RL 与 MPC，且具有子线性遗憾界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端事件后恢复关键负载需要自适应控制以维持配电网韧性；但可再生能源的不确定性、有限的可调资源和非线性动力学使恢复困难。尽管强化学习可在不确定性下优化序列决策，但常规 RL 易泛化差且需要为新故障配置或发电模式大量再训练。

Method: 提出 MGF-RL，将一阶元学习与进化策略耦合，学习一个可迁移的初始化，随后通过无梯度的进化策略进行策略搜索以实现快速自适应。该框架在非线性、受约束的配电系统动力学下具有可扩展性，且无需梯度计算。通过历史 outage 经验来获取初始化并在面向未来的场景中快速自适应。

Result: 在 IEEE 13-bus 与 IEEE 123-bus 测试系统上，MGF-RL 的表现优于标准 RL、基于 MAML 的元 RL 以及模型预测控制（MPC），在可靠性、恢复速度和自适应效率等指标上具有优势，且在未见 outage 和可再生模式下具有良好泛化性，同时所需的微调回合数显著少于传统 RL。还给出与任务相似性和环境变化相关的子线性遗憾界，支持经验提升并为在高可再生输入的配电网中进行实时负载恢复提供理论支撑。

Conclusion: MGF-RL 为高可再生输入配电网的实时负载恢复提供了一个高效、可迁移且理论上有界的强化学习框架，兼具良好的适应性与样本效率，与现有方法相比在多场景下表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

TL;DR: 使用大型教师模型提供结构化符号推理标签的蒸馏方法，提升小型代码修复模型的宏平均性能，尤其在罕见错误类型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限情境下的小模型通常只给出单一预测，难以学习程序结构；需要提高可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 以CodeT5为学生模型，采用标签-仅监督和推理蒸馏两种设置；由大教师模型生成符号推理标签与修复类型标签；在IntroClass基准上训练评估。

Result: 蒸馏的推理监督在宏平均上提升性能，且对较少出现的错误类型效果更明显；并且不增加模型容量或复杂度；推理正确性与修复类型预测存在强相关但并非决定性关系。

Conclusion: 符号推理蒸馏是提高轻量级程序修复模型可解释性和鲁棒性的实用途径。

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

### [60] [Constant Metric Scaling in Riemannian Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10992)
*Kisung You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对任意Riemannian流形上的度量进行常数缩放，区分随缩放变化的量与保持不变的几何对象；对Riemannian优化的影响通常表现为步长的全局重新标定，而非几何结构的改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算中经常出现全局标度参数，容易混淆曲率、流形结构或坐标表示的变化。本文意在澄清常数度量缩放的实际影响，为数值实现提供清晰指引。

Method: 自给自足的解释性论文，系统区分受缩放影响的量（范数、距离、体积元、梯度模）与不变的几何对象（勒维-齐维克连接、测地线、指数映射、对行和平移等），并讨论对优化算法的含义。

Result: 给出随缩放变化的量与不变对象的清单，指出缩放等价于步长的全局重新标定，以及在实现中如何在不改动几何结构的前提下应用该缩放。

Conclusion: 全局度量缩放不会改变流形的几何结构，只影响某些量的数值大小；为Riemannian计算提供直观、实用的参考。

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

*Kecheng Cai,Chao Peng,Chenyang Xu,Xia Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-augmented mixture-of-experts for QoS prediction with iterative refinement via partial masking of predictions, enabling inter-expert communication; yields superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate extreme sparsity in user–service feedback by leveraging the model's own predictions to iteratively refine QoS estimates, and by allowing expert networks to communicate and refine outputs.

Method: Introduce a self-augmented strategy that partially masks predicted QoS values and feeds them back as inputs. Build a self-augmented mixture-of-experts (MoE) model where multiple experts iteratively collaborate to estimate QoS. In round two, each expert receives first-round predictions to refine its output, enabling inter-expert communication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

Conclusion: Self-augmented MoE with iterative refinement effectively addresses data sparsity in QoS prediction and enhances predictive accuracy, with a mechanism for inter-expert communication.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series. A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents S2NO, a spectral-spatial neural operator for high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries, integrated with evolutionary optimization for voxel-level material distribution and discretisation-invariant super-resolution design; broadens morphing design capability on irregular domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need accurate, diverse shape-morphing designs on complex geometries (irregular boundaries, porous, thin-walled) for applications like conformal implants and aerodynamic morphing, where existing methods struggle with global-local morphing and discretisation limits.

Method: Introduce S2NO by combining Laplacian eigenfunction encoding with spatial neural operators to capture global and local morphing behaviors on irregular domains. Pair S2NO with evolutionary algorithms for voxel-level optimization of material distributions. Leverage discretisation-invariant properties to enable super-resolution design.

Result: Improved morphing prediction accuracy on complex geometries, enabling voxel-level material distribution optimization across irregular, porous, and thin-walled structures. Demonstrates super-resolution design capabilities due to discretisation invariance, expanding design diversity and complexity.

Conclusion: S2NO advances efficient, diverse programming of complex shape morphing. Its integration with evolutionary optimization expands the feasible design space, and discretisation-invariance enables higher-resolution, more versatile morphing designs.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

TL;DR: 在不集中数据的前提下，通过联邦学习与贝叶斯差分隐私实现生存分析的信用风险模型 FSL-BDP；实验表明在联邦设置下贝叶斯DP的相对收益显著高于集中场景，接近非私有性能，且优于经典DP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨机构数据共享受 GDPR/CCPA 等严格限制；二分类的默认预测忽略时间信息；集中化训练与监管合规冲突；需要一个能保护隐私同时建模时间到默认的框架。

Method: 提出 Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP)，结合联邦学习和数据依赖的贝叶斯差分隐私，对时间到默认进行生存分析建模，避免数据集中化，但提供隐私保护的DP保证。

Result: 在 LendingClub、SBA、Bondora 三个真实数据集上验证：在联邦设置下，贝叶斯DP相较传统DP的收益提升显著 (+7.0% vs +1.4%)，接近非私有性能，且多数客户端优于经典DP；联邦架构改变隐私机制的相对效果排序。

Conclusion: 隐私机制的选择应基于目标部署架构评估，而非单一集中基准；FSL-BDP 为在监管约束下的多机构风险决策提供可操作的隐私保护学习范式。

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

TL;DR: CaMol提出一个面向分子图的因果推理框架，用上下文图、可学习原子掩码和后门调整实现少样本分子性质预测的因果子结构发现与推断，在实验中显示出更好准确性、样本效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在少样本场景下，分子性质预测需要利用先验的功能基团知识并识别与性质直接相关的关键子结构。但现有的快速学习方法往往难以系统地整合化学先验和因果关系，因此难以在未见属性上泛化。

Method: 1) 构建上下文图，连接功能基团、分子与性质，指导因果子结构的发现；2) 引入可学习的原子掩码策略，以从混杂变量中解耦出因果子结构；3) 引入分布干预器，通过后门调整将因果子结构与化学上有据的混杂因素结合，分离因果效应与现实化学变异。

Result: 在多样分子数据集上，CaMol在少样本任务中实现更高的准确性和样本效率，并能泛化到未见性质；发现的因果子结构与功能基团的化学知识高度一致，提升了解释性。

Conclusion: CaMol展示了在分子性质预测中应用因果推理的可行性，能够通过化学知识融入的上下文与混杂处理实现更好的泛化与可解释性。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

*P. Sánchez,K. Reyes,B. Radu,E. Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparative evaluation of supervised vs unsupervised predictive maintenance for helicopter engines; supervised achieves high accuracy with labeled faults, while unsupervised autoencoders detect anomalies without fault labels, beneficial when failure data are scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate practical predictive maintenance in aerospace where fault data and labeling are limited, by comparing a supervised classifier pipeline with an unsupervised autoencoder approach on real telemetry data.

Method: Two pipelines evaluated on real-world telemetry snapshots: (1) supervised classification using labeled normal and faulty data; (2) unsupervised anomaly detection using autoencoders trained on healthy data. Performance assessed on a dataset with labeled snapshots.

Result: Supervised models perform well when fault labels are available; the autoencoder detects anomalies effectively without fault labels, highlighting the viability of unsupervised learning in data-scarce scenarios. Trade-offs observed among accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning, particularly autoencoders, is a viable option for early fault detection in aerospace; method choice depends on data availability and deployment constraints; integrating both approaches could leverage labeled data with unsupervised discovery.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

Conclusion: 首次给出持续SF-UniDA的可比较基线并证明其在多域连续自监督适应中的有效性，提供可复现实现。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Both networks are trained only on healthy data drawn from a minute-level log of 52 sensor channels; evaluation uses a separate set that contains seven annotated fault intervals. Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ 的关键瓶颈在于标定数据的代表性和覆盖性不足，传统方法通常样本有限，难以真实反映推理阶段的激活分布，从而导致量化参数偏差和精度下降。

Method: 1) 将原始标定样本输入同族中更大的一型LLM，生成高保真标定数据；2) 生成数据包含 Chain-of-Thought 推理，且符合目标激活分布；3) 在专家指导下对数据进行分组竞争以筛选出最佳样本，并对选定样本重新归一化以提升 PTQ 效果。

Conclusion: 面向同族大模型的 calibration 数据再生成为 PTQ 提供了有效途径，利用大模型的知识提升量化参数的选择和分布匹配，显示出在大语言模型场景中的潜力与应用价值。

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA) 来应对在联邦学习中对低秩适配器的秩异质性问题。将每个客户端的 LoRA 适配器分解为全局模块（用于可迁移知识的聚合）和本地模块（保留客户端特定性），仅对全局模块进行对齐/聚合并注入差分隐私噪声；本地模块保持私有。实验表明在 GLUE 数据集上优于基线，并具备更优的效用/隐私权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨客户端数据分布异质、不同客户端使用不同低秩配置的情况下，直接聚合 LoRA 更新会产生偏置和不稳定性。现有方法常强制统一秩或尝试对齐到共享子空间，限制个性化并削弱隐私保护。

Method: 将每个客户端的 adapter 拆分为全局模块与本地模块。全局模块用于捕捉可迁移的知识，进行跨客户端的选择性对齐与聚合；本地模块保持私有，不参与聚合。仅对全局模块引入差分隐私噪声以实现隐私保护。该设计在秩异质性条件下实现鲁棒学习并支持隐私感知优化。

Result: 在 GLUE 基准上的实验结果显示，SDFLoRA 优于代表性的联邦 LoRA 基线，且实现更好的效用-隐私权衡。

Conclusion: SDFLoRA 能在存在秩异质性的场景下实现鲁棒的联邦学习，同时兼具隐私感知优化能力，提升个性化与知识迁移之间的平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

TL;DR: A boundary-focused neural operator (MAD-BNO) uses state-synthesized Dirichlet-Neumann data from the problem's fundamental solutions to learn boundary-to-boundary mappings for linear PDEs, enabling interior recovery via boundary integrals with Dirichlet/Neumann/mixed BCs and general sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate dependence on full-domain sampling and external measurements by leveraging known fundamental solutions and enforcing physical consistency through MAD, enabling fully data-driven operator learning from boundary data only.

Method: Train a Boundary Neural Operator (BNO) using Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) to generate Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs from fundamental solutions; learn the boundary-to-boundary mapping; recover interior solutions via boundary integral formulations for varied boundary conditions and source terms; validated on 2D Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz equations.

Result: The MAD-BNO achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator methods while substantially reducing training time; demonstrates robust boundary-data–driven learning and efficient interior evaluation, with natural extension to 3D and complex geometries.

Conclusion: MAD-BNO provides a fully data-driven, boundary-only learning framework for linear PDE operators, leveraging fundamental solutions to synthesize training data and enable efficient interior solution recovery via boundary integrals; scalable to higher dimensions and complex domains.

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

Conclusion: 本工作首次在 agnostic 提升框架中同时达到近似最优的样本复杂度与多项式时间复杂度，为无假设场景下的提升研究提供可行解。

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

TL;DR: FORESTLLM 在少样本表格数据上，将决策森林的结构先验与LLM 的语义推理结合，通过两步设计实现训练时利用LLM并在推理时不使用LLM，达到SOTA的少样本分类/回归性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本表格数据学习的挑战：树模型在有限标注下易过拟合，基于纯度的分裂不稳定；直接使用LLMs忽略结构信息，导致子优性能。

Method: 提出语义分裂准则：LLM 评估候选分割在有标签和无标签数据上的一致性，以诱导更鲁棒、泛化性强的树结构。并提出一次性上下文推理用于叶节点稳定化：LLM 将决策路径及其支持样本蒸馏成简洁的确定性预测，替代带噪的经验估计。训练阶段用LLM设计森林，测试时不需要LLM推理。

Result: 在多种少样本分类与回归基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FORESTLLM 将语义知识编码到轻量级森林中，利用训练时的LLM设计提供结构性偏置，同时实现高效且可解释的推理；适用于高成本标注环境。

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: SPREAD: 在 RAG 框架中通过查询相关引导的去噪策略，稳健地保持语义对齐，显著提升 DLM 的生成精确性并缓解回应语义漂移（RSD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 DLM 与检索增强生成（RAG）结合中的语义漂移问题（RSD），以及在 DLM 解码过程中对语义保持的挑战，填补该领域的研究空缺。

Method: 提出 SPREAD（Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion），引入查询相关性引导的去噪策略，在迭代去噪过程中主动约束生成轨迹，使输出始终与查询语义对齐并抑制漂移；在 RAG 框架中对其进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，SPREAD 能显著提升生成的精确性，降低 RSD 的发生率，并增强对查询的语义保持。

Conclusion: SPREAD 为 DLM 在 RAG 框架中的应用提供了有效的语义稳定位策略，缓解语义漂移，提升生成质量，促进 DLM 与 RAG 的更紧耦合应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Motivation: 在制造与智能工厂等场景，对边缘设备（如 PLC、微控制器）提出低延迟、低内存占用的高质量时间序列预测需求。传统深度模型通常过于庞大，不适合资源受限的边缘部署。

Method: 1) 超轻量级多尺度分解形成频率通路；2) 共享 Dense Temporal Kernel，采用投影-深度卷积-投影的结构且不使用递归或注意力；3) 基于谱特征的频率感知分支门控，动态自适应融合表示；4) 稀疏周期核通过按周期下采样重建输出以捕捉季节性。

Conclusion: 证明在资源受限的边缘硬件上也能实现可靠的长期时间序列预测，为工业实时推理提供可行路径。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

*Lennon Shikhman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic stress-testing framework reveals robustness limits of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) across five PDE families, highlighting vulnerabilities to distribution shifts and resolution changes, and providing a failure-mode atlas for robustness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how FNOs behave under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations, beyond optimizing in-distribution accuracy.

Method: Design controlled stress tests: parameter shifts, boundary/terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts. Evaluate a large-scale suite (1,000 trained models) across five PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems.

Result: Distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by >10x; resolution changes concentrate errors in high-frequency modes; input perturbations rarely amplify error except in worst-case localized perturbations; spectral bias and error compounding observed over rollouts.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive failure-mode atlas and actionable insights to improve robustness of operator-learning methods like FNOs.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Motivation: 在极低计算资源和功耗约束下实现高准确率的ECG分类，并实现跨患者泛化，为可穿戴和植入式设备提供高效、可解释的分类模型。

Method: 使用Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs)与Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs)，引入新的预处理策略以提升跨患者与混合患者两种范式下的性能；提出基于MUX布尔方程的LUT训练方法；首次在LGN/LUTN中引入率编码；在MIT-BIH心律失常数据集的跨患者范式上进行基准测试，并在Artix-7 FPGA上估算资源与功耗（2k–3k LUTs、5–7 mW）。

Result: 在四类分类任务中达到最高94.28%的准确率和jκ=0.683；FLOPs仅2.89k–6.17k，远低于SOTA；FPGA实现需2000–2990 LUTs，推理功耗50–70 pJ/推理，功耗约5–7 mW；相比以往LGN结果有显著提升。

Conclusion: LGN与LUTN具备高精度、极低资源消耗和可在低功耗硬件上实现的潜力，适用于心脏植入或穿戴设备中的实时ECG异常检测，且对未参与训练的患者具有较好鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

Motivation: 当前T1D管理数据集在结构、获取难度和可比性方面存在显著差异，导致数据整合成本高、算法评估受限。

Method: 汇集多份公开T1D数据集，统一为MetaboNet格式。需包含CGM数据和对应的胰岛素给药记录，若可得还保留糖摄入和体力活动等辅助信息。提供可直接下载的完全公开子集以及DUA限制子集，后者附带数据转换管线以统一格式。

Conclusion: 建立了一个广泛可用的T1D研究数据资源，便于跨研究的算法开发、比较与泛化评估。

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

TL;DR: 对无条件扩散模型的分数组合进行系统评估，发现集成通常能提升分数匹配损失和模型似然，但对感知质量指标（如FID）未能获得一致改善；在多种聚合规则下的广泛实验（Deep Ensembles、MC Dropout）覆盖CIFAR-10与FFHQ，且在表格数据上通过随机森林等策略找到表现差异；并给出对分数组合与模型组合（如引导）的理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究将分数模型进行集成是否能提升生成质量，特别是感知质量指标（如FID），，以及理解分数估计与图像质量之间的关系；并扩展到表格数据场景以比较不同聚合策略的通用性。

Method: 使用 Deep Ensembles、Monte Carlo Dropout 等集成方法，比较多种分数组合规则；在 CIFAR-10 与 FFHQ 上评估对数似然、分数匹配损失与感知质量指标（如 FID、IS 等）的影响；同时在表格数据上使用随机森林等聚合策略进行对比；给出关于分数组合和模型组合（包括引导）的理论分析。

Result: 实验表明：集成确实提升分数匹配损失和模型似然，但对 FID 等感知质量指标并不产生稳定的提升；不同聚合规则的效果存在差异，但总体趋势是感知质量与分数估计之间并不直接对应；在表格数据上，某些聚合策略优于其他；理论分析解释了分数组合对模型组合的启示及对指导的影响。

Conclusion: 对无条件扩散模型而言，单纯的集成并非普遍提升感知质量的有效手段，需谨慎选择聚合策略并结合任务特性与理论理解；本文提供了关于分数组合的理论视角，帮助解释为何集成在某些度量上受益而在感知质量上未必有效，并为后续的模型组合技术（包括引导/ guidance）提供了思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

TL;DR: LRKV 是一种低秩 KV 适配的注意力机制，利用跨头的冗余信息在不损失分辨率的前提下显著降低 KV 缓存需求和训练计算量，且保持或提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 预训练中的显存与计算瓶颈，KV 缓存成为训练与自回归解码阶段的核心瓶颈，需通过头间共享与压缩来降低内存开销，同时尽可能保留头部多样性和表达能力。

Method: 在每层中使用一个共享的全秩 KV 投影，并对各头引入低秩的残差项，以实现跨头的部分共享与独立注意力之间的连续折中。LRKV 可直接替换标准多头注意力，覆盖多查询/分组查询等查询共享策略，且与潜在压缩方法（如 MLA）不同。通过大规模预训练实验验证，LRKV 比标准注意力、MQA/GQA 和 MLA 具有更快的损失下降、验证困惑度更低、下游任务表现更好。

Result: 在 25 亿参数规模下，LRKV 使用约一半的 KV 缓存，性能优于标准注意力；在累积 FLOPs 层面实现 20–25% 的训练计算节省，达到与标准注意力相同的模型质量。对注意力头结构的分析显示，LRKV 保留了几乎全部的头部功能多样性，而更激进的 KV 共享需要通过查询头的分化来补偿。

Conclusion: LRKV 为在受内存与计算约束的情形下扩展 Transformer 预训练提供了一个实用且有效的注意力机制，能够作为替代选项提升效率与性能。

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

Method: Vector database integrating papers, government sources, news, and social media; Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; automated report generation with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user-interaction pattern identification.

Result: Single-turn evaluation: relevance 4.83, routing 4.89, reference quality 4.50, correctness 4.90, professional identity 4.88 (overall 4.80); multi-turn: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, overall 4.98; report generation: completeness 4.00–5.00, correctness 4.00–5.00, helpfulness 3.67–5.00, reference validity 5.00 across periods.

Conclusion: Feasible integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication; delivers verified information with source attribution while enabling systematic public discourse analysis; transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.

TL;DR: LLMs implicitly encode perceived trustworthiness cues in web-like narratives; activation patterns distinguish high- vs low-trust texts; pretraining encodes trust cues; fine-tuning refines rather than rewrites representations; strongest links with fairness, certainty, and accountability-self; supports building credible, transparent AI in the web ecosystem.

Motivation: Address how instruction-tuned LLMs represent psychologically grounded trust in online information and whether such trust constructs emerge without explicit supervision, with implications for credibility and transparency in web AI systems.

Method: Analyze instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Examine layer- and head-level activations to distinguish high- and low-trust narratives, perform probing to assess linear decodability of trust signals, and evaluate the effects of fine-tuning. Compare pretraining-encoded representations to fine-tuned adjustments.

Result: Across models, activation differences at certain layers/heads distinguish high- from low-trust texts; trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing reveals linearly decodable trust signals; fine-tuning refines rather than restructures these representations. Strongest associations with appraisal dimensions of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, providing a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trustworthy AI systems in the web ecosystem; code and appendix available at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

TL;DR: CTHA提出将多时间尺度层间通信映射到结构化流形上，通过三类约束实现层间协调稳定性，并引入仲裁机制，显著提升性能与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多时间尺度架构引发的层间冲突、错误传播和可扩展性瓶颈，提供一个统一、可约束的协调框架。

Method: 在层间通信中引入消息契约约束、权威流形约束和仲裁分辨约束，将信息流、决策空间和决策组合进行结构化和约束化，并通过一个仲裁器实现无冲突的多层决策组合。

Result: 在复杂任务上表现良好：失败级连减少47%、样本效率提升2.3倍、相较无约束基线具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: CTHA作为对时间层级的原理性扩展，有助于理解多智能体协调，并为稳健自治系统的发展提供方向。

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

Motivation: 现有主流一 shot embodied tasks 关注任务完成，忽略探索过程与记忆的利用，缺乏长期情境下的记忆驱动决策能力，需支持终身学习与长期任务表现。

Method: 提出 Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE) 框架，构建 LMEE-Bench 数据集与基准（多目标导航与基于记忆的问答），MemoryExplorer 通过强化学习微调多模态大语言模型，结合行动预测、前沿选择和问答三项奖励以促进主动记忆查询与探索。

Conclusion: 将记忆驱动的探索与长期决策融合，推动面向终身学习的具备长期任务能力的 embodied 智能体研究；LMEE-Bench 提供全面评估，MemoryExplorer 提升记忆召回与主动探索能力。

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏定量数据时仍可对复杂创新过程进行建模与分析，提供一个信息量最小化的定性框架，以捕捉情景的演化及潜在路径。

Method: 以简单趋势（增加、减少、不变）作为量化标准，构建情景集合及其转移关系的图结构；将系统演化描述为从一组情景到另一组情景的路径。

Result: 提出一个将解定义为带转移图的情景集合的框架，使系统的任意未来或历史行为均可通过图中的路径表示，达到在无数值信息条件下对创新过程的定性建模。

Conclusion: 该框架将启发式趋势与转移图结合，提供一个不依赖数值参数的定性建模工具，以捕捉复杂产品创新过程的潜在轨迹与情景演化。

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

TL;DR: 在数据高效的视觉-语言推理中，该研究通过 DCVLR 挑战分析数据选取，发现难度驱动的样本选择是性能提升的主因，数据量扩大在固定训练方案下只降低方差，常用的多样性与合成增强对性能无增益，甚至有时有害；DCVLR 属于饱和区评估，关键在于对齐与难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索数据中心因素在多模态推理中的作用，特别是在固定模型和训练协议的设定下，理解数据集选择、样本难度、大小、多样性对性能的影响。

Method: 以 Walton Multimodal Cold Start 为基础，构建一个紧凑且经过筛选的训练集；在比赛后做消融实验，比较对齐基线数据集上的难度驱动样本选择、数据集规模、数据多样性、合成增强等因素的影响，评估均值准确率与方差。

Result: 难度驱动的样本选择成为性能提升的主导因素；在固定训练方案下，增加数据集规模并不可靠地提升均值准确率，反而降低方差以外的收益；多样性与合成增强策略常无增益甚至降低性能。

Conclusion: DCVLR 是一个饱和- regime 的数据评估设置，数据效率提升的关键在于样本对齐与难度设计，而非单纯扩大数据量或引入额外的多样性/增强。

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: HADES 将哈密顿动力学融入贝叶斯优化，用结构感知的后验近似来高效采样连续状态中的离散蛋白序列；通过两阶段编码解码器学习结构-功能关系，获得比现有方法更优的设计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质优化受高维表位效应(epistasis)和结构约束的共同制约，纯序列信息优化难以捕获结构约束与序列之间的耦合关系，亟需整合结构信息以提升探索效率与设计质量。

Method: 提出 HADES：基于哈密顿动力学的贝叶斯优化框架，利用动量与不确定性引导提案跨越狭窄的高潜在区域；引入位置离散化将连续状态转化为离散蛋白序列；以双阶段编码-解码器来建模变体邻域的结构-功能关系，从而学习平滑化的适应性景观用于采样。

Conclusion: 将结构信息整合到后验采样与序列离散化中，显著提高蛋白设计的探索效率与设计质量，具备在生物领域的应用潜力；但需结合实验验证以验证真实世界的可转化性。

Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgencyBench is a benchmark for evaluating multi-capability autonomous agents across 32 real-world scenarios with 138 tasks, addressing long-horizon behavior and automated evaluation via user-simulated feedback and Docker sandbox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single capabilities and rely on human-in-the-loop feedback, limiting scalability for automated rollout and evaluation; demand for long-horizon, multi-capability assessment in realistic settings.

Method: Derives a benchmark from daily AI usage; evaluates 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 scenarios, 138 tasks; orchestrates ~90 tool calls, 1M tokens, hours of execution; uses a user simulation agent for iterative feedback; uses Docker sandbox for rubric-based assessment; analyzes resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, tool-use preferences; compares closed- vs open-source models; investigates agentic scaffolds and ecosystem effects; releases code.

Result: Experimental results show closed-source models outperform open-source (48.4% vs 32.1%); significant variation across models in efficiency and self-correction; proprietary models peak within their ecosystems; open-source models respond differently to execution frameworks; ~90 tool calls per scenario, implying heavy long-horizon tasks; the benchmark and toolkit released.

Conclusion: AgencyBench provides a critical testbed emphasizing co-optimization of model architectures with agent frameworks, and highlights future directions for scalable, automated evaluation and development of autonomous agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

*Zhezheng Hao,Hong Wang,Jian Luo,Jianqing Zhang,Yuyan Zhou,Qiang Lin,Can Wang,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCreate: an experience-driven framework for automatic domain agent creation that learns from agent interaction histories to generate reusable patterns and scaffold edits, outperforming human-designed agents and prior automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated agent generation often treats creation as a black-box optimization guided only by final performance, neglecting diagnostic signals from interaction histories. This leads to higher costs and less explainability. There is a need to leverage rich experiential signals to explain successes/failures and guide iterative improvement.

Method: Proposes agent-as-optimizer with three components: (i) experience storage/retrieval for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract per-instance details into reusable domain patterns.

Result: Experimental results across diverse domains show ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent-generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

Conclusion: ReCreate demonstrates that exploiting interaction histories enables automatic domain agent creation and adaptation that is more effective and efficient than prior approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

TL;DR: 提出 SCALE，一种基于自预测和少量校准的任务级工作流生成与评估框架，在多智能体系统中相比全执行验证显著降低成本且性能接近现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型驱动的多智能体系统中，工作流的生成与评估通常分为任务级或查询级，但两者的代价、可比性与鲁棒性尚不清晰。基于全执行验证的评估成本高、往往不稳定，需要更高效的评估信号。

Method: 提出 SCALE（Self prediction of the optimizer with few shot Calibration for Evaluation），通过自我预测优化器并进行少量示例校准来评估任务级工作流，而非进行完整的执行验证，结合自我进化和生成奖励建模的思想以降低代价。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SCALE 的平均性能下降仅为 0.61%，显著低于对比方法，同时总 token 使用量降低可达约 83%。

Conclusion: 通过任务级生成与少量校准的评估，SCALE 提供了高成本效益的工作流生成与评估方案，适用于大规模 MAS 场景，且在保持竞争力的前提下降低 token 成本。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

TL;DR: 将有害叙事的多模态检测从二分类转化为结构化推理，通过并行强化学习实现跨模态对齐与时间尺度上的可解释证据提供，显著提升目标识别的准确性并保持精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统多为“黑箱”式检测，难以提供可解释的证据（如具体时间戳、目标身份等），在需要人机协同的在线安全 moderated 场景中缺乏透明性与可追溯性。长时序多模态内容增加了推理复杂性，需对齐音视频与文本信息以实现可解释的判断。

Method: 提出 TANDEM 框架：通过一种成对的跨模态强化学习（vision-language 与 audio-language 模型互相优化），在自约束的跨模态上下文中稳定地进行长序列推理，且不需密集帧级标注。在 HateMM 等三个基准数据集上进行评估，强调目标识别的结构化证据与时间定位。

Result: 在零样本与上下文增强基线上显著超越；在 HateMM 的目标识别任务达到 0.73 的 F1 值，比现有方法提升约 30%，并保持精确的时间定位。进一步发现二分类检测鲁棒，但在多类设置下区分 Offensive 与 Hateful 存在挑战，原因包括标签歧义与数据集不平衡。

Conclusion: 证明了在复杂多模态场景中也可实现结构化、可解释的对齐，为面向透明、可操作的在线安全 moderation 工具提供了实现蓝图。

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Think-with-Me introduces a test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that injects external feedback at transitional conjunction points to guide LRMs, using GRPO for training. It achieves a favorable accuracy–reasoning-length trade-off on AIME24 (7.19% accuracy gain vs QwQ-32B, 81% shorter reasoning under 8K context) and extends to security and creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs exhibit multi-step reasoning efficiency issues (overthinking/overshoot). Existing efficient methods operate in a closed loop with no external guidance. There is a need for a mechanism to intervene in the reasoning process to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Introduce Think-with-Me: pause reasoning at transitional conjunctions (markers indicating self-validation or exploration phases) to obtain external feedback. Use transitional words to modulate reasoning length. Feedback (rationality and completeness) comes from human or LLM proxies. Adaptively extend or terminate reasoning based on feedback. Train the model with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to align with interactive mode.

Result: Empirical results show Think-with-Me achieves a better accuracy–length balance under limited context windows. On AIME24, it outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% accuracy and reduces average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. Additional benefits observed on security and creative tasks.

Conclusion: External feedback interventions at strategic points can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of large reasoning models. The GRPO-trained policy adapts well to the interactive mode. The approach shows promise under resource-constrained settings but requires further validation on more tasks and analysis of feedback cost and quality.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越仅看结果的对齐（如准确率、F1），通过可解释的决策因素、约束敏感性和权衡来诊断对齐程度，揭示不同模型、选项和子群体间的差异与偏差。

Method: 对人类数据与大模型生成的决策同时拟合机制型决策模型，提取可解释参数（决策因素的重要性、约束敏感度、隐含权衡），通过跨模型、选项与子群体比较参数向量来评估对齐。以美国人日常时间分配（ATUS）作为人类基准，进行鲁棒性分析（不变性分析）并评估以检索增强生成（RAG）干预的缓解效果。

Result: 揭示模型/活动间的异质性对齐，且在黑人群体和已婚群体中存在显著的错配。通过不变性分析验证方法的鲁棒性，并显示 RAG 干预在目标领域的潜在缓解效应。提供机制型度量用于诊断错配并支持超越表面结果匹配的改进。

Conclusion: XChoice 提供面向机制的对齐诊断工具，帮助研究者在决策约束情境下深入理解与改进 AI-人类的对齐，而不仅仅依赖简单的结果匹配。

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint programming求解器对超参数极度敏感，手工调参成本高且需要专业知识，需一个自动、资源感知的调参框架来提升鲁棒性与性能。

Method: 将可用时间分为探测阶段和求解阶段，探测阶段使用可配置的超参数优化方法（贝叶斯优化或汉明距离搜索）探索不同参数集；求解阶段使用在剩余时间内的最佳配置求解问题。实现并比较两种优化方法，针对ACE和Choco进行114个实例的评估，并与默认配置对比。

Result: 使用贝叶斯优化时，ACE在25.4%的实例上提高解的质量，57.9%的实例达到与默认相同的性能；Choco上在38.6%的实例上获得更优结果。汉明距离搜索在同框架中表现不如贝叶斯优化。整体表明该框架能在多样问题类型上提供稳健的改进。

Conclusion: probe-and-solve提供一种实用、资源感知的CP求解器调优方法，基于模型的探索优于局部搜索，能够在不同问题类型上获得鲁棒的改进。

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.
