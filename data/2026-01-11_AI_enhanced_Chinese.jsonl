However, this setting is fraught with the persistent challenge of false negatives, where unobserved user-item interactions are not necessarily indicative of negative preference. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel and principled loss function, named Corrected and Weighted (CW) loss, that systematically corrects for the impact of false negatives within the training objective. Our approach integrates two key techniques. First, inspired by Positive-Unlabeled learning, we debias the negative sampling process by re-calibrating the assumed negative distribution. By theoretically approximating the true negative distribution (p-) using the observable general data distribution (p) and the positive interaction distribution (p^+), our method provides a more accurate estimate of the likelihood that a sampled unlabeled item is truly negative. Second, we introduce a dynamic re-weighting mechanism that modulates the importance of each negative instance based on the model's current prediction. This scheme encourages the model to enforce a larger ranking margin between positive items and confidently predicted (i.e., easy) negative items, while simultaneously down-weighting the penalty on uncertain negatives that have a higher probability of being false negatives. A key advantage of our approach is its elegance and efficiency; it requires no complex modifications to the data sampling process or significant computational overhead, making it readily applicable to a wide array of existing recommendation models. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, sparse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed loss. The results show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art loss functions across multiple ranking-oriented metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Corrected and Weighted (CW) \u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 PU \u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u53bb\u504f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u9634\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5047\u9634\u6027\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e00\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\uff081\uff09\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u504f\uff1a\u4ee5\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5206\u5e03 p \u4e0e\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03 p^+ \u63a8\u5bfc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u8d1f\u5206\u5e03 p-\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u9879\u4e3a\u8d1f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7684\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u8d4b\u4e88\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u201c\u6613\u8d1f\u201d\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u8fb9\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e3a\u5047\u9634\u6027\u7684\u201c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u201d\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u4e14\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCW \u635f\u5931\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "CW \u635f\u5931\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5177\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most studies treat this task as a distinct research line, e.g., focusing on prompt design for predicting relevance labels given a query and passage. However, predicting relevance judgments is essentially a form of relevance prediction, a problem extensively studied in tasks such as re-ranking. Despite this potential overlap, little research has explored reusing or adapting established re-ranking methods to predict relevance judgments, leading to potential resource waste and redundant development. To bridge this gap, we reproduce re-rankers in a re-ranker-as-relevance-judge setup. We design two adaptation strategies: (i) using binary tokens (e.g., \"true\" and \"false\") generated by a re-ranker as direct judgments, and (ii) converting continuous re-ranking scores into binary labels via thresholding. We perform extensive experiments on TREC-DL 2019 to 2023 with 8 re-rankers from 3 families, ranging from 220M to 32B, and analyse the evaluation bias exhibited by re-ranker-based judges. Results show that re-ranker-based relevance judges, under both strategies, can outperform UMBRELA, a state-of-the-art LLM-based relevance judge, in around 40% to 50% of the cases; they also exhibit strong self-preference towards their own and same-family re-rankers, as well as cross-family bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u5b9a\u8005\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u76f4\u63a5\u7684LLM\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728TREC-DL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u6cd5\u572840-50%\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8eUMBRELA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u5206\u79bb\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u5b9a\u8005\u4ee5\u590d\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u201c\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u5373\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u5b9a\u8005\u201d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u9020\uff1a (i) \u4f7f\u7528\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6807\u8bb0\uff08\u5982 true/false\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u5224\u5b9a\uff1b (ii) \u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u6570\u901a\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5bf98\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea3\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece2.2e8\u52303.2e10\u7684\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u5728TREC-DL 2019\u20132023\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eUMBRELA\u7b49LLM\u57fa\u7840\u5224\u5b9a\u5668\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u5bb6\u5224\u522b\u3001\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u5b9a\u8005\u572840%-50%\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eUMBRELA\uff1b\u5224\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u53ca\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u7528\u518d\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u4ece\u96f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684LLM\u5224\u5b9a\u5668\u66f4\u5177\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external knowledge, conventional single-shot retrieval often fails to resolve complex biomedical queries requiring multi-step inference. To address this, we propose Self-MedRAG, a self-reflective hybrid framework designed to mimic the iterative hypothesis-verification process of clinical reasoning. Self-MedRAG integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy, combining sparse (BM25) and dense (Contriever) retrievers via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to maximize evidence coverage. It employs a generator to produce answers with supporting rationales, which are then assessed by a lightweight self-reflection module using Natural Language Inference (NLI) or LLM-based verification. If the rationale lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the system autonomously reformulates the query and iterates to refine the context. We evaluated Self-MedRAG on the MedQA and PubMedQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our hybrid retrieval approach significantly outperforms single-retriever baselines.

However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u8bc1\u636e\u79ef\u7d2f\u6a21\u578b\uff08EAM\uff09\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u773c\u52a8\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027/\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u503e\u5411\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u60c5\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86EAM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u9a8c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u503e\u5411\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd plausibly portray \u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u5c06\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u4e0e\u6240\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc1\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u503e\u5411\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06EAM\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u652f\u6491\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \"Parameter-Space Intervention\" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance.

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e92\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u672a\u9884\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u6211\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56e0\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u79ef\u7d2f\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Actively Feedback Getting\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u83b7\u53d6\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u884c\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u9988\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u52a8\u4ee5\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u805a\u7126\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u4e3b\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e0\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u79ef\u7d2f\uff1b\u81ea\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u83b7\u53d6\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5934\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 Transformer \u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u524a\u51cf\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5ffd\u7565 Transformer \u7684\u5934\u90e8\u5c42\u6b21\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u89e3\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa pre-alignment \u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5934\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u540e\u5b9e\u65bd\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u51b2\u7a81\u5728\u5934\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u6765\u81ea\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u529b\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u5934\u90e8\u7ea7\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd interpretable\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c40\u90e8\u5934\u90e8\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3002"}}

This \"dark data\" problem is exacerbated by the operational cost of model updates: jointly fine-tuning query and document encoders requires re-indexing the entire corpus, which is prohibitive in multi-tenant environments with thousands of isolated indices. To address these dual challenges, we introduce \\textbf{DevRev Search}, a passage retrieval benchmark for technical customer support constructed through a fully automatic pipeline.

Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy.

However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models.

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees.

We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding. The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems.

These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks.

Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution. Extensive experiments on real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the optimal architectures discovered by our OSCD model for CD tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa OSCD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5f0f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u952e\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u7ed3\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4f53\u79ef\u5316\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u201c\u5927\u7f51\u201d\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807 Pareto \u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5bfb\u627e\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u53cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u67b6\u6784\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u8d85\u7f51\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOSCD\u6240\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "OSCD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u542b\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u9886\u57df\u5185\u641c\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material.

We provide a systematic analysis of Google search engine query suggestions for European and national politicians. Using an original dataset of search query suggestions for European politicians collected in ten countries, we find that query suggestions are less stable over time in politicians' countries of origin, when the politicians hold a supranational role, and for female politicians.

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u52a1-\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff1a\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u8fbe\u6210100%\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ec56.7%\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u4ee5120\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3001\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e09\u5927\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u4e5f\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u591a-hop \u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caMoE/\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5f25\u8865\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5171120\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff1aLLaMA-3 8B\u3001LLaMA-2 13B\u3001Mixtral 8x7B\u3001DeepSeek-V2 16B\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u62ecp\u503c\uff09\u4e0e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u4ec5\u5728\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u73b0\uff1a\u5bf9LLaMA-3 8B\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u8fbe\u5230p<0.001\uff0c\u5bf9Mixtral\u4e3ap=0.014\uff0c\u589e\u76ca\u53ef\u8fbe46.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u8f83\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u5f25\u8865\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff1aMixtral\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5176\u7ea612B\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f47B\u7684\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7531\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u201d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1aLLaMA-3 8B\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8eLLaMA-2 13B\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0eMoE \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431\u5316\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Therefore, most systems adopt a \\emph{gather-and-refine} strategy, where a lightweight gather phase selects candidates for full scoring. However, this approach requires expensive searches over large token-level indexes and often misses the documents that would rank highest under full similarity. In this paper, we reproduce several state-of-the-art multivector retrieval methods on two publicly available datasets, providing a clear picture of the current multivector retrieval field and observing the inefficiency of token-level gathering. Building on top of that, we show that replacing the token-level gather phase with a single-vector document retriever -- specifically, a learned sparse retriever (LSR) -- produces a smaller and more semantically coherent candidate set. This recasts the gather-and-refine pipeline into the well-established two-stage retrieval architecture. As retrieval latency decreases, query encoding with two neural encoders becomes the dominant computational bottleneck. To mitigate this, we integrate recent inference-free LSR methods, demonstrating that they preserve the retrieval effectiveness of the dual-encoder pipeline while substantially reducing query encoding time. Finally, we investigate multiple reranking configurations that balance efficiency, memory, and effectiveness, and we introduce two optimization techniques that prune low-quality candidates early. Empirical results show that these techniques improve retrieval efficiency by up to 1.8$\\times$ with no loss in quality. Overall, our two-stage approach achieves over $24\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art multivector retrieval systems, while maintaining comparable or superior retrieval quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7 gathering\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff08LSR\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u7684LSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5019\u9009\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u5168\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8ba9\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u66f4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u590d\u73b0\u82e5\u5e72SOTA\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7528\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff08LSR\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7 gathering; \u6574\u5408\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65e0\u5173\uff08inference-free\uff09LSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u9879\u526a\u679d\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8fbe\u7ea624\u00d7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe1.8\u00d7\uff0c\u4e14\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u805a\u96c6\u9636\u6bb5\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408LSR\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3a\u4eca\u540e\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa RLMIL-DAT\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684 utterance \u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002 \u5728\u4e94\u8bed\u8a00Twitter\u548c VoxCeleb2 \u6d3e\u751f\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c/0-shot \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 Macro F1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u3002 \u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u82f1\u8bed\u5411\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b0-shot \u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u53d7\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u7387\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u660e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u7684 RLMIL-DAT\uff1a\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u8bed\u8a00Twitter\u548c VoxCeleb2 \u6d3e\u751f\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRLMIL-DAT \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347 Macro F1\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6 MIL \u4e0e\u539f\u59cb RMIL\uff1b\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u6536\u76ca\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f46\u4e3a\u6b63\u5411\uff1b Ablation \u6307\u51fa\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u5728\u5c0f\u578b VoxCeleb2 \u76840-shot \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u666e\u904d\u4e3a\u6b63\u4f46\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u672a\u89c1\u8bed\u8a00\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u660e\u6b64\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4ece\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5411\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low-priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality.

Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spatial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations. Using these signals, our method adaptively adjusts the confidence threshold for every token at every step.

Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains.

While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56db\u5927\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8LLMs\u5728 propositional reasoning \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1a\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u4e13\u95e8\u6ce8\u610f\u5934\uff1b\u6b64\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aLLMs\u5728\u547d\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9Qwen3\uff088B \u4e0e 14B\uff09\u5728PropLogic-MI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u8986\u76d611\u79cd\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u8df3\u4e0e\u4e8c\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u5c42\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u805a\u5408\u3001\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u56de\u6eaf\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u5316\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u5934\u7b49\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1a\u56db\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u6eaf\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u5934\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u81ea\u6d3d\u5730\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u547d\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8fd9\u56db\u5927\u673a\u5236\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5f15\u3002"}}

This paper addresses the issues of response time and information accuracy by proposing an AI system integrating a fine-tuned language model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG effectively retrieves relevant information from large datasets, its performance in narrow, complex domains like university admissions can be limited without adaptation, potentially leading to contextually inadequate responses due to the intricate rules and specific details involved. To overcome this, we fine-tuned the model on a curated dataset specific to admissions processes, enhancing its ability to interpret RAG-provided data accurately and generate domain-relevant outputs. This hybrid approach leverages RAG's ability to access up-to-date information and fine-tuning's capacity to embed nuanced domain understanding. We further explored optimization strategies for the response generation logic, experimenting with settings to balance response quality and speed, aiming for consistently high-quality outputs that meet the specific requirements of admissions communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fine-tuned LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for university admissions inquiries to improve response time and information accuracy; emphasizes domain adaptation and generation-logic optimization.", "motivation": "Address high inquiry volumes in university admissions while maintaining accurate, timely information and positive prospective-student perception.", "method": "Hybrid approach: fine-tune a language model on a curated admissions dataset and integrate with RAG to fetch up-to-date information; explore response-generation settings to balance quality and speed.", "result": "No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the work outlines the approach and anticipated benefits without quantitative evaluation.", "conclusion": "A hybrid RAG+domain-fine-tuned system is proposed to enhance accuracy and timeliness of admissions responses, with optimization of generation logic; empirical validation is required."}}

This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians.

However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEGATO \u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u795e\u7ecfODE\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6743\u91cd\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u7eed forgetting \u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u5728\u5185\u57df\u4e0e\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb forgetting \u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u5fae\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0a\u9888\u90e8\u9644\u52a0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u795e\u7ecfODE\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u51bb\u7ed3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574ODE\u6b65\u957f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u57df\u548c\u5916\u57df\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cLEGATO\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the \"elbow points\" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages.

We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained.

Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite.

We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions (\"position shift\") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup.

One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u81ea\u53d1\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u6b65\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SVM/MLP/EEGNet\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u5408\u7ed3\u5408\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u540e\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u96c6\u5408\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f2a\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u96c6\u5408\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u53d1\u6027\u5eb7\u590d\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u540e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63d0\u524d\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5305\u542b14\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u4e24\u7ec4\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u53d1\u81c2\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83SVM\u3001MLP\u3001EEGNet\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u7a97\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f2a\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u7740\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u96c6\u5408\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u5408\u9002\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5e45\u5ea6\u5927\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u65e9\u671f\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR).

Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\uff08online action-stacking\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06RL\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u77ed\u4fc3\u539f\u59cb\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u6253\u5305\u6210\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u6291\u5236\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c11\u4e14\u66f4\u6709\u8282\u594f\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d0\u5347ATC\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u89e3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\uff08ATC\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9891\u5ea6\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f7fRL\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fd0\u8425\u8981\u6c42\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Proximal Policy Optimization\uff08PPO\uff09\u4e0eBluebirdDT\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u504f\u822a\u6216\u722c\u5347/\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u6291\u5236\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6307\u4ee4\u9891\u7387\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06 bursts \u7684\u539f\u59cb\u52a8\u4f5c\u6253\u5305\u6210\u57df\u5185\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6e05\u6670\uff08clearances\uff09\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u5305\u62ec\u6a2a\u5411\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u722c\u5347/\u4e0b\u964d\u81f3\u76ee\u6807\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5206\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u673a\u907f\u649e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a2a\u5411\u5bfc\u822a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53d1\u51fa\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e26\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\u5c31\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u4f7f\u752837\u7ef4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\u4e3a\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645ATC\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u642d\u8d77\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The method identifies language-associated latent units using cross-language activation statistics, suppresses these units at inference time, and reconstructs embeddings in the original dimensionality, making it compatible with existing vector databases without retraining the base encoder or re-encoding raw text.

This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57281\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5d4c\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u4e94\u4e2a\u751f\u7406\u4e9a\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "HbA1c\u7b49\u5355\u4e00 biomarker \u96be\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0T1D \u7684\u4ee3\u8c22\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6574\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u8840\u7cd6\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6307\u6807\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u4e9a\u578b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06CGM\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6307\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u8c22\u8868\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0eSHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728577\u540dT1D\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa5\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u8c22\u8868\u578b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4ece\u4ee3\u8c22\u7a33\u5b9a\u5230\u5347\u9ad8\u5fc3\u4ee3\u8c22\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\uff1b\u5404\u8868\u578b\u5728\u7cd6\u63a7\u3001\u8102\u8d28\u4ee3\u8c22\u3001\u80be\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3001TSH\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cSHAP \u53d1\u73b0HbA1c\u3001\u7518\u6cb9\u4e09\u916f\u3001\u603b\u80c6\u56fa\u9187\u3001\u808c\u9150\u3001TSH\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u8868\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8868\u578b\u6210\u5458\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u3001\u5fc3\u808c\u6897\u6b7b\u3001\u5fc3\u529b\u8870\u7aed\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5e45\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u7406\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684T1D\u4ee3\u8c22\u4e9a\u7fa4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e00\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable \"rhythm generator\" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.\n  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.\n  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).\n  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.", "AI": {"tldr": "Phasor Agents leverage Stuart-Landau oscillators with three-factor plasticity to achieve stable online learning in oscillatory networks, using wake-sleep separation and REM-like replay; shows strong improvements across ablations and reveals Tolman-style latent learning; code open-source.", "motivation": "Address stability and credit-assignment challenges in dynamical, oscillatory substrates; enable robust, scalable learning without backpropagation.", "method": "Model: Phasor Graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators; phases encode relative timing; amplitudes encode local activity.

Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation.

Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06SCM\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u8eab\u4efd\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u548c\u6216\u62fc\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u53c9\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\uff08Word2Vec\u3001GloVe\u3001Numberbatch\uff09\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\uff08Subtraction\u3001Linear Projection\u3001Partial Projection\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7c7b\u6bd4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u504f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u53c9\u8eab\u4efd\u590d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff08\u6c42\u548c/\u62fc\u63a5\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u5e94\u7528 Subtraction\u3001Linear Projection\u3001Partial Projection \u4e09\u79cd\u53bb\u504f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83 Word2Vec\u3001GloVe\u3001ConceptNet Numberbatch\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4fdd\u6301\u5ea6\u4e24\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aSCM \u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u8eab\u4efd\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u7c7b\u6bd4\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1bPartial Projection \u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0cLinear Projection \u66f4\u5177\u8fdb\u53d6\u6027\uff0cSubtraction \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6c42\u548c\u4e0e\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e SCM \u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53bb\u504f\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u53bb\u504f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation.

To expose this selective safety, we introduce MiJaBench, a bilingual (English and Portuguese) adversarial benchmark comprising 44,000 prompts across 16 minority groups. By generating 528,000 prompt-response pairs from 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, we curate MiJaBench-Align, revealing that safety alignment is not a generalized semantic capability but a demographic hierarchy: defense rates fluctuate by up to 33\\% within the same model solely based on the target group. Crucially, we demonstrate that model scaling exacerbates these disparities, suggesting that current alignment techniques do not create principle of non-discrimination but reinforces memorized refusal boundaries only for specific groups, challenging the current scaling laws of security. We release all datasets and scripts to encourage research into granular demographic alignment at GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MiJaBench\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u82f1\u8bed/\u8461\u8bed\u7684\u5bf9\u7acb\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6 16 \u4e2a\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684 44,000 \u6761\u63d0\u793a\u53ca 528,000 \u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30 12 \u79cd SOTA LLM \u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6309\u76ee\u6807\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c42\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u201c\u666e\u904d\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9762\u5411\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa MiJaBench\uff08\u82f1\u6587/\u8461\u8404\u7259\u6587\u53cc\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b 44,000 \u6761\u63d0\u793a\u8986\u76d6 16 \u4e2a\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1b\u81ea 12 \u79cd\u524d\u6cbf LLM \u751f\u6210 528,000 \u6761\u63d0\u793a-\u5e94\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210 MiJaBench-Align\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u8fbe ~33%\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u975e\u6b67\u89c6\u539f\u5219\u201d\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86 memorized \u62d2\u7edd\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u811a\u672c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8fdb\u884c\u7c92\u5ea6\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u666e\u904d\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u9897\u7c92\u5316\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u8b66\u793a\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e76\u4e0d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u7fa4\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u64a4\u56de\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

We construct the free hypergraph category \\(\\Syn_\u03a3\\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \\(\\cat{Mat}_R\\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \\(\\int\\Msg \\to \\cat{FG}_\u03a3\\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \\(O(n^2 d_{\\max} + c \\cdot k_{\\max} \\cdot \u03b4_{\\max}^3 + n \\cdot \u03b4_{\\max}^2)\\) for \\(n\\) factors and \\(c\\) fundamental cycles.

RLV$^\\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?\n  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time (\"rate, not fate\"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary.

But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals.

While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5378\u8f7d\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002 \u5728\u5bf9 Iris \u4e0e Covertype \u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u5300\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u5747\u5300\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u524a\u51cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5378\u8f7d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5378\u8f7d\uff1b\u89e3\u8026\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u7ef4\u6301\u9009\u5b9a\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u4e0e\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u4e0a\u6709\u9650\u5236\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Iris \u4e0e Covertype \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u3001\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\u76ee\u6807\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We study this through next-turn dialogue prediction: given a conversation, predict the next utterance produced by a person. We compare learning approaches along two dimensions: (1) whether the model is allowed to think before responding, and (2) how learning is rewarded either through an LLM-as-a-judge that scores semantic similarity and information completeness relative to the ground-truth response, or by directly maximizing the log-probability of the true human dialogue. We find that optimizing for judge-based rewards indeed increases judge scores throughout training, however it decreases the likelihood assigned to ground truth human responses and decreases the win rate when human judges choose the most human-like response among a real and synthetic option. This failure is amplified when the model is allowed to think before answering. In contrast, by directly maximizing the log-probability of observed human responses, the model learns to better predict what people actually say, improving on both log-probability and win rate evaluations. Treating chain-of-thought as a latent variable, we derive a lower bound on the log-probability. Optimizing this objective yields the best results on all our evaluations. These results suggest that thinking helps primarily when trained with a distribution-matching objective grounded in real human dialogue, and that scaling this approach to broader conversational data may produce models with a more nuanced understanding of human behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u5141\u8bb8\u201c\u601d\u8003\u540e\u518d\u7b54\u201d\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u6709\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u5b9a\u7684\u80dc\u7387\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u80dc\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5c06chain-of-thought\u89c6\u4e3a\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u4eba\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u601d\u8003\u201d\uff08chain-of-thought\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u7f5a\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1a\u662f\u5426\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u201c\u601d\u8003\u201d\uff1b\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08LLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5e76\u5c06chain-of-thought\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5206\u6570\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9 ground-truth \u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u5b9a\u7684\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u601d\u8003\u5728\u6b64\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u589e\u5e45\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bf4\u8bdd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0e\u80dc\u7387\uff1b\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u601d\u8003\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff1b\u5c06\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u6210\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u66f4\u7ec6\u817b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions.

However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684SEI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60 + \u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u76d1\u7763 + \u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5b57\u5178\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SEI\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u9636\u6bb51\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5b57\u5178\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u53d6\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u9636\u6bb52\uff1a\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u9636\u6bb53\uff1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u4ece\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u5177\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADS-B\u548cWiFi\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347SEI\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b\u81ea\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u662f\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.", "AI": {"tldr": "Embedding-based models with LLM-generated summaries enable scalable detection of socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) in collaborative modeling; text-only embeddings outperform for enactment/group dynamics, while contextual/multimodal features help planning and reflection; enables real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding.", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u8303\u7574\u81f3\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684SSRL\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u548cLLMs\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6458\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u628a\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e5\u5fd7\u6d3e\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4bSSRL\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u4e13\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684SSRL\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u8131\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e2e\u52a9\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u7b49\u6784\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9SSRL\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9SSRL\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6559\u5e08\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u67b6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level.

The LLM is kept frozen and the embedding is optimized with the standard language-modeling objective. We evaluate Concept Tokens in three settings. First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional \"Austral Tower\" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge.

We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism.

High Information Density (HID) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR) pose unique challenges for biomedical experimental QA. While extracting structured knowledge, e.g., Knowledge Graphs (KGs), can substantially benefit biomedical experimental QA. Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE), a dataset that provides procedure-centric KGs of experimental entities, actions, and relations at a scale that supports reasoning over biomedical experiments across protocols. We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165 BioPIE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u8de8\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u805a\u7126\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8cQA\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa BioPIE\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff1b\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 BioPIE \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528 BioPIE \u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001HID(\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6)\u4e0e MSR(\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406)\u95ee\u7b54\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e BioPIE \u80fd\u652f\u6491\u8de8\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0cQA \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u53ca HID/MSR \u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e AI \u8f85\u52a9\u53ca\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "BioPIE \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u7f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u534f\u4f5c\u7684 QA \u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality.

Unlike prior game-theoretic MASs, whose game designs are often tightly coupled with task-specific objectives, our framework relies on linguistically informed reasoning with minimal task-specific coupling. Specifically, it treats dialogue as intentional and strategic communication, requiring agents to infer what others aim to achieve (intents) and how they pursue those goals (strategies).

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation.

Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation.

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa NeuronLLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u201c\u597d\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\u548c\u201c\u574f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u7b54\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u9762\u7684LLM\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4ee5\u5f80\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u5076\u7136\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21/\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56db\u9879NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLM\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u5355\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u6291\u5236\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ca\u56e0\u5076\u7136\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5168\u9762\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u6297\u4e3a\u539f\u7406\u7684 NeuronLLM \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u770b\u4f5c\u826f\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u7acb\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u597d\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u574f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u53e5\u96c6\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u5076\u7136\u6027\u9020\u6210\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\uff08fortuitous behaviors\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u65cf\u7fa4\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u9879NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cNeuronLLM \u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eLLM\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u65b0\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM \u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u597d\u574f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b steering \u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset.

Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images.

To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance. Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions.

While closed-source LLMs generate functional code, the resulting charts often lack semantic alignment and clarity, qualities that can only be assessed post-execution. Open-source models struggle even more, frequently producing non-executable or visually poor outputs. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve code executability, it fails to enhance overall visualization quality, as traditional SFT loss cannot capture post-execution feedback. To address this gap, we propose RL-Text2Vis, the first reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis generation. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our method uses a novel multi-objective reward that jointly optimizes textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality using post-execution feedback. By training Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B), RL-Text2Vis achieves a 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o on the Text2Vis benchmark and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% relative to its zero-shot baseline. Our models significantly outperform strong zero-shot and supervised baselines and also demonstrate robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets like VIS-Eval and NVBench. These results establish GRPO as an effective strategy for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u635f\u5931\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u7c7b\u522b\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u624d\u5206\u914d\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u4ee5\u66f4\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14 principled \u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cf\u5316\u6837\u672c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5e76\u5728\u951a\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5171\u540c\u8003\u8651\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6837\u672c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u5c06\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u539f\u5148\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u951a\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u66f4\u4e3a principled \u6574\u5408\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns, organizations often prefer on-premise deployment of LLMs. The ThaiLLM initiative aims to enhance Thai language capabilities in open-LLMs, enabling Thai industry to leverage advanced language models. However, organizations often face a trade-off between deploying multiple specialized models versus the prohibitive expense of training a single multi-capability model. To address this, we explore model merging as a resource-efficient alternative for developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs. We present results from two key experiments: first, merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B demonstrates how ThaiLLM-8B enhances Thai general capabilities, showing an uplift of M3 and M6 O-NET exams over the general instruction-following Qwen-8B. Second, we merge Qwen-8B with both ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B. This combination results in further improvements in performance across both general and financial domains, by demonstrating an uplift in both M3 and M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC benchmarks.

Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of \"hopping-too-late\" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning.

Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFENCE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u586b\u5145\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u7f3a\u5c11\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u504f\u5411\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u586b\u5145\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u540e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u8fd1\u4f3c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u6309\u8282\u70b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u6309\u7c07\u7ea7\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u503c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u51cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cFENCE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u586b\u5145\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7c07\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6/\u4e0d\u8db3\u77eb\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u586b\u5145\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks.

However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization.

Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning.

However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions.

This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs) \u6765\u7b80\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u7ebf\u6027SCM\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eEM\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u56fe\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u7ebf\u6027SCM\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5145\u8db3\u4e14\u6613\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CGL-SCMs \u5b50\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u9075\u5faa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u5b50\u7c7b\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u539f GL-SCM \u7b49\u6548\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316(EM)\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60 CGL-SCM \u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e CGL-SCMs \u5728\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\uff09\u8868\u660e\u6240\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "CGL-SCMs \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u4f46\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0cEM \u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \\textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolGate \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u5411\u6267\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u952e\u503c\u6620\u5c04\uff09\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u53d7\u4fe1\u4e16\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u524d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u540e\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u7684 Hoare \u98ce\u683c\u5951\u7ea6\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6ee1\u8db3\u524d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u679c\u624d\u4f1a\u66f4\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5199\u5165\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u53d7\u4fe1\u4e16\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002\u5c06\u5404\u5de5\u5177\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a Hoare \u98ce\u683c\u5951\u7ea6\uff08\u524d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u540e\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3002\u524d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6761\u4ef6\u6210\u7acb\uff1b\u5de5\u5177\u8fd4\u56de\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5199\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e ToolGate \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684 AI \u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations.

A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what \"uncertainty reduction\" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Tape\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u5143\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0b\u9694\u79bbOOD\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eID\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OOD\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5316OOD\u534f\u8bae\u53ca\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b/\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fa\u5b9a\u800c\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c4\u5219\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u5143\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c4\u5219\uff08 latent rules\uff09\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u65ad\uff08\u5143\u5b66\u4e60/\u5143RL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684OOD\u8bc4\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u62a5\u544a\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u79cd\u5b50\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3001\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u5c06\u71b5\u51cf\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u671f\u671b\u540e\u9a8cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0b\u201c\u51cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u201d\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u5728ID\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u6216\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684OOD\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\uff1a(i) \u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684OOD\u534f\u8bae\uff1b(ii) \u7edf\u8ba1\u62a5\u544a\u8981\u6c42\uff1b(iii) \u5c06\u71b5\u51cf\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u91cf\u5316\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u6f84\u6e05\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728 latent \u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u201c uncertainty reduction\u201d\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ca\u5e94\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06LLM\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4e24\u5c42GNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684BERT\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u7528GPT-4\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u5c42GNN\u878d\u5408LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u4f01\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u6545\u969c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece7.8\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f33.7\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cF1\u503c\u8fbe\u523094.3%\uff0c\u5e74\u5ea6\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u6210\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8bef\u5dee\u8d54\u507f\u4e0b\u964d45.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met.

Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u9636\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u671d\u66f4\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728OPT-13B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf911\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u90e8\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u57289/11\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Excess Description Length (EDL) \u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u5199\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002EDL \u5728\u671f\u671b\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u975e\u8d1f\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6781\u9650\u6536\u655b\u4e3a\u5269\u4f59\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u6f84\u6e05\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5982\u968f\u673a\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5355\u4f8b\u6837\u672c\u3001\u7a00\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u683c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u6559\u6388\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u524d\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\uff08prequential coding\uff09\u4e0b\u7684 Excess Description Length (EDL) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u91cf\u91cf\u3002EDL \u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u5f0f\u9010\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f16\u7801\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u8bc1\u660e EDL \u5728\u671f\u671b\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u975e\u8d1f\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8d8b\u5411\u65e0\u7a77\u800c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5269\u4f59\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u671f\u671b\u6cdb\u5316\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217 toy \u6a21\u578b\u9610\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bef\u533a\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u6807\u7b7e\u5bfc\u81f4 EDL \u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u3001\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u5927\u5e45\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u77ac\u6001\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1aEDL \u5728\u671f\u671b\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u975e\u8d1f\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6781\u9650\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5269\u4f59\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9\u671f\u671b\u6cdb\u5316\u589e\u76ca\u7ed9\u51fa\u754c\u9650\u3002 toy \u6a21\u578b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u76f4\u89c9\u8bef\u533a\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u683c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u521d\u671f\u77ac\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u201c\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u6559\u5b66\u201d\u5728\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5373\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027/\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ff9\u7ebf\uff1b\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u6388\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness.

This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.", "AI": {"tldr": "TimeCast is a dynamic, online prediction framework for multi-sensor streams that learns time-evolving patterns (stages) and builds stage-specific models to predict future event times, achieving higher accuracy and faster computation than baselines.", "motivation": "Real-world sensor data streams are non-stationary; patterns evolve over time; need continuous, real-time forecasting of when failures will occur.", "method": "Identify distinct time-evolving patterns (stages), train individual models per stage, leverage inter-sensor dependencies, online updates, linear scalability with input size.", "result": "Empirical results on real datasets show TimeCast outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and reduces computational time while capturing dynamic changes.", "conclusion": "Dynamic, practical, and scalable framework for real-time event-time prediction in streaming data; capable of tracking pattern shifts and updating models online."}}

This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes.

The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty.

Together, they provide an end-to-end pipeline for high-precision multimodal search by mapping diverse modalities, including text, images, document images, and video, into a unified representation space. The Qwen3-VL-Embedding model employs a multi-stage training paradigm, progressing from large-scale contrastive pre-training to reranking model distillation, to generate semantically rich high-dimensional vectors. It supports Matryoshka Representation Learning, enabling flexible embedding dimensions, and handles inputs up to 32k tokens. Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\\textbf{2B}$ and $\\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025).

To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6 CompassMem\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u5730\u56fe\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u591a\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5b58\u50a8\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6765\u652f\u6491\u957f-horizon \u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u201c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\u201d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u5173\u8054\u7b49\uff09\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\uff1b\u5728 LoCoMo \u548c NarrativeQA \u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0cCompassMem \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728 LoCoMo \u4e0e NarrativeQA \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f7f\u957f\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable.

Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \\textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \\textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO.

However, their safety vulnerabilities become pronounced in multi-turn multi-modal scenarios, where harmful intent can be gradually reconstructed across turns, and security protocols fade into oblivion as the conversation progresses. Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) alignment methods are largely developed for single-turn visual question-answer (VQA) task and often require costly manual preference annotations, limiting their effectiveness and scalability in dialogues. To address this challenge, we present InterSafe-V, an open-source multi-modal dialogue dataset containing 11,270 dialogues and 500 specially designed refusal VQA samples.

Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research.

However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity.

Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms.

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency.

While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably, on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1 score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset design and model alignment.

We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u90e8\u5206\u7f16\u7801\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5411\u91cf\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\uff08\u5f97\u5230\u201c\u5143\u4e2d\u5fc3\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u6cd5/\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u4ece\u53e5\u5b50\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u51cf\u53bb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5143\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5/\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u5c42\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6781\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4fdd\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5728DeepSeek-V3\u7b49\u6781\u5927\u578bLLM\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d6\u53e5\u5b50\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u6309\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u7ec4\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u6cd5/\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u53e5\u5b50\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u51cf\u53bb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5143\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5/\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u53e5\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u5747\u503c\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u6355\u6349\uff1b2) \u5c06\u53e5\u5b50\u5411\u91cf\u51cf\u53bb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5143\u4e2d\u5fc3\u540e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u53e5\u6cd5/\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3) \u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5728LLM\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8de8\u5c42\u5206\u5e03\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9 probing\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6210\u5206\u3002"}}

Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u500d\u4e58\u56e0\u5b50\u4ee5\u4ee3\u66ff\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5747\u8861\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e9\u9635\u5c42\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff08WD\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684 WD-\u566a\u58f0\u5e73\u8861\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570||W||\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u6570\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u88ab\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635W\u4e0a\u9644\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u500d\u4e58\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5bf9\u884c\u548c\u5217\u5206\u522b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u500d\u4e58\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u9010\u884c/\u9010\u5217\uff09\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9muP\u7684\u66f4 EXPRESS \u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5316\u3002\u4e0e Adam \u548c Muon \u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bf9 muP \u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u524d\u5411\u6781\u7b80\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f1a\u968f\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4ece Adam \u5207\u6362\u5230 Muon \u7684\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u9010\u884c/\u9010\u5217\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u8c03\u4f18\u7684 muP \u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e58\u6cd5\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5747\u8861\u8303\u6570\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u51fa\u524d\u5411\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance.

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u201c\u6709\u601d\u8003\u201d\u548c\u201c\u65e0\u601d\u8003\u201d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u5927 token \u9650\u5236\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u7684 token \u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528 SFT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6709\u601d\u8003\u89e3\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u975e\u601d\u8003\u54cd\u5e94\u7684 token \u4e0a\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cTNT \u5728 token \u8282\u7701\u7ea6 50% \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "LRMs \u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u81ea\u957f\u94fe\u8def\u601d\u8003\uff08CoT\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709 RL \u65b9\u6848\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u5956\u8d4f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700 SFT \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u601d\u8003\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT) \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528 SFT\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u8bbe\u5b9a\u975e\u601d\u8003\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6700\u5927 token \u6570\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u542b\u601d\u8003\u89e3\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u6765 informs \u975e\u601d\u8003\u56de\u7b54\u7684 token \u9650\u5236\u3002\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e DeepSeek \u548c DeepScaleR \u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "TNT \u5c06 token \u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6 50%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u601d\u8003\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u6982\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e 10%\u3002\u5728 tested \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cTNT \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "TNT \u5728\u65e0 SFT \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u601d\u8003\u8fb9\u754c\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u3002"}}

For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6297\u53ef\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u201ccherry-picking\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5f88\u96be\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u6709\u610f\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u5e94\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\uff1a\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u4ee5\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49 admissible explanation space \u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5916\u90e8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5f62\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u754c\u5b9a\u4e3a\u7531\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u5141\u8bb8\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u201ccherry-picking\u201d\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5728\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u5185\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u7b5b\u9009\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u88ab\u7b5b\u9009\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6781\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u5177\u5907\u5b8c\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c cherry-picked \u89e3\u91ca\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u975e\u88ab\u7b5b\u9009\u89e3\u91ca\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6765\u63a9\u76d6\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5f80\u5f80\u8d85\u8fc7 cherry-picking \u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u533a\u5206\u3002\u5bf9\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u540e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u91cd\u70b9\u653e\u5728\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u5357\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training.

This early discretization forces uncertainty to be resolved through token-level sampling, often leading to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics.\n  In this work, we introduce a continuous autoregressive formulation of language generation in which tokens are represented as continuous vectors that \\emph{mature} over multiple update steps before being discretized. Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.\n  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06 token \u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6210\u719f\u540e\u518d\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u4f9d\u9760\u786c\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700 token-level \u91c7\u6837\u6216\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563 token \u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u6536\u655b\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 token \u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u66f4\u65b0\u76f4\u5230\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u89e3\u7801\u5f97\u5230\u79bb\u6563 token\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u8fde\u7eed-\u79bb\u6563\u8f6c\u6362\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u53ef\u9009\u5f15\u5165\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u5e73\u6ed1\uff09\u4f46\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u7528\u6210\u719f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700 token-level \u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u6216\u989d\u5916\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u5316\u8fde\u7eed token \u8868\u793a\u76f4\u81f3\u6536\u655b\u518d\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u91c7\u6837\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed-\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise. We present a mathematical framework for computing the non-equivariance penalty exactly and efficiently in both the spatial and spectral domain. In our experiments, our method consistently outperforms prior approximate equivariance approaches in both model performance and efficiency, achieving substantial runtime gains over sample-based regularisers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u548c\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e0e\u8c31\u57df\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u5168\u7fa4\u8f68\u9053\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7fa4\uff08\u5982SO(3)\uff09\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7b97\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u51fa\u7b49\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u4e0e\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6295\u5f71\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7fa4\u7684\u5168\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u5bf9\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e0e\u8c31\u57df\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4e24\u57df\u5185\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e0e\u8c31\u57df\u5bf9\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These simplifications also limit interpretability: global explanations cannot identify which specific segments are misleading or differentiate how a detail is false (e.g., distorted vs. fabricated). To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans. Together, these tasks enable fine-grained localisation, nuanced characterisation beyond true/false and actionable explanations. Expert annotators were guided by standardised guidelines and consistency checks, leading to high inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate 15 representative LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning variants, under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Results reveal the challenging nature of fine-grained misinformation identification and analysis, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of how performance may be influenced by multiple interacting factors, including model size and reasoning capabilities, along with domain-specific textual features.

Conventional approaches frequently neglect external influences like weather, festivities, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in inefficiencies. This research investigates the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve demand prediction in retail and vending machine sectors. Four machine learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet (Fb Prophet), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to forecast inventory requirements. Ex-ternal factors like weekdays, holidays, and sales deviation indicators were methodically incorporated to enhance precision. XGBoost surpassed other models, reaching the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.7 with the inclusion of external variables.

Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems.

To address this, we introduce EvolSQL, a structure-aware data synthesis framework that evolves SQL queries from seed data into richer and more semantically diverse forms. EvolSQL starts with an exploratory Query-SQL expansion to broaden question diversity and improve schema coverage, and then applies an adaptive directional evolution strategy using six atomic transformation operators derived from the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree to progressively increase query complexity across relational, predicate, aggregation, and nesting dimensions. An execution-grounded SQL refinement module and schema-aware deduplication further ensure the creation of high-quality, structurally diverse mapping pairs.

Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time.

This limits the faithfulness of generated summaries in opinion-heavy settings. We introduce a disagreement-aware synthesis pipeline that separates belief-level aggregation from language generation. Documents are first represented as structured belief sets and aggregated using distance-based belief merging operators that explicitly model conflict. Large language models are then used only to realise the aggregated beliefs as natural language summaries.

Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \\textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters.

However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize \"lucky\" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity.

Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9 Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) \u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u9650\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8dcc\u5012\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u5728 54,209 \u6b21\u4f4f\u9662\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cCSO \u63d0\u5347 AUC-ROC \u81f3 0.91\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83 JHFRAT \u7684 0.86\uff0c\u5e76\u989d\u5916\u6bcf\u5468\u4fdd\u62a4 35 \u540d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\uff1bXGBoost \u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46 CSO \u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u52a8\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 JHFRAT \u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5df2\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff08CSO\uff09\u5bf9 JHFRAT \u7684\u6743\u91cd\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u52a0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83 CSO\u3001\u539f\u59cb JHFRAT \u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff08XGBoost\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u662f\u5426\u7eb3\u5165 EHR \u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "CSO \u7684 AUC-ROC \u4e3a 0.91\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e JHFRAT \u7684 0.86\uff1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u5468\u989d\u5916\u4fdd\u62a4 35 \u540d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\uff1bXGBoost \u8fbe 0.94\uff0c\u4f46 CSO \u5728\u98ce\u9669\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u52a8\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u533b\u9662\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u4f4f\u9662\u8dcc\u5012\u9884\u9632\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5de5\u5177\u5916\u5f62\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers.

To enable this, we present ReFInE (Relation-aware Fine-grained Interpretability & Evidence), a dataset featuring expert verified annotations that distinguish between Quotation, Compression, and Inference. Building on ReFInE, we propose GenProve, a framework that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). By optimizing a composite reward for answer fidelity and provenance correctness, GenProve significantly outperforms 14 strong LLMs in joint evaluation. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a reasoning gap where models excel at surface-level quotation but struggle significantly with inference-based provenance, suggesting that verifiable reasoning remains a frontier challenge distinct from surface-level citation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa GenProve \u6846\u67b6\u4e0e ReFInE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u51fa\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7 provenance \u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 SFT + GRPO \u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e 14 \u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927 LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u7528\u673a\u5236\u5728\u53ef\u6838\u9a8c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u5f15\u7528\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa ReFInE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684 Quotation\u3001Compression\u3001Inference \u4e09\u7c7b\u8bc1\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa GenProve \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e0e Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b54\u590d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u590d\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "GenProve \u5728\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e 14 \u79cd\u5f3a\u5927 LLM\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u5f15\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f3a\u4f46\u5728\u4ee5\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u524d\u6cbf\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6838\u9a8c\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research.

We propose that current architectures operate in a \"Metric Phase,\" where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a Holonomic Network \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c3c\u4efb\u4f55\u5b50 braiding \u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83 Transformer/RNN\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9608\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u201c\u8d28\u91cf\u7f3a\u53e3\u201d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u4e8e\u201c\u5ea6\u91cf\u9636\u6bb5\u201d\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u56e0\u679c\u5e8f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5b50 braiding\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1 Holonomic Network\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5305\u62ec\u5728 S_{10} \u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7ea6 3.6\u00d710^6 \u72b6\u6001\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4 Holonomic Network \u4e0e Transformer/RNN\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u9a8c\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c3c\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5fc5\u9700\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u660e\u786e\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\uff1aTransformer/RNN \u5448\u73b0\u65e0\u5e26\u9699\u8870\u51cf\uff0cHolonomic Network \u51fa\u73b0\u5b8f\u89c2\u201c\u8d28\u91cf\u7f3a\u53e3\u201d\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u53d8\u91cf\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5916\u5ef6\u4f38 100 \u500d\u957f\u5ea6\uff08L=50 \u2192 5000\uff09\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1bTransformer \u663e\u793a\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u5411\u4fdd\u62a4\u6765\u81ea\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c3c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u62d3\u6251\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u62a4\u53ef\u6839\u672c\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u5411\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u666e\u9002\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0e universality class\u3002"}}

The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed. To learn such representations, we introduce a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning on high-quality synthesized data with reinforcement learning to optimize long-term utility and cross-task transferability.

Standard practices typically only retain trajectories with correct final answers (positives) while ignoring the rest (negatives). We argue that this paradigm discards substantial supervision and exacerbates overfitting, limiting out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Specifically, we surprisingly find that incorporating negative trajectories into SFT yields substantial OOD generalization gains over positive-only training, as these trajectories often retain valid intermediate reasoning despite incorrect final answers. To understand this effect in depth, we systematically analyze data, training dynamics, and inference behavior, identifying 22 recurring patterns in negative chains that serve a dual role: they moderate loss descent to mitigate overfitting during training and boost policy entropy by 35.67% during inference to facilitate exploration. Motivated by these observations, we further propose Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive, sample-aware scheme that exploits such distinctive training dynamics by rescaling per-sample loss based on inter-epoch progress. Empirically, GLOW efficiently leverages unfiltered trajectories, yielding a 5.51% OOD gain over positive-only SFT on Qwen2.5-7B and boosting MMLU from 72.82% to 76.47% as an RL initialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8d1f\u9762CoT\u5e8f\u5217\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GLOW\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u63d0\u5347SFT\u7684OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0eMMLU\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u786e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u6709\u6548\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1f\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8d1f\u94fe\u4e2d\u768422\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6291\u5236\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u901f\u7387\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\uff08\u7ea6\u63d0\u9ad835.67%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faGain-based Loss Weighting(GLOW)\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u8f6e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-7B\u4e0a\uff0cGLOW\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6b63\u6837\u672cSFT\u5b9e\u73b05.51%\u7684OOD\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728MMLU\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aRL\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u4ece72.82%\u63d0\u5347\u81f376.47%\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8d1f\u94fe\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8d1fCoT\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u63d0\u5347SFT\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff0cGLOW\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u7b5b\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations.

To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion. These findings raise important questions for future research, particularly regarding when and how models should autonomously decide to realign tabular inputs, analogous to human behavior, without relying on explicit prompts or tabular data pre-processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs \u5728\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7f6e\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5e76\u906d\u9047\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u626d\u66f2\uff1b\u53ea\u6709\u501f\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u624d\u4f1a\u90e8\u5206\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u90e8\u5206\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u4e00\u8d2f\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u6709\u6548\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6-curated \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 GPT-5.2\uff09\u5728\u626d\u66f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6700\u4f4e\u670922%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u4e3b\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u683c\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u4ee5\u89c4\u8303\u8868\u793a\u5448\u73b0\u65f6\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u626d\u66f2\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\uff08TQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cdLLM\uff08\u542bSOTA\u5982GPT-5.2\uff09\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8868\u683c\u626d\u66f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aLLMs \u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u6709\u6240\u8c03\u6574\u5e76\u80fd\u7ea0\u6b63\u90e8\u5206\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u5f7b\u5e95\u3002\u626d\u66f2\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6444\u53d6\u4e0e\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002GPT-5.2 \u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u626d\u66f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u226522%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u626d\u66f2\u8868\u683c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the \"H\u00e1n D\u0101n Xu\u00e9 B\u00f9\" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a \"Functional Alignment Collapse\": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines (\"Negative Transfer\"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a \"Cargo Cult\" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SFT-based reasoning distillation causes Functional Alignment Collapse: teachers align with human cognitive difficulty, but distilled students misalign, showing negative transfer and cargo-cult-like superficial mimicry.

This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation.

However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9WSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u4fee\u6b63E(S)\u5173\u7cfb\u53caB_min\u3001B_opt\u7684\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684Critical Batch Size\u7406\u8bba\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728Warmup-Stable-Decay\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 Dynamics \u4e0d\u518d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9WSD\u63a8\u5bfc\u9002\u7528\u4e8eWSD\u7684E(S)\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5206\u6790B_min\u4e0eB_opt\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001Batch Size Scheduler\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u516c\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0WSD\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e-\u6b65\u6570\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u8c03\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "WSD\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8c03\u5ea6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

While existing work extensively addresses LLM steering for a single behavior, \\textit{compositional steering} -- i.e., steering LLMs simultaneously towards multiple behaviors -- remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose \\emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \\textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \\textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \\textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u5d4c\u5165\u6210\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5316 steering tokens\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6-shot\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728LLMs\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u5355\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u96f6-shot\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u5d4c\u5165\u4e13\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a composition token \u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5c06 steering \u7f6e\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165 token \u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u4e0e NL \u6307\u4ee4\u7b49\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u591a\u79cd LLM \u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3001LoRA \u5408\u5e76\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e14 composition token \u5bf9 unseen \u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807 LLM \u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u96f6-shot \u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4ee4\u724c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_\u03b7) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $\u03bc$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms.

Recently, there have emerged embedding methods based on generative large language models (LLMs). These methods either rely on fixed prompt templates or involve modifications to the model architecture. The former lacks further optimization of the model and results in limited performance, while the latter alters the internal computational mechanisms of the model, thereby compromising its generative capabilities. We propose SemPA, a novel approach that boosts the sentence representations while preserving the generative ability of LLMs via semantic preference alignment. We leverage sentence-level Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to efficiently optimize LLMs on a paraphrase generation task, where the model learns to discriminate semantically equivalent sentences while preserving inherent generative capacity. Theoretically, we establish a formal connection between DPO and contrastive learning under the Plackett-Luce model framework.

Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish.

Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.", "AI": {"tldr": "First Arabic tool-calling benchmark for LLMs evaluating Arabic agentic tool-use; reveals a 5-10% drop in tool-calling accuracy for Arabic prompts, highlighting linguistic fairness gaps.", "motivation": "Addresses the gap in evaluating Arabic-native LLMs in tool-use/agentic tasks, where benchmarks are English-centric; aims to enable linguistically equitable assessments and drive improvements.", "method": "Develops a standardized benchmark framework to measure functional accuracy and robustness in Arabic agentic workflows; compares tool-calling performance for Arabic vs English prompts and tool descriptions; provides evaluation metrics and protocols.", "result": "Tool-calling accuracy decreases by 5-10% when users interact in Arabic, regardless of whether tool descriptions are in Arabic or English; highlights a substantial performance gap.", "conclusion": "The benchmark is intended to spur development of more reliable Arabic-speaking AI agents and encourage further research into linguistically equitable AI evaluation; underscores need for improved datasets and models."}}

Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models.

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "FusionRoute\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u5b57/token\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9009\u53d6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8be5\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u51e0\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5c0f\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e13\u5bb6\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u5f3a\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a-token\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6570\u95e8\u9650\u7684\u76f8\u52a0\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7eaf\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e92\u8865\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u5e76\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-3\u4e0eGemma-2\u4e24\u5927\u65cf\u7cfb\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFusionRoute\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4e0eToken\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionRoute\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u7406\u8bba-\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Inside Out, a framework that utilizes a globally maintained PersonaTree as the carrier of long-term user profiling. By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency. Notably, the small MemListener model achieves memory-operation decision performance comparable to, or even surpassing, powerful reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Gemini-3-Pro.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Inside Out \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40 PersonaTree \u4f5c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u957f\u7684 trunk-branches-\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5 RL \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 MemListener \u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528 PersonaTree\uff0c\u9700\u7ec6\u8282\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1 agentic \u6a21\u5f0f\u6309\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u8f83\u5168\u6587\u672c\u62fc\u63a5\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cPersonaTree \u66f4\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b MemListener \u7684\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a DeepSeek-R1-0528\u3001Gemini-3-Pro\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u566a\u58f0\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9000\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u7684 PersonaTree \u4f5c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u753b\u50cf\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u6839 trunk \u8bbe\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f/\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d7\u63a7\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3 MemListener\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684 ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NO_OP \u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u6811\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528 PersonaTree\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u542f\u7528 agentic \u6a21\u5f0f\u7ec6\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5168\u6587\u672c\u62fc\u63a5\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cPersonaTree \u5728\u6291\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5c0f\u578b MemListener \u7684\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 DeepSeek-R1-0528\u3001Gemini-3-Pro\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6309\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7 RL \u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGlimpRouter\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u9996\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u9996\u8bcd\u71b5\u9608\u503c\u5c06\u6b65\u9aa4\u8f6c\u7ed9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5236\u7ea6\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6b65\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u2018Aha Moment\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e00\u8bcd\u71b5\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002GlimpRouter\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00token\uff1b\u82e5\u8be5token\u7684\u71b5\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5219\u5c06\u8be5\u6b65\u9aa4\u8def\u7531\u7ed9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5426\u5219\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u964d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4ee5AIME25\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea610.7%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea625.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u4e00\u77a5\u6765\u5206\u914d\u5206\u6b65\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0cGlimpRouter\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency.

To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length).

However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias.

We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark.

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ece\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u5177\u5907\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00 embodiment \u65f6\u591a\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u52a8\u540e\u679c\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4e30\u5bcc\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u884c\u52a8\u5e94\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u4f46\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6bd4\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u8fdb\u5165\u623f\u95f4\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528 embodiment \u65f6\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u591a\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3002\u8fd8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5df2\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6210\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5c06\u5df2\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63a5\u53e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u201c\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u96f6-shot \u4e0b\u964d\u201d\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u4ee5 HausaSafety \u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0cClaude 4.5 Opus \u5728\u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\u6bd4\u82f1\u8bed\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u6781\u7aef\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u96f6-shot \u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u201c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u9e3f\u6c9f\u201d\u7684\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 2\u00d74 \u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728 1440 \u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u82f1\u8bed vs \u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6 vs \u5c06\u6765\u65f6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e09\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-5.1\u3001Gemini 3 Pro\u3001Claude 4.5 Opus\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528 West African threat \u573a\u666f\u6784\u6210\u7684 HausaSafety \u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982 Yahoo-Yahoo \u9a97\u5c40\u3001 Dane \u67aa\u68b0\u5236\u9020\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e14\u60c5\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\uff1aClaude 4.5 Opus \u5728\u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\u4e2d\u6bd4\u82f1\u8bed\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0845.0% vs 36.7%\uff09\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u6001\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5e72\u6270\uff1a\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u7387\u4f4e\u81f3 15.6%\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe 57.2%\uff0c\u4e24\u7aef\u76f8\u5dee\u7ea6 9.2 \u500d\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u624e\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u5357\u90e8\u7528\u6237\u7684 Safety Pockets\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u53d8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08Invariant Alignment\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u8de8\u65f6\u6001\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}
