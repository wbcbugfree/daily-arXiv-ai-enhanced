### [1] [BioACE: An Automated Framework for Biomedical Answer and Citation Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04982)
*Deepak Gupta,Davis Bartels,Dina Demner-Fuhsman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioACE是一个自动化的框架，用于评估生物医学答案及其引文的质量，并与人类评估的相关性进行了广泛的实验和分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在生物医学领域问答中的应用日益广泛，评估生成答案的质量和引文的准确性至关重要，因为这需要专家评估来验证其与科学文献和复杂医学术语的一致性。

Method: BioACE框架从完整性、正确性、精确性和召回率等方面对答案进行评估，并开发了自动评估方法。同时，利用自然语言推断（NLI）、预训练语言模型和LLMs等方法评估引文质量。

Result: 通过详细的实验和分析，确定了生物医学答案和引文评估的最佳方法。

Conclusion: BioACE为生物医学答案和引文评估提供了一个自动化框架，并确定了有效的评估方法。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

### [2] [CoWork-X: Experience-Optimized Co-Evolution for Multi-Agent Collaboration System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05004)
*Zexin Lin,Jiachen Yu,Haoyang Zhang,Yuzhao Li,Zhonghang Li,Yujiu Yang,Junjie Wang,Xiaoqiang Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoWork-X是一个新框架，通过将协作视为跨回合的闭环优化问题来解决实时协作中的延迟和token限制问题，实现了性能的稳定提升和资源消耗的降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实时协作任务中存在延迟和token限制问题，难以实现持续的多轮适应。

Method: CoWork-X框架包含一个基于HTN技能库的Skill-Agent，用于实时执行；以及一个Co-Optimizer，用于在回合后进行技能整合，并考虑预算和漂移。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI等基准测试中，CoWork-X实现了稳定的累积性能提升，同时降低了在线延迟和token使用量。

Conclusion: CoWork-X框架有效解决了实时协作中的延迟和token限制问题，实现了性能的稳定提升和资源消耗的降低。

Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.

### [3] [Capacity Constraints and the Multilingual Penalty for Lexical Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05035)
*Sean Trott,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上表现不如单语模型，这可能源于容量限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上相对于单语模型的“多语言惩罚”，该任务需要精确的语义表示和上下文机制。

Method: 使用受控的人类相关性判断数据集（涵盖英语和西班牙语中的歧义词），比较了来自同一系列的单语和多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上的表现。然后，研究了三种潜在的容量限制：表示（嵌入各向异性降低）、注意力（对歧义线索的注意力降低）和词汇（多标记分割增加）。

Result: 多语言语言模型在词汇歧义消除任务上的表现持续低于单语模型。模型在表示、注意力和词汇限制方面均表现出一定程度的不足，并且这些因素能够统计上解释多语言模型性能下降的变异性。

Conclusion: 多语言语言模型确实存在多种容量限制，这些限制与词汇歧义消除能力的下降相关。

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

### [4] [Locas: Your Models are Principled Initializers of Locally-Supported Parametric Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05085)
*Sidi Lu,Zhenwen Liang,Dongyang Ma,Yan Wang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Locas是一种参数化内存，可以灵活地从模型参数中卸载或合并，用于持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合测试时训练与一种新型参数化内存之间的差距。

Method: 提出Locas，一种共享现代Transformer中FFN块设计的局部支持参数化内存，并讨论了两种主要变体：一种具有传统的两层MLP设计，另一种具有与SOTA LLM相同的GLU-FFN结构。

Result: Locas-GLU在PG-19和LoCoMo任务上表现出色，参数量仅增加0.02%，即可存储过去的信息，同时保持更小的上下文窗口。此外，在MMLU评估中，Locas在记忆整本书后，对模型现有内部知识的灾难性遗忘最小化。

Conclusion: Locas能够将过去的上下文永久化为参数化知识，同时最大限度地减少模型现有内部知识的灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 数据稀疏性是训练高性能语言技术和生成式人工智能模型的瓶颈。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）可以通过生成合成数据来缓解数据稀疏问题，但由于模型的“黑箱”性质，合成数据的属性难以预测。本研究提出了数据核视角空间（DKPS），为数学分析提供了基础，并为变压器模型的输出质量提供了具体的统计保证。研究推导了DKPS的数学原理，并展示了它如何为下游任务（如神经机器翻译模型或使用对比偏好优化（CPO）训练的LLMs）提供性能保证。最后，讨论了当前工作的局限性和未来的研究方向。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记训练数据的稀缺性是构建高性能语言技术和生成式人工智能模型的长期挑战。大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地用于通过生成合成数据来缓解数据稀疏问题，但由于模型的“黑箱”性质，合成数据的特性难以预测，导致工程师只能通过调整LLM的温度参数来“试探”并期望改进下游模型。因此，需要一种方法来为合成数据的质量提供数学分析和统计保证。

Method: 提出数据核视角空间（DKPS）作为一种数学框架，用于分析变压器模型的输出质量。推导DKPS的数学原理，并展示其如何提供性能保证。应用DKPS来阐明使用对比偏好优化（CPO）训练的下游任务（如神经机器翻译模型或LLMs）的性能。

Result: 推导了DKPS的数学原理，并展示了它如何提供性能保证。阐明了DKPS性能保证如何能够阐明下游任务（如神经机器翻译模型或使用对比偏好优化（CPO）训练的LLMs）的性能。

Conclusion: DKPS为分析变压器模型的输出质量提供了一个数学基础，并能为合成数据的质量提供统计保证，从而有助于解决数据稀疏问题并改进下游模型的性能。然而，当前工作存在局限性，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

### [6] [Multilingual Extraction and Recognition of Implicit Discourse Relations in Speech and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05107)
*Ahmed Ruby,Christian Hardmeier,Sara Stymne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We present a multilingual and multimodal dataset and approach for implicit discourse relation classification, integrating text and audio to improve performance, especially for low-resource languages through cross-lingual transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit discourse relation classification is challenging due to context dependency, which is not always fully captured by text alone, especially across different modalities and languages.

Method: Constructed a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish using an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs. Proposed a multimodal classification approach using Qwen2-Audio to jointly model textual and acoustic information.

Result: Text-based models performed better than audio-based models. Integrating both modalities improved performance. Cross-lingual transfer significantly benefited low-resource languages.

Conclusion: A multimodal approach integrating text and audio, combined with cross-lingual transfer, is effective for implicit discourse relation classification, particularly enhancing performance for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

### [7] [Among Us: Measuring and Mitigating Malicious Contributions in Model Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05176)
*Ziyuan Yang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当多个语言模型（LM）在去中心化的范式中进行协作时，其中一些模型可能被恶意攻击。本研究量化了恶意模型的影响，并提出了一种通过外部监管者来减轻这些影响的策略，该策略能够恢复95.31%的初始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多语言模型（LM）在协作中日益普及，恶意模型可能带来的安全风险也日益增加。

Method: 首先，我们设计了四类恶意LM，并将它们集成到四种流行的模型协作系统中，在10个数据集上评估了受损系统的性能。然后，我们提出了一种通过外部监管者来监管模型协作并禁用/屏蔽恶意模型的缓解策略。

Result: 恶意模型严重影响了多LM系统，尤其是在推理和安全领域，性能平均下降了7.12%和7.94%。我们提出的缓解策略平均恢复了95.31%的初始性能。

Conclusion: 虽然我们提出的缓解策略能显著减轻恶意模型的影响，但要使模型协作系统完全抵抗恶意模型仍然是一个有待研究的开放性问题。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将多模型协作的模式蒸馏到单个模型中，我们提高了效率并保留了协作的优势。提出的单-多模型演化循环通过模型间的交互促进了模型的集体进化和自我改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在利用多模型协作优势的同时降低成本，我们提出了将协作模式蒸馏到单个模型中的方法。

Method: 首先，我们通过训练一个单一模型来模仿多模型协作系统的输出来进行蒸馏。其次，我们提出了单-多模型演化循环，其中多个语言模型进行协作，每个模型从协作输出中进行蒸馏，然后这些蒸馏后的模型再次协作，形成一个集体进化生态系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，与初始模型相比，蒸馏后的模型在7种协作策略和15项任务上平均提高了8.0%，同时成本降低到单个模型。此外，单-多模型演化循环比现有的进化人工智能方法表现更好，平均提高了14.9%，并且能够解决初始模型难以解决的问题。

Conclusion: 我们提出的蒸馏方法和单-多模型演化循环能够有效地提高模型性能，降低推理成本，并促进模型的持续进化和自我改进。该方法具有良好的兼容性和广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

*Hsuan-Yu Chou,Wajiha Naveed,Shuyan Zhou,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开放权重语言模型（LLMs）在内容审核任务中表现出与专有LLMs相当的性能，为隐私保护的内容审核提供了新的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网的普及，有害内容的暴露增加，使得对有效内容审核的需求日益增长。研究表明，LLMs可用于社交媒体审核，但开放权重LLMs的实际能力仍有待考察。

Method: 评估了七个最先进的模型（四个专有模型和三个开放权重模型），使用了Bluesky的真实帖子、Bluesky审核服务决策以及两位作者的注释进行测试。

Result: 开放权重LLMs在敏感性（81%-97%）和特异性（91%-100%）方面与专有LLMs（72%-98%、93%-99%）相当。在检测粗鲁性方面，特异性超过敏感性；而在检测不容忍和威胁方面，敏感性超过特异性。分析还确定了人类审核员和LLMs之间的一致性。

Conclusion: 开放权重LLMs有能力在消费级硬件上支持隐私保护的内容审核，并为设计平衡社区价值观和用户偏好的审核系统提供了新的方向。

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

### [10] [Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205)
*Kenichiro Ando,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs over-cite general statements and under-cite numeric and name-based facts compared to human preferences, but their citation behavior can be calibrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) recognize cite-worthiness, control this process, and align LLM citation behavior with human preferences.

Method: Constructed a dataset to analyze the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior, categorizing web-derived texts into eight citation-motivation types and evaluating pairwise citation preferences. Used Direct Preference Optimization to calibrate LLM behavior.

Result: Humans prioritize citations for medical text. LLMs are more likely than humans to cite explicitly marked statements (e.g., on Wikipedia) but under-cite numeric sentences and sentences with personal names. Direct Preference Optimization improved alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: LLM citation behavior deviates from human preferences, particularly in under-citing numeric and name-based facts. This behavior can be adjusted using methods like Direct Preference Optimization to improve alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bagpiper是一个80亿参数的音频基础模型，通过富文本描述实现了音频的统一理解和生成，在多个音频理解和生成任务上取得了优于现有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频基础模型依赖于僵化、特定于任务的监督，并且只关注音频的孤立方面。然而，人类的智能能够整体地处理音频，将物理信号与抽象的认知概念联系起来以执行复杂任务。Bagpiper模型正是基于这种理念，旨在实现音频的整体性处理。

Method: Bagpiper模型利用丰富的文本描述（如转录、音频事件等）来解释物理音频信号。通过在包含6000亿个标记的大规模语料库上进行预训练，模型在原始音频和高级概念空间之间建立了强大的双向映射。在微调阶段，Bagpiper采用“先描述，后处理”的工作流程，模拟中间的认知推理步骤，从而在没有特定任务先验知识的情况下解决各种任务。

Result: 在音频理解方面，Bagpiper在MMAU和AIRBench基准测试中表现优于Qwen-2.5-Omni。在音频生成方面，Bagpiper在生成质量上超越了CosyVoice3和TangoFlux，能够合成语音、音乐和音效的任意组合。

Conclusion: Bagpiper是首批实现通用音频统一理解与生成的工作之一，通过富文本描述实现了对音频信号的整体性解读和生成。

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

### [12] [FedMosaic: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Parametric Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05235)
*Zhilin Liang,Yuxiang Wang,Zimu Zhou,Hainan Zhang,Boyi Liu,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Federated retrieval-augmented generation (FedRAG) enables LLMs to use distributed, private knowledge without sharing raw documents. Parametric RAG encodes knowledge into adapters, but faces challenges of high storage/communication costs and destructive aggregation. FedMosaic addresses this by clustering documents into multi-document adapters with masks and using selective aggregation, significantly outperforming SOTA in accuracy while drastically reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods often rely on centralized data, which is not suitable for privacy-sensitive domains where data is siloed. This paper introduces federated RAG (FedRAG) as a solution for collaborative knowledge utilization without sharing raw documents.

Method: The paper proposes FedMosaic, a federated RAG framework using parametric adapters. FedMosaic reduces storage and communication costs by clustering semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks. It also mitigates destructive aggregation through selective adapter aggregation, combining only relevance-aligned, non-conflicting adapters.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FedMosaic achieves an average of 10.9% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across four categories. Furthermore, it reduces storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, all while ensuring no raw documents are shared.

Conclusion: FedMosaic is the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters that effectively addresses the challenges of overhead and destructive aggregation. It significantly improves accuracy and reduces costs in privacy-aware domains without compromising data privacy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex nature of copyright law requires treating copyright infringement versus compliance as an evidence discovery process rather than a static classification task, necessitating a system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs.

It utilizes interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows for systematic auditing.

Result: The system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage in LLM outputs.

Conclusion: Copyright Detective supports the responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks, even with black-box access, through its interactive and comprehensive approach to copyright infringement analysis.

TL;DR: RoPE在LLMs的上下文扩展中至关重要。本文提出了CoPE，一种通过软裁剪RoPE的低频分量来统一OOD缓解和语义建模的方法，在长上下文（高达256k）实验中显著提升了性能，成为长度泛化的新SOTA。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) 在LLMs上下文扩展中遇到的挑战，并统一现有的两种主要方法（OOD缓解和语义建模），提出一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 通过一种极简的干预方式——CoPE，对RoPE的低频分量进行软裁剪，以消除OOD异常值，优化语义信号，并防止硬裁剪引起的频谱泄漏。

Result: 实验证明，将CoPE应用于RoPE在高达256k的上下文长度下能带来显著的性能提升，验证了理论分析，并确立了CoPE在长度泛化方面的SOTA地位。

Conclusion: CoPE通过软裁剪RoPE的低频分量，成功地统一了OOD缓解和语义建模的目标，并在长上下文长度下实现了显著的性能提升，是长度泛化的一种新方法。

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

TL;DR: RLVR在LLM和VLM中提高了推理能力，但响应长度变化模式因算法而异。本文分析了RLVR算法的组成部分，提出了长度无偏序列策略优化（LUSPO）算法，解决了响应长度缩短问题，并在数学和多模态推理基准测试中取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期的强化学习（RL）结合可验证奖励（RLVR）在大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）上的应用，显著提升了复杂任务的推理能力。然而，RLVR训练中响应长度的增加通常被视为推理能力增长的关键因素，但不同RLVR算法在训练过程中响应长度的变化模式差异显著。本文旨在从根本上解释这些变化。

Method: 本文对主流RLVR算法的组成部分进行了深入分析，提出了影响响应长度的理论分析，并通过大量实验进行了验证。基于理论发现，提出了长度无偏序列策略优化（LUSPO）算法，该算法纠正了群组序列策略优化（GSPO）中固有的长度偏见，使其损失函数在响应长度上无偏，解决了响应长度缩短的问题。

Result: 通过在数学推理基准和多模态推理场景中的大量实验，LUSPO算法持续获得优于现有方法（如GRPO和GSPO）的性能。

Conclusion: LUSPO算法是一种新颖的、最先进的优化策略，优于现有方法，并在数学推理和多模态推理方面取得了优异的成果。

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: LLMs增强了MAS的能力，但缺乏系统性优化框架，主要由于归因模糊（缺乏因素分类和统一指标）。本文提出设计科学方法，引入协作增益指标（Γ）以区分真实协作收益和资源增加，并建立因素归因范式和MAS因素库，以指导从盲目实验到严谨科学的转变，推动集体智能科学的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统（MAS）研究过度依赖经验试错，缺乏系统性优化和改进的科学框架，主要瓶颈在于归因模糊：缺乏结构化的因素分类和统一的评估指标，无法区分真实的协作增益和简单的资源累积。

Method: 提出采用设计科学方法，建立一个综合框架，引入协作增益指标（Γ）作为科学标准，以分离纯粹的协作收益和预算增加带来的收益。利用Γ指标，提出一个因素归因范式，系统地识别驱动协作的因素。构建了一个系统的MAS因素库，将设计空间划分为控制层预设和信息层动态。

Result: 通过引入协作增益指标（Γ）和因素归因范式，以及MAS因素库，为MAS研究提供了一个从盲目实验转向严谨科学的框架，能够系统性地识别协作驱动因素，并区分真实的协作增益。

Conclusion: 本文提出的设计科学框架，通过引入协作增益指标（Γ）和因素归因范式，解决了MAS研究中归因模糊的问题，为从经验试错走向系统化、科学化的MAS研究（即集体智能科学）铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRM）的推理成本高且会产生冗余推理，而小型语言模型（SLM）效率高但难以进行多步推理。本研究提出了一种名为MentorCollab的推理时协作方法，其中LRM选择性地、稀疏地指导SLM，而不是完全接管生成。通过在随机抽样的词元位置探测模型间的分歧，并使用轻量级验证器决定SLM是应遵循其导师提供的简短前瞻性片段还是自行继续。在15个SLM-LRM对和3个领域（数学推理、常识推理和常识推理）的实验中，MentorCollab在12种情况下提高了性能，平均提升3.0%，最高提升8.0%，同时平均仅采用18.4%的词元由昂贵的导师模型生成。研究表明，简短的片段和选择性探测足以实现有效的协作。该方法在不增加大量推理开销的情况下，恢复了大型模型的推理能力。

Motivation: 现有的LLM与SLM协作方法会促进模仿，导致推理冗长且错误纠正效果不佳。本研究旨在提出一种能够恢复大型模型推理能力且不会产生高昂推理成本的协作方法。

Method: 提出MentorCollab，一种推理时协作方法。LRM选择性地、稀疏地指导SLM，在随机抽样的词元位置探测模型间的分歧，并使用轻量级验证器决定SLM是应遵循LRM提供的简短前瞻性片段还是自行继续。

Conclusion: 选择性地在推理时进行指导（简短片段和选择性探测）足以实现有效的协作，并且可以在不增加大量推理开销的情况下恢复大型模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

TL;DR: 语言模型能够隐式地编码字符级信息，尽管训练时未明确提供。我们通过分析在受控设置下训练的模型来揭示其机制，并确定了与分词相关的因素（如合并规则和拼写约束）以及与分词无关的因素（如子字符串的语义关联和句法信息）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在未明确提供字符级信息的情况下，如何隐式地学习和编码字符级信息的机制。

Method: 通过比较在标准设置和受控设置（指定预训练数据集或分词器）下训练的语言模型，分析模型获取字符级知识的过程，并将影响因素分为与分词相关的和无关的两类。

Result: 分词相关的因素包括合并规则和拼写约束；与分词无关的因素包括子字符串的语义关联和句法信息。

Conclusion: 合并规则、拼写约束、子字符串的语义关联和句法信息是语言模型隐式学习字符级知识的关键因素。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

TL;DR: 迭代直接偏好优化（DPO）在推理任务上是大型语言模型的对齐的最新范式。然而，标准的 DPO-R1 实现依赖于 N 选一采样（N>=8）来挖掘“黄金轨迹”，我们发现这在数学推理中收益递减且可能导致灾难性策略崩溃。我们引入了 PACE（Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration），一种基于生成和纠正的策略，使用极小的预算（2<N<3）即可合成高保真偏好对。 PACE 的效果优于 DPO-R1（N=16），计算量仅为后者的五分之一，并且对奖励漏洞和标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 标准的迭代直接偏好优化（DPO）实现依赖于 N 选一采样来挖掘“黄金轨迹”，我们挑战了这种扩展假设，并发现它在数学推理中会带来收益递减甚至灾难性的策略崩溃。我们旨在提出一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们理论上证明了增加 N 会放大验证器噪声并引起有害的分布偏移。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了 PACE（Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration），它用一种基于生成的纠正策略取代了蛮力挖掘。PACE 使用极小的预算（2<N<3），可以从失败的探索中合成高保真的偏好对。

Result:  PACE 的实验评估表明，它在性能上优于 DPO-R1（N=16），而计算量仅为后者的五分之一。此外，PACE 在抵抗奖励漏洞和标签噪声方面表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PACE 是一种有效的替代方法，可以取代标准的 N 选一采样方法，用于在数学推理任务中对齐大型语言模型。它在提高效率和鲁棒性方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在医疗领域的应用受限于其英语中心化，导致在低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）上表现不佳，这在阿拉伯语和英语的医疗问答对比分析中得到证实，问题根源在于分词问题和模型置信度与正确率的脱节，需要语言感知的模型设计和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗领域的应用虽广泛，但普遍存在英语中心化的问题，这在语言多样性社群中限制了其稳健性和可靠性。已有研究指出模型在低资源语言的医疗任务中表现存在差异，但其根本原因尚不明确。

Method: 本研究对LLM在阿拉伯语和英语的医疗问答任务上进行了跨语言实证分析。

Result: 研究发现，语言差异导致的性能差距会随着任务复杂度的增加而加剧。分词分析揭示了阿拉伯语医疗文本存在结构性碎片化问题。可靠性分析表明，模型报告的置信度和解释与其正确性之间相关性有限。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在医疗任务中，LLM的设计和评估策略需要具备语言意识。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型领域存在的局限性，如幻觉、信息过时和可解释性差，以及文本检索增强生成（RAG）在多跳推理方面的不足，同时克服知识图谱（KGs）需要查询语言知识的障碍。

Method: 提出一个交互式框架，允许LLMs生成并解释Cypher图查询，用户通过自然语言与LLM互动，迭代地优化查询。该框架在真实的KGs上进行了应用。

Result: 该框架提高了对复杂数据集的可访问性，同时保持了事实准确性和语义严谨性。通过在合成电影KG上的90个查询基准测试，以及在Hyena KG和MaRDI KG上的两个小型实际查询生成实验，评估了查询解释质量和故障检测能力，并分析了模型在不同领域的性能变化。

Conclusion: 该交互式框架有效解决了LLMs在知识密集型领域应用的挑战，通过结合LLMs的语言能力和KGs的结构化知识，实现了更准确、可解释和易于访问的数据查询。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

TL;DR: IESR是一个用于文本到SQL的框架，它利用大型语言模型进行信息理解和模式链接，并通过多路径推理和轨迹一致性验证来提高准确性。该框架在LogicCat和Archer数据集上取得了最先进的性能，同时使用了轻量级模型且无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL方法在处理复杂推理、领域知识和假设性查询时存在困难，并且部署成本高昂。因此，需要一个轻量级的解决方案来解决这些问题。

Method: IESR框架整合了以下技术：1. 利用大型语言模型进行关键信息理解和模式链接，并将数学计算与SQL生成分离开。2. 集成了基于蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和多数投票的多路径推理机制。3. 引入了具有判别器模型的轨迹一致性验证模块，以确保准确性和一致性。

Result: IESR在LogicCat（24.28 EX）和Archer（37.28 EX）数据集上取得了最先进的性能，并且使用了轻量级模型而无需微调。此外，研究还发现当前的编码器模型在物理知识、数学计算和常识推理方面存在明显的偏见和缺陷。

Conclusion: IESR框架能够有效地解决文本到SQL任务中的复杂推理、领域知识和假设性查询等挑战，并能以轻量级模型实现最先进的性能。同时，该研究揭示了当前编码器模型在特定推理能力上的不足，为未来的研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

TL;DR: 现有的儿童对话话语质量评估指标（如MLU、词汇多样性、可读性指数）主要关注话语长度，忽视了对话语境，因此无法有效评估儿童回应的推理深度、话题维持和话语规划等质量方面。本文提出了一种“LLM-as-a-judge”框架，首先对成人前置话语类型进行分类，然后从“扩展性”（上下文阐述和推理深度）和“独立性”（儿童对推进对话的贡献）两个维度对儿童的回应进行评分。这两个维度反映了儿童语言发展的重要方面，“扩展性”涵盖阐述、从句组合、因果和对比连接词的使用；“独立性”则捕捉了主动性、话题控制、通过日益增长的自我调节减少对成人脚手架的依赖以及听众设计。通过展示与年龄相关的模式以及在年龄估计方面的预测价值，本文确立了发展效度，并证实了与话语关系相关的语义敏感性。这些指标与人类判断一致，可实现大规模评估，将儿童话语评估从单纯的长度测量转变为在特定语境中评估儿童语言对对话的有意义贡献和推进作用。

Conclusion: 该框架将儿童话语评估从单纯的长度测量转变为在特定语境中评估儿童语言对对话的有意义贡献和推进作用。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的预训练大型语言模型（LLM）计算成本高昂，阻碍了快速发展。该研究旨在探索是否可以利用现有的、较小的预训练模型来加速更大模型的训练。

Method: 提出了一种晚期到早期训练（LET）范式，该范式利用预训练模型的晚期层表征来指导早期层在早期训练步骤中的学习。它包含两个关键机制：晚期到早期步骤学习和晚期到早期层学习。

Result: LET范式在1.4B和7B参数模型上进行了广泛实验。在Pile数据集上训练1.4B LLM时，与标准训练相比，LET实现了高达1.6倍的加速，下游任务准确率提高了近5%，即使使用的预训练模型参数量是目标模型的1/10。

Conclusion: LET范式能够显著加速训练收敛，同时稳健地提高语言建模能力和下游任务性能，从而以更快的速度实现更优越的性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的基于参照的语法纠错（GEC）自动评估指标（如BERTScore）在衡量假设和参照句子的相似性时效果不佳，因为许多源句中的单词在假设和参照中都保持不变。本研究提出了ERRANT（Edit RElative sTandardizer），一个专注于GEC编辑的度量标准。通过引入“编辑向量”的概念来表示编辑，并利用非最优传输（UOT）将假设中的编辑向量传输到参照中，从而提出了新的评估指标UOT-ERRANT。实验表明，UOT-ERRANT在SEEDA元评估中提高了评估性能，特别是在编辑较多的+Fluency领域。此外，该方法具有高度可解释性，因为传输计划可以被视为一种软编辑对齐，使得UOT-ERRANT成为GEC系统排名和分析的有用指标。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估对于选择最佳的语法纠错（GEC）系统至关重要。然而，目前流行的基于相似度的指标（如BERTScore）在GEC评估中效果不佳，因为它们无法有效捕捉GEC任务特有的编辑信息。

Method: 提出了一种名为“编辑向量”的表示方法来量化GEC编辑。在此基础上，引入了一种名为UOT-ERRANT的新型评估指标，该指标使用非最优传输（unbalanced optimal transport）算法将假设句子中的编辑向量与参照句子中的编辑向量进行匹配和比对。

Result: 在SEEDA元评估实验中，UOT-ERRANT评估指标在评估性能上有所提升，尤其是在+Fluency领域，该领域包含大量GEC编辑。此外，该方法通过其传输计划提供了高度的可解释性，可以视为一种软编辑对齐。

Conclusion: UOT-ERRANT通过利用GEC编辑的结构信息并结合非最优传输，能够更有效地评估GEC系统。其可解释性使其成为分析和排名GEC系统的有力工具。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems.

TL;DR: 现有的视觉-语言模型（VLMs）基准测试未能充分评估模型在文化上合理但视觉上不准确的解释能力，尤其是在非西方背景和非英语语境中。本研究提出了 M2CQA，一个包含来自 17 个中东北非（MENA）国家的图像的多模态基准测试，并配有英语、阿拉伯语及其方言的对比性真实陈述和反事实陈述。为了区分幻觉和原始准确性，研究引入了反事实幻觉率（CFHR），用于衡量在正确回答真实陈述的前提下接受反事实陈述的程度。对最先进的 VLMs 进行评估后发现，在阿拉伯语，特别是方言中，CFHR 显著升高，即使在真实陈述准确率保持不变的情况下也是如此。此外，“先推理”的提示策略会增加反事实幻觉，“先回答后解释”的策略则能提高鲁棒性。

Motivation: 评估视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在接受文化上合理但视觉上不准确的解释方面的能力，并特别关注非西方背景（特别是中东北非地区）和多种语言（包括阿拉伯语及其方言）。

Method: 构建了一个名为 M2CQA 的多模态基准测试，包含来自 17 个中东北非国家/地区的图像，并配有英语、阿拉伯语及其方言的真实和反事实陈述。提出了反事实幻觉率（CFHR）指标来衡量模型在正确回答真实陈述的前提下接受反事实陈述的能力。评估了多种提示策略对 VLM 幻觉行为的影响。

Result: 在 M2CQA 基准测试上，评估的 VLMs 在阿拉伯语（尤其是方言）上表现出更高的反事实幻觉率（CFHR），即使在真实陈述的准确率很高的情况下也是如此。研究发现，“先推理”的提示策略会增加反事实幻觉，而“先回答后解释”的策略可以提高模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型在处理非西方文化和语言（特别是阿拉伯语及其方言）时，更容易出现幻觉现象。模型的幻觉行为对提示策略非常敏感，需要进一步研究以提高其在多文化和多语言环境下的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

TL;DR: 因果视角下的安全对齐机制被建模为一个未观测的混淆因子，提出CFA^2（因果前门调整攻击）框架，利用SAE剥离防御特征，通过确定性干预实现有效的越狱，并提供越狱过程的机制解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全对齐机制在大型语言模型（LLMs）中通常作为潜在的内部状态，模糊了模型固有的能力。

Method: 将安全对齐机制作为因果视角下的未观测混淆因子，提出CFA^2（因果前门调整攻击）框架，利用SAE（稀疏自编码器）剥离防御特征，将计算上昂贵的边际化减少为具有低推理复杂度的确定性干预。

Result: CFA^2在越狱方面取得了最先进的攻击成功率，并对越狱过程进行了机制解释。

Conclusion: CFA^2框架能够有效地绕过LLMs的安全对齐机制，实现鲁棒的越狱，并为理解越狱过程提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为“Reasoning under Ambiguity”的框架，用于解决多语言多标签情感分类中的情感歧义和不完全监督问题。该框架通过共享多语言编码器、特定语言优化以及基于熵的歧义加权机制来处理不确定性，并将不完整标签视为不确定性而非负面证据。此外，还引入了掩码感知目标和正例-无标签正则化以增强在部分监督下的鲁棒性。实验结果表明，该方法在英语、西班牙语和阿拉伯语情感分类任务上均优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识库系统在进行多语言情感识别时面临情感歧义和监督不完全的挑战。现有的多标签情感分类方法通常假设标签是完全已知的，并依赖确定性学习目标，这在部分监督下会导致有偏的学习和不可靠的预测。

Method: 提出了一种名为“Reasoning under Ambiguity”的不确定性感知框架。该框架使用共享多语言编码器，并结合特定语言的优化。引入了基于熵的歧义加权机制，该机制会降低高度模糊的训练实例的权重，而不是将缺失的标签视为负面证据。此外，还结合了掩码感知目标和正例-无标签（PU）正则化，以在部分监督下实现鲁棒学习。

Result: 在英语、西班牙语和阿拉伯语情感分类基准测试中，与强大的基线方法相比，在多个评估指标上均取得了持续的改进。此外，还提高了训练稳定性，增强了对注释稀疏性的鲁棒性，并提升了解释性。

Conclusion: 所提出的“Reasoning under Ambiguity”框架能够有效地处理多语言多标签情感分类中的不确定性问题，并在不完整监督的情况下实现鲁棒和可解释的情感识别。

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: To transfer knowledge from large, high-resource LLMs to smaller, low-resource targets, a cross-architecture merging framework using optimal transport (OT) is proposed. This framework aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models and uses transport plans to guide weight-space fusion, enabling effective knowledge transfer with minimal input data. Experiments show consistent improvements in low-resource languages and specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most real-world deployments use smaller models trained on low-resource data, creating a gap with large language models (LLMs) that have strong capabilities due to scaling. This necessitates mechanisms for transferring knowledge from high-resource LLMs to low-resource targets, as existing model merging approaches require architecture compatibility, which is often not the case.

Method: A cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) is proposed. This framework aligns activations between heterogeneous models to infer cross-neuron correspondences. These correspondences, captured in transport plans, then guide a direct weight-space fusion process. This allows knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource models using only a small set of input data.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrated consistent improvements when using the proposed framework compared to the original target models.

Conclusion: The proposed optimal transport-based cross-architecture merging framework effectively transfers knowledge from high-resource to low-resource models, even when architectures are heterogeneous. This approach yields significant improvements in low-resource settings and specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-based post-training with GRPO can lead to imbalanced performance across multiple tasks. MT-GRPO is proposed to address this by dynamically adapting task weights to optimize worst-task performance and using a ratio-preserving sampler for balanced gradients. Experiments show MT-GRPO outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy and achieves better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of large language models requires reliable performance across diverse tasks, but standard multi-task GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes where some tasks dominate optimization while others stagnate. Additionally, variations in prompt-generated gradients across tasks distort their effective contribution to optimization.

Method: The paper proposes a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm. MT-GRPO features (i) dynamic adaptation of task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress, and (ii) a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients align with the adapted weights.

Result: Experiments in 3-task and 9-task settings demonstrate that MT-GRPO consistently surpasses baseline methods in worst-task accuracy. Specifically, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% absolute improvement on worst-task performance compared to standard GRPO and 6% over DAPO, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Furthermore, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, indicating enhanced efficiency in achieving reliable cross-task performance.

Conclusion: MT-GRPO effectively addresses the challenge of imbalanced performance in multi-task learning for large language models by optimizing worst-task performance and ensuring balanced progress and gradient contributions, leading to improved reliability and efficiency across diverse tasks.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

TL;DR: LLMs在个性化教育中存在“一刀切”的风险，本研究提出了CASTLE基准来评估针对不同学生的安全风险，实验表明现有LLMs在此方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的同质化响应忽视了学生在认知和心理上的异质性，可能对弱势学生群体构成安全风险。现有的安全评估指标（如事实准确性、偏见、毒性）无法捕捉同一响应对不同学生属性可能造成的不同危害。

Method: 提出“学生定制化个性安全”（Student-Tailored Personalized Safety）概念，并基于教育理论构建了CASTLE基准。该基准包含15种教育安全风险和14种学生属性，涵盖92,908个双语场景。设计了三种评估指标：风险敏感性（Risk Sensitivity）、情感共情（Emotional Empathy）和学生匹配度（Student Alignment）。

Result: 在18个SOTA LLMs上的实验显示，所有模型在CASTLE基准上的平均安全评分为2.3/5，表明在个性化安全保障方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs在满足学生个性化安全需求方面存在巨大差距，需要进一步研究和改进以确保教育场景下的模型安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

TL;DR: Transformer模型在处理土耳其语和现代希伯来语的复杂动词范式时，其表示能力受分词策略影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型如何表示土耳其语和现代希伯来语的复杂动词范式，重点关注分词策略如何影响这种能力。

Method: 在自然数据上使用Blackbird Language Matrices任务。

Result: 对于土耳其语（形态标记透明），无论分词是原子的还是将词语分解为小的子词单元，单语和多语模型都能成功。对于希伯来语，单语和多语模型表现不同，字符级分词的多语模型未能捕捉非连接形态，而具有词素感知的单语模型表现良好。所有模型在更具合成性的数据集上表现均有提高。

Conclusion: 分词策略对Transformer模型表示复杂动词范式至关重要，尤其是在处理像希伯来语这样具有非连接形态的语言时。词素感知的或原子的分词对性能至关重要。

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

Result: 评估结果显示，在临床文本错误检测、定位和纠正任务上，不同语言模型的性能存在显著差距，尤其是在非英语环境中。这凸显了开发符合临床需求且具备语言意识的系统的必要性。

Conclusion: MedErrBench的提出填补了多语言临床NLP基准的空白，并强调了在非英语环境中开发更优良的临床AI系统的迫切需求。通过公开MedErrBench及其评估规程，研究旨在推动多语言临床NLP的发展，以促进全球范围内更安全、更公平的AI医疗保健服务。

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally. The dataset is available in the supplementary material. An anonymized version of the dataset is available at: https://github.com/congboma/MedErrBench.

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: OmniMoE通过引入原子专家和一种新的路由及调度机制，实现了极细粒度的混合专家模型，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家（MoE）模型在专家粒度和硬件执行效率之间存在权衡，本文旨在打破这一限制，实现更细粒度的专家划分以提高参数效率。

Method: 提出OmniMoE框架，该框架结合了系统和算法的协同设计。关键创新包括：1. 引入向量级原子专家（Atomic Experts），将专家粒度推向极致。2. 设计了一个笛卡尔积路由器（Cartesian Product Router），将路由复杂度从O(N)降低到O(sqrt(N))。3. 采用以专家为中心的调度（Expert-Centric Scheduling），优化内存访问模式，将分散的查找转化为密集的矩阵运算。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，OmniMoE（拥有17亿激活参数）在零样本准确率上达到了50.9%，优于DeepSeekMoE和PEER等基线模型。与PEER相比，OmniMoE的推理延迟从73毫秒降低到6.7毫秒，加速了10.9倍。

Conclusion: OmniMoE证明了大规模细粒度MoE模型可以兼具高精度和高推理速度，通过系统-算法协同设计克服了细粒度带来的挑战。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

TL;DR: CompactRAG通过离线重构知识库和在线解耦推理来优化多跳RAG，显著减少了LLM调用和token消耗，同时保持了有竞争力的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多跳RAG系统在每次迭代中都会在检索和推理之间交替进行，导致LLM调用次数过多、token消耗量大以及实体连接不稳定。

Method: CompactRAG将知识库的重构与推理分离开。在离线阶段，LLM将语料库转换为原子化的问答知识库。在在线阶段，将复杂查询分解并重写，然后通过密集检索和基于RoBERTa的答案提取来解决，LLM在推理过程中仅调用两次。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MuSiQue数据集上，CompactRAG实现了具有竞争力的准确性，并显著降低了token消耗。

Conclusion: CompactRAG是一种成本效益高且实用的方法，可用于大规模知识库的多跳推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

### [37] [LongR: Unleashing Long-Context Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Dense Utility Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05758)
*Bowen Ping,Zijun Chen,Yiyao Yu,Tingfeng Hui,Junchi Yan,Baobao Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for LLM reasoning, especially in long-context tasks. Existing methods using sparse rewards have limitations. LongR introduces a 'Think-and-Read' mechanism and a contextual density reward to improve long-context performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLM reasoning in long-context scenarios are limited by sparse, outcome-only rewards, which are insufficient for guiding complex deduction.

Method: LongR integrates a dynamic 'Think-and-Read' mechanism (interleaving reasoning with document consultation) and a contextual density reward (based on relative information gain) to enhance long-context performance.

Result: LongR achieved a 9% gain on LongBench v2, showed consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, and demonstrated robust efficiency. It also enhanced performance across various RL algorithms like DAPO and GSPO. Analyses showed the impact of reasoning chain length and robustness against distractors.

Conclusion: LongR effectively enhances long-context performance in LLMs by combining a 'Think-and-Read' mechanism with a contextual density reward, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT 等大型语言模型（LLM）的普及引发了对其在学术界被滥用的担忧，因为难以区分人类写作和生成文本。现有研究表明，自动化检测技术在一定程度上是有效的，但这些方法常常因低困惑度（LLM 的一个关键特征）而错误地将非母语者的论文标记为生成文本。本文在两年后，特别针对捷克语环境，重新审视了这些说法。研究表明，捷克语非母语者的文本困惑度并不低于母语者。此外，对三种不同类型的检测器进行了检验，未发现对非母语者存在系统性偏见。最后，证明了当代的检测器在不依赖困惑度的情况下仍然有效。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，自动化检测技术常常因低困惑度而错误地将非母语者的论文标记为生成文本，但本文旨在重新审视这些说法，特别是在捷克语环境中。

Method: 检验捷克语非母语者和母语者的文本困惑度差异，并检验三种不同类型的检测器是否存在对非母语者的系统性偏见，最后验证当代检测器是否能不依赖困惑度进行有效检测。

Result: 捷克语非母语者的文本困惑度并不低于母语者。对三种不同类型的检测器进行检验，未发现对非母语者存在系统性偏见。当代检测器在不依赖困惑度的情况下仍然有效。

Conclusion: 与先前研究的说法相反，在捷克语环境中，LLM 检测器并未表现出对非母语者的系统性偏见，并且不依赖困惑度仍能有效运作。

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

TL;DR: 该研究引入了OdysseyArena，一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在需要自主发现环境规则（归纳学习）而非仅遵循给定规则（演绎学习）的长期互动任务中的表现的基准测试。现有评估大多采用演绎范式，而忽略了LLMs自主学习环境潜在规律的能力。OdysseyArena包含4个核心环境和120个标准化基准任务（OdysseyArena-Lite），用于衡量模型的归纳效率和长期探索能力。此外，还引入了OdysseyArena-Challenge用于测试模型在极长互动过程中的稳定性。实验结果表明，即使是最先进的LLMs在归纳场景下也表现出不足，突显了在复杂环境中实现自主发现的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型（LLMs）智能体的评估主要集中在演绎式任务，即智能体遵循明确规则和静态目标，且规划视野有限。这种评估方式忽略了智能体从经验中自主发现潜在转换规律的能力，而这对于实现智能体的远见卓识和维持战略连贯性至关重要。因此，有必要开发一种新的评估框架，以解决智能体在长期、主动和归纳式互动中的学习能力。

Method: 该研究提出了OdysseyArena，一个用于评估智能体在长期、主动和归纳式互动中表现的框架。该框架通过形式化和实例化四个基本组成部分，将抽象的转换动力学转化为具体的交互环境。在此基础上，研究者构建了OdysseyArena-Lite，一个包含120个任务的标准基准测试，用于衡量智能体的归纳效率和长期发现能力。此外，他们还提出了OdysseyArena-Challenge，用于在极长的互动视野（超过200步）下测试智能体的稳定性。

Result: 在对15个以上的主流LLMs进行的广泛实验中，研究发现即使是最前沿的模型在归纳场景下也存在明显的不足。这表明在追求复杂环境中自主发现能力方面，存在一个关键的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 现有的LLMs在需要自主发现环境规则的长期互动任务中表现不佳，这揭示了在复杂环境中实现自主学习和发现能力的重大挑战。OdysseyArena提供了一个新的评估平台，用于识别和解决这些不足。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

TL;DR: RRAttention通过一种新颖的头轮循（RR）采样策略，实现了一种动态稀疏注意力方法，该方法将复杂度从O(L^2)降低到O(L^2/S^2)，同时保持查询独立性并实现全局模式发现。它在自然语言理解和视频理解任务上取得了与全注意力相似的性能，但计算量减少了一半，实现了2.4倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二次方复杂度的注意力机制是处理长上下文的大型语言模型的关键瓶颈。现有的动态稀疏注意力方法在效率和基本属性之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出了一种名为RRAttention的新型动态稀疏注意力方法，采用头轮循（RR）采样策略，通过在每个步长内跨注意力头轮换查询采样位置，来保持查询独立性并实现高效的全局模式发现。结合自适应Top-τ稀疏选择。

Result: RRAttention将复杂度从O(L^2)降低到O(L^2/S^2)，在自然语言理解（HELMET）和视频理解（Video-MME）任务上，恢复了超过99%的全注意力性能，计算量减少了一半，在128K上下文长度下实现了2.4倍的加速。

Conclusion: RRAttention是一种有效的动态稀疏注意力方法，它通过新颖的轮循采样策略，解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著提高了效率。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

### [41] [xList-Hate: A Checklist-Based Framework for Interpretable and Generalizable Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05874)
*Adrián Girón,Pablo Miralles,Javier Huertas-Tato,Sergio D'Antonio,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hate speech detection is often oversimplified as binary classification, leading to models that overfit specific datasets. This paper proposes xList-Hate, a framework that breaks down hate speech detection into a series of explicit questions answered by an LLM, with the results aggregated by a decision tree for transparent predictions. xList-Hate improves robustness across different datasets and provides fine-grained interpretability, suggesting that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task is a more effective approach for content moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hate speech detection models overfit to dataset-specific definitions due to the complex, multi-faceted nature of hate speech, leading to poor robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.

Method: The paper introduces xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions. An LLM answers each question independently, generating a binary diagnostic representation. These signals are then aggregated by an interpretable decision tree for final predictions.

Result: The xList-Hate framework demonstrates improved cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift compared to zero-shot LLM classification and supervised fine-tuning. Qualitative analysis shows it is less sensitive to annotation inconsistencies and contextual ambiguity, offering fine-grained interpretability.

Conclusion: Reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, offers a more robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

TL;DR: 小型推理模型（SRM）在资源受限环境下进行链式思考（CoT）推理至关重要，但它们容易出现忠实性幻觉。现有方法依赖于基于结果的奖励或粗粒度的CoT评估，这可能在最终答案正确时无意中强化不忠实的推理。为此，我们提出了忠实性感知步级强化学习（FaithRL），它通过显式的忠实性奖励和隐式的截断重采样策略引入步级监督，以解决这些限制。实验表明，FaithRL在多个SRM和开放域问答基准测试中，能够持续减少CoT和最终答案中的幻觉，从而实现更忠实可靠的推理。

Motivation: 现有用于减轻小型推理模型（SRM）在链式思考（CoT）推理中幻觉的方法，主要依赖于基于最终结果的奖励或粗粒度的CoT评估，这可能在最终答案正确的情况下无意中强化了不忠实的推理过程。因此，需要一种能够提供更精细化监督的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出忠实性感知步级强化学习（FaithRL），该方法通过引入步级显式忠实性奖励（来自过程奖励模型）和隐式截断重采样策略（从忠实的前缀生成对比信号）来实现步级监督，以解决现有方法在处理SRM幻觉问题上的局限性。

Result: 在多个SRM和开放域问答基准测试上的实验表明，FaithRL能够一致地减少CoT和最终答案中的幻觉，从而提高了推理的忠实性和可靠性。

Conclusion: FaithRL通过引入步级忠实性奖励和截断重采样策略，能够有效地减少小型推理模型中的幻觉，提高推理的忠实度和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的kv-cache压缩方法忽略了kv-cache的数据相关性和层间差异性，导致在处理长上下文时GPU内存带宽受限。

Method: KV-CoRE利用SVD计算Frobenius范数下的最优低秩近似，并采用梯度无关和增量式的方法进行数据集级别和层级评估。使用归一化有效秩作为可压缩性度量。

Result: 分析了多种模型和数据集，揭示了可压缩性与模型架构、训练数据和语言覆盖范围之间的系统性关联。发现归一化有效秩与压缩性能下降显著相关。

Conclusion: KV-CoRE提供了一个原则性的评估框架和大规模的LLM kv-cache可压缩性基准，为动态、数据感知压缩和以数据为中心模型开发提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

TL;DR: While larger instruction-tuned models show more consistency in value-laden MCQ responses across languages, they still exhibit language-specific behavior on certain questions, suggesting that the preference fine-tuning has a selective effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multilingual LLMs respond consistently to value-laden MCQs across languages or exhibit language-induced variations.

Method: Released a new corpus (MEVS) of human-translated survey questions in 8 European languages. Administered a subset of these questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs under controlled prompt variations.

Result: Larger, instruction-tuned models displayed higher overall consistency, but response robustness varied greatly across questions. Language-specific behavior emerged in consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models on certain questions.

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs do not behave like theoretical polyglots for value-laden MCQs; language-specific behavior arises in consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models on certain questions, indicating a selective effect of preference fine-tuning that warrants further study.

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

TL;DR: TRIT框架通过集成翻译训练来提升多语言长文本推理能力，在MMATH数据集上表现优于基线模型7个百分点，同时提高了答案正确性和语言一致性，并改善了跨语言问题对齐和翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本推理模型在多语言环境下表现不佳，主要体现在两个方面：1. 对于非英语问题，模型倾向于使用英语进行推理；2. 当强制模型使用问题所在语言进行推理时，准确率会显著下降。这表明模型在多语言问题理解和多语言推理能力上均存在不足。

Method: 提出TRIT（Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training）框架，一个能够自我改进的框架，旨在通过联合训练翻译和多语言推理任务，来同时提升多语言问题理解和响应生成能力，且无需外部反馈或额外多语言数据。

Result: TRIT框架在MMATH数据集上超越多个基线模型平均7个百分点，提升了答案的正确性和语言一致性。此外，该框架将跨语言问题对齐提高了超过10个百分点，并提升了数学问题和通用领域文本的翻译质量，在FLORES-200数据集上的COMET得分提升高达8.4分。

Conclusion: TRIT框架通过集成翻译训练，有效解决了长文本推理模型在多语言环境下遇到的问题，显著提高了模型在理解、推理和翻译方面的能力。

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

Result: 该框架在四个跨语言的数据集上进行了评估，能够区分不同的临床组和概念类型。与非累积方法相比，累积嵌入更适用于较长的轨迹。不同的嵌入模型产生了相似的结果。

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

*Lizhuo Luo,Shenggui Li,Yonggang Wen,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present an alternative for text generation with parallel decoding, but naive block inference strategies lead to suboptimal quality and efficiency due to a fixed, predefined schedule. This paper introduces Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) and DSB Cache, training-free methods that dynamically adapt block scheduling to semantic difficulty for improved dLLM inference quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule in dLLMs is suboptimal because it is agnostic to semantic difficulty, leading to premature commitments on uncertain positions and delayed processing of easy positions near block boundaries. This highlights the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that utilizes a sliding block with a dynamic size to address the rigidity of the naive block schedule. Additionally, it introduces DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism specifically designed for DSB to further enhance efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted across multiple models and benchmarks show that DSB, in conjunction with DSB Cache, consistently enhances both the generation quality and inference efficiency of dLLMs.

Conclusion: Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB) and DSB Cache are effective training-free methods that improve the quality and efficiency of diffusion large language model inference by dynamically adapting block scheduling to semantic difficulty, overcoming the limitations of naive, fixed schedules.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

*Jian Chen,Yesheng Liang,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFlash是一种结合了扩散模型和推测性解码的框架，通过并行草稿生成显著提高了大型语言模型的推理速度，实现了超过6倍的无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归大型语言模型（LLM）推理延迟高且GPU利用率低，而现有的推测性解码方法虽然有所改善，但仍然依赖顺序草稿生成，限制了实际的加速效果。扩散LLM虽然支持并行生成，但性能通常不如自回归模型。

Method: 提出DFlash框架，使用轻量级块扩散模型进行并行草稿生成。草稿模型通过单次前向传播生成草稿令牌，并以目标模型提取的上下文特征为条件，以实现高效、高质量的草稿生成和高接受率。

Result: 实验表明，DFlash在多种模型和任务上实现了超过6倍的无损加速，并且比目前最先进的推测性解码方法EAGLE-3快2.5倍。

Conclusion: DFlash通过并行草稿生成有效解决了LLM的推理瓶颈，展示了扩散模型在推测性解码中的潜力，并显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

### [51] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI intelligence is likely to be 'strange intelligence', a nonlinear model where 'general intelligence' is the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, not a unified capacity. This has implications for AI testing, as errors on simple tasks don't necessarily indicate a lack of intelligence, and high performance in one area doesn't guarantee broad capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critique the linear model of AI progress and introduce a nonlinear model of intelligence based on 'familiar' and 'strange' intelligence.

Method: Developing and defending a nonlinear model of intelligence, introducing the concepts of 'familiar intelligence' and 'strange intelligence', and discussing implications for AI evaluation.

Result: AI intelligence is likely to be 'strange intelligence', exhibiting both superhuman and subhuman capacities across and within domains. General intelligence is defined as goal achievement across diverse environments, not a single linear quantity.

Conclusion: AI testing should account for 'strange intelligence', expecting failures on obvious tasks and avoiding assumptions of broad capabilities based on narrow successes. Evaluating AI requires a nuanced approach that recognizes the nonlinear nature of intelligence.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

### [52] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents use a neuro-symbolic approach (MINT) to actively ask humans for information to improve joint planning in uncertain environments, outperforming other methods in benchmarks with unknown objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint planning between humans and AI is crucial, but open-world planning faces challenges due to incomplete information (unknown objects, goals, intents), leading to knowledge gaps. The paper aims to discover optimal AI strategies for actively eliciting human input to bridge these gaps in object-driven planning.

Method: The paper proposes the Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) approach. MINT constructs a symbolic tree of potential human-AI interactions. It uses a neural planning policy to assess planning outcome uncertainty stemming from knowledge gaps. Self-play with MINT optimizes the AI's elicitation strategies and queries. Additionally, LLMs are used to search and summarize MINT's reasoning, curating optimal elicitation queries. The theoretical analysis considers extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps to provide return guarantees for MINT with active human elicitation.

Result: Evaluations on three benchmarks with increasing realism, featuring unseen/unknown objects, demonstrate that MINT-based planning achieves near-expert returns. It requires only a limited number of questions per task, significantly improving rewards and success rates compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: MINT provides an effective neuro-symbolic method for AI agents to actively elicit human input, overcoming knowledge gaps in open-world joint planning. This approach leads to significant improvements in planning performance, even when dealing with unknown objects, by issuing a limited and optimal set of queries.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

### [53] [Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059)
*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)在解决已解决的图论问题（如图的优美性）方面表现良好，能够生成正确的定义、识别相关结构、回忆适当的结果而不产生幻觉，并构建经过专家确认的有效证明。然而，在处理未解决的图论问题时，LLM虽然能生成连贯的解释和合理的探索策略，但未能取得进展，并承认了不确定性，这与其避免捏造定理或未经证实的声明的指令一致。研究结果表明，LLM可以支持对已建立材料的探索，但在需要新颖数学见解或批判性结构推理的任务方面仍然受限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型(LLM)在解决图论问题方面的可靠性，特别是在支持数学严谨性思维方面，以了解其在计算机科学课程中的整合潜力。

Method: 采用一个八阶段评估协议，包括解释、探索、策略形成和证明构建，来检验LLM在已解决和未解决的图论问题上的表现。

Result: LLM在已解决问题上表现强劲，在未解决问题上生成了合理的解释和探索策略但未取得进展，并承认了不确定性。

Conclusion: LLM能够支持对既有知识的探索，但在需要新颖数学见解或批判性结构推理的任务上存在局限性。在计算教育中，应指导学生利用LLM进行概念探索，并辅以独立的验证和严谨的论证进行正式问题解决。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数百万用户使用生成式AI进行心理支持，AI在心理健康领域的安全问题至关重要，需要一个基于证据的自动化安全基准。

Method: 通过模拟用户-AI对话，并由临床医生和AI法官根据评分标准进行评估，以检验VERA-MH评估在临床有效性和可靠性方面的能力。

Result: 临床医生在安全评分方面具有良好的一致性（IRR: 0.77），AI法官与临床共识高度一致（IRR: 0.81）。此外，临床医生认为模拟用户具有真实性。

Conclusion: VERA-MH评估在AI心理健康安全方面是临床有效且可靠的，为AI心理健康工具的安全应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Günther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种用于近地轨道主动碎片清除（ADR）任务的自主任务规划器：标准的蒙版近端策略优化（PPO）、领域随机化的蒙版PPO以及蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在近地轨道上为主动碎片清除（ADR）进行自主任务规划，需要在效率、适应性和燃料、任务持续时间的严格可行性约束之间进行平衡。

Method: 通过高保真轨道模拟，包括加注燃料、真实转移动力学和随机碎片场，在名义、燃料减少和时间减少三种场景下，对三种规划器（标准的蒙版PPO、领域随机化的蒙版PPO和MCTS）进行了评估。

Result: 标准的PPO在与训练条件匹配时表现最佳，但在分布变化下性能急剧下降。领域随机化的PPO适应性更强，但名义性能略有下降。MCTS由于在线重新规划，在处理约束变化方面表现最好，但计算时间是其他方法的数倍。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了学习策略的速度和基于搜索的方法的适应性之间的权衡，并提出将训练时多样性与在线规划相结合可能是未来构建有弹性的ADR任务规划器的有前景的途径。

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

### [56] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI对齐方法（如RLHF）依赖于人类评分者，但评分者样本常常存在系统性的人口统计偏差。本文提出了一种名为民主偏好优化（DemPO）的框架，该框架使用算法抽签（类似于公民大会的机制）来解决此问题。DemPO包含两种训练方案：硬面板（Hard Panel）仅使用抽签选取的、满足配额的‘迷你公众’的偏好进行训练；软面板（Soft Panel）保留所有数据，但根据抽签概率重新加权每个评分者。研究证明，软面板的加权方法能够以闭式形式恢复硬面板的目标。通过使用包含评分者人口统计信息和美国代表性公众独立提供的75项宪法条款的公开偏好数据集，并对不同规模（10亿至80亿参数）的Llama模型进行评估，结果显示硬面板方案表现最优，软面板方案优于未加权基线，并且模型容量越大，效果越显著。这表明在偏好收集阶段就强制执行人口统计代表性，而非事后修正，可以使模型行为更好地反映代表性公众所表达的价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于偏好的AI对齐方法（如RLHF）依赖于便利性抽样的人类评分者，这些评分者通常在人口统计学上存在系统性偏差，导致AI模型可能无法反映广泛人群的价值观。

Method: 提出民主偏好优化（DemPO）框架，该框架采用算法抽签机制进行偏好数据收集和模型微调。具体包括两种训练方案：1. 硬面板（Hard Panel）：仅使用通过抽签选取的、满足人口统计配额的“迷你公众”的偏好数据进行训练。2. 软面板（Soft Panel）：使用所有偏好数据，但根据抽签概率对每个评分者的数据进行加权。理论上证明了软面板加权可以恢复硬面板的目标。

Result: 在包含人口统计信息和代表性公众制定的宪法条款的公开偏好数据集上，使用不同规模（10亿至80亿参数）的Llama模型进行评估。结果显示，在六种不同的聚合方法下，硬面板方案的性能始终最优，软面板方案始终优于未加权基线，且模型容量越大，效果提升越明显。

Conclusion: 在偏好收集阶段强制执行人口统计代表性（如DemPO框架所示），比事后修正更能使AI模型的行为与代表性公众的价值观保持一致。

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

TL;DR: The CAST-CKT framework uses chaos theory to improve cross-city traffic prediction in data-scarce scenarios, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts, and existing methods struggle with the chaotic nature of traffic for few-shot learning.

Method: CAST-CKT employs a chaotic analyser for predictability regimes, chaos-aware attention for adaptive temporal modeling, adaptive topology learning for spatial dependencies, and chaotic consistency for cross-city knowledge transfer. It also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification.

Result: CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE on four cross-city few-shot benchmarks and provides interpretable regime analysis.

Conclusion: CAST-CKT effectively addresses the challenges of cross-city traffic prediction in data-scarce settings by leveraging chaos theory for improved accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Motivation: 现有图谱RAG方法过度依赖节点表面匹配，缺乏显式的因果建模，导致答案不准确或虚假。将因果关系整合进来的方法通常局限于局部或单文档，且模块化结构导致信息孤立，影响可扩展性和跨模块的因果推理。

Method: 提出HugRAG框架，通过层级模块间的因果门控（causal gating across hierarchical modules）来重构知识组织，显式地建模因果关系，抑制虚假关联，并实现大规模知识图谱上的可扩展推理。

Result: 在多个数据集和评估指标上，HugRAG的性能持续优于有竞争力的图谱RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: HugRAG为结构化、可扩展且基于因果的RAG系统奠定了原则性基础。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

TL;DR: 有害微调会危及大语言模型的安全对齐。本文提出一种名为“手术”(Surgery)的防御方法，利用注意力汇聚点发散机制来缓解有害微调。该方法通过正则化来抑制注意力汇聚点发散，将注意力头引导至负发散组，从而降低模型学习和放大有害模式的倾向。实验结果表明，“手术”方法在 BeaverTails、HarmBench 和 SorryBench 基准测试中分别提高了 5.90%、11.25% 和 9.55% 的防御性能。

Motivation: 有害微调可能破坏大语言模型的安全对齐，带来严重的安全风险。

Method: 本文利用注意力汇聚点发散机制来缓解有害微调。首先，计算每个注意力头的汇聚点发散度量，并观察到不同注意力头表现出不同的发散符号。然后，提出分离式汇聚点发散假设，即与微调过程中学习有害模式相关的注意力头可以通过其汇聚点发散符号进行分离。基于此假设，提出一种在微调阶段的防御方法“手术”，该方法使用汇聚点发散抑制正则化器，将注意力头引导至负发散组。

Result: “手术”方法在 BeaverTails、HarmBench 和 SorryBench 基准测试中分别提高了 5.90%、11.25% 和 9.55% 的防御性能。

Conclusion: “手术”方法通过引导注意力头至负发散组，有效降低了模型学习和放大有害模式的倾向，显著提高了模型的安全性。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 余弦相似度（Cosine Similarity）在现实世界的语义空间中存在局限性，因为它只能捕捉线性关系。本文提出了一种新的相似度度量方法 recos，该方法通过对向量分量进行排序并进行归一化来计算点积，从而放宽了对完美相似性的要求，从严格的线性相关性转向了序数一致性，能够捕捉更广泛的关系。在 11 种不同的嵌入模型上的实验表明，recos 相比余弦相似度在语义文本相似性（STS）基准测试中与人类判断的相关性更高，是一种更优的语义分析替代方案。

Motivation: 标准的余弦相似度度量方法在数学上受限于柯西-施瓦茨不等式，这限制了它只能捕捉线性关系，而无法有效模拟现实世界中复杂的、非线性的语义空间结构。

Method: 提出了一种新的相似度度量方法 recos。该方法通过对向量分量进行排序，并用排序后的向量分量对点积进行归一化。这从严格的线性依赖关系放宽到序数一致性，从而能够捕捉更广泛的关系。

Result: 在 11 种不同的嵌入模型（包括静态、上下文化和通用类型）上进行的广泛实验表明，recos 持续优于传统的余弦相似度，在标准的语义文本相似性（STS）基准测试中与人类判断的相关性更高。

Conclusion: recos 是一种在数学上合理且在经验上更优的替代方案，能够提高在复杂嵌入空间中进行语义分析的准确性。

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil Lupu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM在安全管理中的决策支持框架，通过迭代循环、一致性检查和外部反馈来控制幻觉风险并优化响应计划，实验显示可减少30%的恢复时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在安全管理任务中很有前景，但存在不可靠和易产生幻觉的问题，需要一个原则性的框架来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出一个迭代框架，LLM生成候选行动，通过系统约束和前瞻性预测进行一致性检查。若不一致，则通过外部反馈（如在数字孪生中评估）来收集信息，并通过上下文学习（ICL）优化候选行动。

Result: 在四个公开数据集的事件响应用例中，该框架相比前沿LLM能将恢复时间减少高达30%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过调整一致性阈值有效控制了LLM的幻觉风险，并在一定假设下提供了ICL的遗憾界限，证明了其在安全管理中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

### [64] [Position: Universal Time Series Foundation Models Rest on a Category Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05287)
*Xilin Dai,Wanxu Cai,Zhijian Xu,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Time series foundation models face issues due to incompatible generative processes, leading to 'Generic Filters'. A new 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound' shows history-only models can't predict shifts. The paper proposes a 'Causal Control Agent' paradigm with specialized solvers and advocates for benchmarks focusing on 'Drift Adaptation Speed' instead of 'Zero-Shot Accuracy'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper argues that the pursuit of universal foundation models for time series is based on a category error, conflating a structural container with a semantic modality. Time series have incompatible generative processes, causing monolithic models to become ineffective 'Generic Filters' that fail to generalize under distributional drift.

Method: The paper introduces the 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound', a theoretical limit demonstrating that models relying solely on historical data cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. It proposes a 'Causal Control Agent' paradigm that utilizes external context to manage a hierarchy of specialized solvers, including domain experts and Just-in-Time adaptors.

Result: The theoretical 'Autoregressive Blindness Bound' is presented, which bounds the predictability of intervention-driven regime shifts for history-only models. The proposed 'Causal Control Agent' paradigm offers a framework for more robust time series analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the focus should shift from universal models to a 'Causal Control Agent' paradigm. It advocates for changing benchmarks from 'Zero-Shot Accuracy' to 'Drift Adaptation Speed' to encourage the development of more robust, control-theoretic time series systems.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在需要战略推理、心智理论和经济价值创造的中心商业任务——谈判——中的能力，并引入一个大规模的谈判基准（PieArena）来支持这一评估。

Method: 使用PieArena基准，该基准基于商学院MBA谈判课程中的多智能体交互和现实场景。研究了GPT-5等前沿模型，并与商学院学生进行了比较。同时，研究了联合意向性支架对不同水平LLMs的影响。

Result: GPT-5等前沿模型在谈判任务中表现出AGI水平，匹配或超越了接受过培训的商学院学生。联合意向性支架对中低水平LLMs有显著提升，但对前沿LLMs的边际效益递减。PieArena基准揭示了LLMs在欺骗、计算准确性、指令遵循和声誉感知等方面的多维度行为异质性。

Conclusion: 前沿语言模型在智力和心理层面已具备在高风险经济环境中的应用潜力，但在鲁棒性和可信度方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

### [66] [RaBiT: Residual-Aware Binarization Training for Accurate and Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05367)
*Youngcheon You,Banseok Lee,Minseop Choi,Seonyoung Kim,Hyochan Chong,Changdong Kim,Youngmin Kim,Dongkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Residual binarization methods for LLMs suffer from inter-path adaptation, where parallel paths learn redundant features, degrading performance. RaBiT framework addresses this by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy, deriving each binary path from a shared full-precision weight to ensure error correction. This leads to state-of-the-art 2-bit accuracy, competitive performance with VQ methods, and a significant inference speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the performance degradation caused by inter-path adaptation in residual binarization for LLMs, which limits the effectiveness of low-bit quantization.

Method: Proposing RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that enforces a residual hierarchy by sequentially deriving each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight. This is stabilized by a robust initialization prioritizing functional preservation.

Result: RaBiT achieves state-of-the-art performance for 2-bit quantization, rivals hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and provides a 4.49x inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Conclusion: RaBiT redefines the accuracy-efficiency frontier for 2-bit LLM inference by effectively resolving the inter-path adaptation issue through a hierarchical residual structure, offering significant performance and speed benefits.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在眼科领域，领域特定的医学大语言模型在患者教育、分诊和临床决策支持方面的应用日益广泛，因此，进行严格的评估以确保其安全性和准确性至关重要。

Method: 本研究采用横断面研究设计，让四种小型医学大语言模型（参数量<10B）回答180个眼科患者查询，共生成2160个回答。使用S.C.O.R.E.框架（评估安全性、共识与背景、客观性、可重复性和可解释性）对模型回答进行评分，评分等级为五点李克特量表。由三名不同资历的眼科医生和GPT-4-Turbo进行评估，并使用Spearman秩相关、Kendall tau统计和核密度估计分析来评估LLM评分与临床医生评分之间的一致性。

Result: Meerkat-7B模型表现最佳，其平均得分在资深顾问、顾问和住院医师的评分中分别为3.44、4.08和4.18。MedLLaMA3-v20模型表现最差，25.5%的回答包含幻觉或临床误导性内容。GPT-4-Turbo的评分与临床医生评分总体上高度一致（Spearman rho=0.80, Kendall tau=0.67），但资深顾问的评分更为保守。

Conclusion: 医学大语言模型在眼科安全问答方面展现出潜力，但在临床深度和共识方面仍有不足。研究证明了基于大语言模型进行大规模基准测试的可行性，并强调需要结合自动化评估和临床医生评审的混合框架来指导模型的安全临床应用。

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

TL;DR: THOR是一种用于超关系知识图谱（HKG）的归纳式链接预测技术，通过构建关系和实体基础图，并利用图编码器和Transformer解码器进行学习，实现了在不同数据集上的优于现有技术的性能，并证明了其跨HKG结构不变性的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超关系知识图谱链接预测技术主要采用转导式学习，仅限于特定词汇，泛化能力受限。因此，需要开发一种能够处理未见词汇的归纳式链接预测技术。

Method: 首先，提出关系和实体基础图，对HKG中的基本交互进行建模，使其不依赖于具体的关系和实体。然后，利用两个并行的图编码器和Transformer解码器来学习这两个基础图，支持掩码训练和完全归纳式推理。

Result: 在12个不同设置的数据集上进行评估，THOR在超关系链接预测任务上，相比于最优的基于规则、半归纳式和全归纳式技术，分别提高了66.1%、55.9%和20.4%。消融研究也揭示了该模型捕捉可迁移结构不变性的关键设计因素。

Conclusion: THOR是一种有效的超关系知识图谱的归纳式链接预测技术，通过基础图和Transformer架构，能够学习并迁移知识到新的、未见的词汇，显著优于现有方法，并证明了其在处理HKG归纳任务中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

Incorporating exogenous factors and using a spike regularization strategy further enhance their accuracy, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial but challenging due to price volatility and nonlinearity. Existing models struggle with temporal dependencies and heterogeneous data integration. The effectiveness of TSFMs in day-ahead EPF, especially in volatile markets, needs further investigation.

Method: Evaluated TSFMs (TTMs, MOIRAI, MOMENT, TimesFM) against traditional models (ARIMA, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly Singapore wholesale market data with volatile trends. Incorporated exogenous factors (weather, calendar variables) and a spike regularization strategy.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperformed traditional models, showing up to 37.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across different evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: TSFMs offer a promising approach for improving electricity price forecast accuracy in volatile markets, providing practical insights for stakeholders in energy markets.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Conclusion: OD-CRL框架通过引入AOBO和NSDP，有效地解决了现有条件表示学习方法的局限性，并在多项定制任务中展现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习（RL）依赖于代价高昂、易碎且无法理解底层逻辑的标量奖励，阻碍了大型语言模型（LLM）在专家级推理方面的发展，并限制了模型对推理原则的深度、内源性理解。

Method: ALIVE框架整合了问题提出、解决和判断，通过生成式反馈和对抗性学习，使模型能够从原始语料库中内化评估标准，将外部批评转化为内源性推理能力。

Conclusion: ALIVE框架能够有效地克服奖励信号的局限性，并提供一种可扩展的、无需人工监督的通用推理对齐基础，促进了能力增长的自我维持轨迹。

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

Conclusion: Phi-former通过整合分子片段的生物学作用，提高了CPI预测的准确性和可解释性，有望指导理性药物设计和支持精准医疗。

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型中的错位行为具有挑战性，因为模型可能会在训练过程中学会隐藏不良行为。标准的审计技术，如黑盒方法和机制可解释性，都存在局限性。

Method: SPT方法在LoRA参数中引入了一个“诚实人格”，该人格在正常运行时不被激活。在主模型生成响应后，激活该诚实人格并插入触发字符串，以便其审查响应并访问模型潜在状态。

Conclusion: SPT是一种有效的方法，可以检测大型语言模型中隐藏的错位行为，并能揭示模型内部的潜在知识。

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

*Stephen Pilli,Vivek Nallur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can accurately predict and emulate individual-level cognitive biases, even under varying cognitive loads, by analyzing demographic data and dialogue transcripts. Differences were observed between GPT-4 and GPT-5 in their emulation of human behavior, highlighting implications for bias-aware AI system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs can predict individual-level cognitive biases and mimic the dynamics of biased human behavior influenced by contextual factors like cognitive load.

Method: Adapted three decision-making scenarios into a conversational format for a human experiment (N=1100) with a chatbot under simple or complex dialogue conditions. Subsequently, used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with GPT-4 and GPT-5 LLMs.

Result: Human participants exhibited robust biases. LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) reproduced these human biases with high accuracy. Notable differences were found in how the LLMs aligned with human behavior, suggesting varying emulation capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate the capability to precisely reproduce and predict individual-level cognitive biases in interactive contexts, similar to humans, under varying cognitive loads. Observed discrepancies between GPT-4 and GPT-5 in emulating human behavior underscore the importance of considering LLM specifics when designing bias-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

TL;DR: In low-resource languages, data scarcity hinders NLP progress. This paper explores cross-lingual knowledge transfer, introducing GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation), a novel GNN-based method. GETR significantly outperforms baselines, improving POS tagging by 13 percentage points on Mizo and Khasi, and achieving 20-27 percentage point F1 improvements on Marathi, Bangla, and Malayalam for sentiment classification and NER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing effective NLP systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources, lagging behind high-resource languages. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer is a promising approach to address this.

Method: The paper introduces GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation), a novel GNN-based method for cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and compares it with two baselines: augmentation in hidden layers and token embedding transfer through token translation. The focus is on sentence-level and word-level tasks for low-resource languages with hundreds of labeled instances.

Result: The GNN-based GETR approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed GETR method, utilizing a GNN-based approach for cross-lingual knowledge transfer, demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods for low-resource languages across various NLP tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of graph-enhanced token representation in overcoming data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

*Simon Kohaut,Benedict Flade,Julian Eggert,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models is computationally expensive, especially for autonomous agents needing real-time belief updates. This paper introduces Resin, a probabilistic programming language, and Reactive Circuits (RCs), a time-dynamic meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits, to enable efficient, asynchronous, and exact probabilistic reasoning. RCs adapt to input signal volatility, partitioning computations based on estimated change frequency to reduce redundant computations and achieve significant speedups in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents in dynamic environments require efficient, real-time belief updates for probabilistic models, but existing methods are computationally prohibitive and re-evaluate the entire model for every change, failing to leverage heterogeneous update rates of real-world information streams.

Method: The paper introduces Resin, a probabilistic programming language merging probabilistic logic with reactive programming. For efficient and exact semantics, it proposes Reactive Circuits (RCs), which are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams. RCs adapt autonomously based on input signal volatility by partitioning computations according to estimated change frequency.

Result: In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, the proposed approach achieved several orders of magnitude of speedup compared to frequency-agnostic inference. The structural adaptations of RCs successfully captured environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and enabling reactive real-time reasoning by decomposing inference tasks into memoized sub-problems.

Conclusion: Reactive Circuits (RCs) provide an efficient and exact method for probabilistic reasoning in streaming contexts. By adapting to input signal volatility and partitioning computations based on estimated change frequency, RCs avoid redundant computations and enable significant speedups, facilitating reactive real-time reasoning for autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

### [80] [Generative Ontology: When Structured Knowledge Learns to Create](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05636)
*Benny Cheung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Ontology combines traditional ontologies with LLMs to create structured, novel artifacts. It uses executable schemas and multi-agent systems with specialized roles and 'anxieties' to ensure creative yet valid outputs. Demonstrated with GameGrammar for tabletop game generation, the framework generalizes to other domains like music and software architecture, arguing that constraints enable creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ontologies lack novelty generation, while LLMs lack structural validity. This work addresses the need for a system that combines the structural rigor of ontologies with the creative fluency of LLMs to generate novel, structurally sound artifacts.

Method: The framework, Generative Ontology, encodes domain knowledge into executable Pydantic schemas which constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to ontology domains, with each agent possessing a unique 'anxiety' to prevent superficial outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds designs in existing exemplars, and iterative validation ensures coherence.

Result: The framework was demonstrated through GameGrammar, a system that generates complete tabletop game designs from thematic prompts. The generated specifications include mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions, satisfying ontological constraints while exhibiting creativity.

Conclusion: The Generative Ontology framework is generalizable beyond games to any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars. The paper argues that ontological constraints, rather than limiting creativity, enable structured generation, analogous to how grammar enables poetry.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems. All the related resources, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphMemory.

TL;DR: LLM推理的能效呈现非线性特征，并非输入输出序列越长能耗越高，存在一个“甜蜜点”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM能耗估算方法多基于线性的输入输出长度模型，但研究发现LLM的能效与序列长度之间存在非线性关系，需要更精确的模型来表征。

Method: 提出一个基于Transformer计算和内存访问复杂度的分析模型，该模型能将能效表示为输入输出长度的函数。在NVIDIA H100 GPU上使用TensorRT-LLM对多种LLM（1B-9B参数）进行能耗评估，覆盖64-4096的序列长度，以验证模型精度（平均MAPE为1.79%）。

Result: LLM的能效“甜蜜点”出现在中等长度的输入和输出时，过长或过短的输入输出都会导致能效下降。通过将序列长度与“甜蜜点”对齐，可以显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: LLM的能效与序列长度的关系是非线性的，存在特定的“甜蜜点”。通过优化输入输出序列长度以匹配这些“甜蜜点”，可以在生产环境中通过截断、摘要和自适应生成等策略有效降低LLM的能源消耗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

TL;DR: GenLoRA通过使用轻量级非线性函数（径向基函数）生成低秩矩阵的基向量，取代了LoRA中显式存储基向量的方法，从而实现了更高的参数效率和更好的微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA在增加模型容量时需要增加低秩矩阵的行列数，导致参数量显著增长，而其基向量存在参数冗余，可以通过轻量级非线性函数进行紧凑表示。

Method: 提出Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA)，为每个低秩矩阵维护一个潜在向量，并使用一组轻量级的径向基函数（RBFs）来合成基向量，用参数效率更高的方式替代显式存储基向量。

Result: GenLoRA在相同的参数预算下能够达到更高的有效LoRA秩，并在多项数据集和架构的实验中展现出优越的微调性能。

Conclusion: GenLoRA通过非线性生成基向量，在参数效率和模型性能上优于标准LoRA。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: RLVR 存在递归空间收缩（RSC）问题，导致有效替代方案的采样概率消失。KL 正则化旨在缓解此问题，但会引入强制策略模仿参考模型完整密度的形状匹配约束，从而与正确性所需的锐化产生梯度冲突。我们提出了锚定策略优化（APO），将范式从全局形状匹配转移到支持覆盖。通过定义基于参考模型高置信度支持的安全流形，APO 允许进行积极的锐化以提高效率，并在纠错过程中选择性地调用恢复力以防止崩溃。我们从理论上推导出 APO 可作为最大化支持覆盖的梯度对齐机制，实现弹性恢复，重新膨胀有效分支。在数学基准上的实证评估表明，APO 打破了准确性-多样性权衡，在提高 Pass@1 的同时，恢复了标准策略梯度方法通常会丢失的 Pass@K 多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: RLFKV框架通过细粒度知识验证和信息量奖励，能够有效提升金融RAG系统回答的忠实度和信息量，解决了模型幻觉问题。

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习（RL）的VLA模型训练框架（如RLinf）虽然能增强模型泛化能力，但其同步执行机制在环境交互、策略生成和模型更新阶段导致严重的资源利用不足和吞吐量限制，成为训练效率的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出并实现了一个全异步的策略训练框架，该框架整合了环境交互、轨迹收集、策略生成和训练更新的整个流程。框架采用了多层次解耦架构，包括环境交互和轨迹收集的异步并行化、策略生成的流式执行以及训练更新的解耦调度。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，该框架实现了高达59.25%的吞吐量提升，通过深度优化分离策略可达126.67%。消融实验验证了每个异步组件的有效性。8到256个GPU的可扩展性验证表明该方法在大多数情况下具有良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该全异步训练框架有效解决了现有VLA模型训练效率低下的问题，显著提高了吞吐量和资源利用率，并具备良好的可扩展性，为实现通用的具身智能提供了更高效的训练途径。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

*Shengpu Wang,Yuhao Mao,Yani Zhang,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Boolean neural networks offer a more efficient alternative to floating-point networks for resource-constrained environments, but learning them is difficult due to their combinatorial nature. This paper proposes a three-pronged approach: learned connections, compact convolutions, and adaptive discretization. The proposed methods result in significant improvements in accuracy versus computation trade-offs compared to existing methods, achieving better accuracy with substantially fewer operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point neural networks have high inference costs, making Boolean networks desirable for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging.

Method: The paper proposes three strategies: 1) learning efficient connections without additional parameters or computational overhead, 2) introducing a compact convolutional Boolean architecture that reduces Boolean operations by exploiting locality, and 3) using an adaptive discretization strategy to minimize accuracy loss during conversion from continuous-valued to Boolean networks.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard vision benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in terms of the accuracy vs. computation trade-off, achieving higher accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of learning compact and accurate Boolean networks, offering a promising direction for efficient deep learning in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning. OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.

To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.

Motivation: 目前，大型组织中的层级座位分配问题依赖手动管理，导致规划频率低且效果不佳。本研究的动机是开发一个自动化的解决方案，以应对这种挑战。

Method: 该方法结合了概率路线图（PRM）和快速扩展随机树（RRT）来计算座位间的距离，并利用启发式搜索和动态规划结合整数规划来解决HSAP问题。

Result: 研究通过在不同规模的实例中评估PRM框架和后续的座位分配，从定量和定性两方面展示了所提出方法的效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的端到端框架能够有效地解决分层座位分配问题，为具有复杂层级结构的大型组织提供了一个自动化的座位规划解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

TL;DR: LLMs are increasingly used in M&S, but naive application can lead to issues. This paper offers practical guidance on using LLMs in M&S, covering common pitfalls like non-determinism and knowledge augmentation, and emphasizing principled design, diagnostics, and evaluation for informed decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers and practitioners are increasingly using LLMs in M&S workflows, but straightforward practices can introduce subtle issues, complexity, or suboptimal results. There is a need for comprehensive and practical guidance on effectively using LLMs in this domain.

Method: The paper discusses common sources of confusion in LLM application, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (RAG, LoRA), M&S data decomposition, and hyper-parameter settings. It emphasizes principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation.

Result: The paper provides guidance to help modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs in M&S applications by addressing common pitfalls and promoting best practices.

Conclusion: Effective utilization of LLMs in M&S requires careful consideration of their characteristics, common pitfalls, and proper evaluation methods. This paper aims to equip modelers with the knowledge to make informed decisions and avoid potential issues, ultimately leading to better M&S outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典强化学习模型在解决CVRP等组合优化问题方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化和足够大的数据集，语音情感识别（SER）研究受到限制。本研究旨在探索利用预训练模型（特别是Whisper）提取特征用于SER的可行性。

Method: 本研究提出了两种基于注意力机制的池化方法——多头平均注意力池化（Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling）和QKV池化（QKV Pooling），用于降低Whisper模型表示的维度并保留情感特征。在英语和波斯语数据集（IEMOCAP和ShEMO）上，使用Whisper Tiny和Small模型进行了实验。此外，还比较了不同Whisper编码器层在SER任务上的性能。

Result: 在波斯语ShEMO数据集上，本研究提出的多头QKV池化方法取得了最先进的性能，非加权准确率提高了2.47%。研究还发现，对于波斯语SER任务，Whisper的中间层比顶层表现更好。与大型模型（如HuBERT X-Large）相比，Whisper提供了一种轻量级且高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: Whisper模型在作为SER任务的特征提取器方面具有巨大潜力。基于注意力机制的池化方法能有效降低维度并保留关键情感信息，为SER研究提供了一种更轻量级、更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了一种高到中等保真度的模拟工作流程，为开发和评估自主学校安全干预措施提供了一个可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AIF, a graph-based network flow model, traces RAG responses to specific tool components by decomposing outputs into indivisible information atoms. A trained Gemma3-4B model uses AIF signals to improve accuracy to 82.71% and compress context by 87.52%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-based RAG systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components, which is a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures.

Method: AIF models LLM orchestration as a directed flow of information atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink. A lightweight Gemma3-4B language model is trained as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF, inspired by the max-flow min-cut theorem.

Result: The trained Gemma3-4B model achieves 82.71% accuracy on HotpotQA (a +28.01 point improvement) and 87.52% context token compression, outperforming the base Gemma3-4B model and rivaling the Gemma3-27B variant.

Conclusion: AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability in RAG systems. A lightweight model trained on AIF signals can significantly improve accuracy and context compression, making it competitive with much larger models.

Abstract: Many tool-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components -- a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures. We present \textbf{Atomic Information Flow (AIF)}, a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into atoms: indivisible, self-contained units of information. By modeling LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink, AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability.
  Motivated by the max-flow min-cut theorem in network flow theory, we train a lightweight Gemma3 (4B parameter) language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF. We note that the base Gemma3-4B model struggles to identify critical information with \textbf{54.7\%} accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines (BM25). However, post-training on AIF signals boosts accuracy to \textbf{82.71\%} (+28.01 points) while achieving \textbf{87.52\%} (+1.85\%) context token compression -- bridging the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly $7\times$ larger.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着密集检索任务复杂度的增加，向量和内积的局限性日益显现，因此探究嵌入维度对检索性能的影响至关重要。

Method: 通过对两个模型家族和不同模型尺寸进行实验，分析了嵌入维度与检索性能的关系，并发现了其遵循幂律分布。

Result: 在与训练任务一致的评估任务中，性能随嵌入维度的增加而提升，但收益递减；在与训练任务不一致的评估任务中，性能表现不稳定，甚至可能随嵌入维度的增加而下降。

Conclusion: 论文提出了能够根据嵌入维度预测性能的标度律，并为选择模型和嵌入维度提供了实践指导，以在降低存储和计算成本的同时优化性能。

Abstract: Dense retrieval, which encodes queries and documents into a single dense vector, has become the dominant neural retrieval approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.

*Yuntong Hu,Sha Li,Naren Ramakrishnan,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAG系统通过查询时调整来提高鲁棒性，但这些调整是瞬时的。本文提出了Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM)框架，通过正确性门控反馈更新检索索引，将瞬时收益转化为持久的检索改进，实现了零推理时间开销，并在多个基准测试中提高了检索和生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统虽然通过查询时调整（如查询扩展、迭代检索）提高了鲁棒性，但这些调整是瞬时的，无法累积学习，且会重复产生推理成本。而索引端的方法（如键扩展）虽然具有持久性，但依赖于离线预处理或启发式更新，与下游任务的关联性较弱，容易导致语义漂移和噪声累积。

Method: 提出Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM)框架，该框架无需训练，通过正确性门控反馈来更新检索索引。ERM将原子扩展信号选择性地归因于其受益的文档键，并通过稳定的、范数受限的更新逐步演进键。证明了查询扩展和键扩展在标准相似度函数下是理论上等价的，并证明了ERM的选择性更新的收敛性，将最优查询扩展均摊到稳定的索引中，实现了零推理时间开销。

Result: 在BEIR和BRIGHT跨13个领域的实验表明，ERM在检索和生成方面均取得了持续的提升，尤其是在推理密集型任务上，并且检索速度与原生检索相当。

Conclusion: ERM框架通过正确性门控反馈，将瞬时的查询时检索改进转化为持久的索引改进，实现了零推理时间开销，并在各种任务和领域中表现出优越的检索和生成性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems commonly improve robustness via query-time adaptations such as query expansion and iterative retrieval. While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead. Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT across 13 domains demonstrate consistent gains in retrieval and generation, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, at native retrieval speed.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLMs可以通过集成外部工具与现实世界进行交互并解决复杂任务。然而，随着工具数量的增加，有效检索工具变得至关重要。现有方法将工具检索视为传统的检索任务，将用户查询与整个原始工具文档进行匹配，存在文档不完整、语义和粒度不匹配以及工具效用多方面性等问题。本文提出了一种名为“多字段工具检索”的框架，通过细粒度的多字段建模来解决这些挑战，实现了最先进的性能和优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多字段工具检索框架能够有效应对现有工具检索方法的挑战，通过多维度细粒度建模显著提升了LLM集成外部工具的能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with real-world environments and solve complex tasks. Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling. Experimental results show that our framework achieves SOTA performance on five datasets and a mixed benchmark, exhibiting superior generalizability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升用户搜索满意度方面存在两个主要局限：未能充分模拟用户多方面的意图，以及忽视了视觉信号等丰富的侧面信息。

Method: 研究提出了一种名为“富媒体重排”（Rich-Media Re-Ranker）的框架。该框架首先通过“查询规划器”（Query Planner）分析会话中查询的细化序列，以捕捉真正的搜索意图，并将查询分解为清晰、互补的子查询。然后，除了主要的文本内容，该框架还整合了候选结果更丰富的侧面信息，包括利用基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的评估器生成的视觉内容信号。这些综合信号与精心设计的重排原则（考虑内容相关性、质量、信息增益、信息新颖性以及封面图像的视觉呈现）一起进行处理。最后，基于大型语言模型（LLM）的重排器基于这些原则和综合信号进行整体评估。为了增强VLM评估器和LLM重排器的场景适应性，研究还通过多任务强化学习进一步提升了它们的能力。

Result: 通过广泛的实验证明，该方法显著优于现有的基线方法。所提出的框架已成功应用于大规模工业搜索系统中，在线用户参与度和满意度指标均得到大幅提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的富媒体重排框架通过多维度、细粒度的建模，并整合了视觉内容信号，显著提升了用户搜索满意度，并在实际工业应用中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Re-ranking plays a crucial role in modern information search systems by refining the ranking of initial search results to better satisfy user information needs. However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics.

Result: SciDef在DefExtra和DefSim数据集上进行了测试，评估了16种语言模型和不同的提示策略，发现在多步和DSPy优化提示下，提取性能得到提升。在评估提取效果时，基于NLI的方法被证明是最可靠的。LLM在从科学文献中提取定义方面表现出很高的能力（86.4%的准确率），但存在过度生成定义的问题。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效地从科学文献中提取定义，但未来的工作应侧重于识别相关定义，以解决模型过度生成定义的问题。

Abstract: Definitions are the foundation for any scientific work, but with a significant increase in publication numbers, gathering definitions relevant to any keyword has become challenging. We therefore introduce SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction. We test SciDef on DefExtra & DefSim, novel datasets of human-extracted definitions and definition-pairs' similarity, respectively. Evaluating 16 language models across prompting strategies, we demonstrate that multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting improve extraction performance. To evaluate extraction, we test various metrics and show that an NLI-based method yields the most reliable results. We show that LLMs are largely able to extract definitions from scientific literature (86.4% of definitions from our test-set); yet future work should focus not just on finding definitions, but on identifying relevant ones, as models tend to over-generate them.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Text retrieval with learned sparse representations is effective, but the forward index is large. This paper investigates compression techniques for the forward index, finding StreamVByte to be a good option. It then introduces DotVByte, an improved algorithm for inner product computation, which achieves significant space savings on MsMarco without compromising retrieval efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The large size of the forward index in learned sparse representations for text retrieval hinders practical application. This work aims to find compression techniques to reduce the forward index's storage footprint without negatively impacting search quality or latency.

Method: The paper analyzes the efficiency of sparse retrieval algorithms, focusing on compressing the forward index. It examines various integer compression techniques, identifies StreamVByte as a strong candidate, and proposes an improved algorithm called DotVByte, specifically designed for inner product computation.

Result: Experiments on MsMarco demonstrate that DotVByte achieves significant space savings compared to StreamVByte while maintaining retrieval efficiency. The proposed improvements lead to a reduced memory footprint without compromising search performance.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the issue of large forward index sizes in sparse retrieval by introducing DotVByte, an effective compression technique that offers substantial space savings and maintains retrieval efficiency, making sparse retrieval more practical.

Abstract: Text retrieval using learned sparse representations of queries and documents has, over the years, evolved into a highly effective approach to search. It is thanks to recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search-with the emergence of highly efficient algorithms such as the inverted index-based Seismic and the graph-based Hnsw-that retrieval with sparse representations became viable in practice. In this work, we scrutinize the efficiency of sparse retrieval algorithms and focus particularly on the size of a data structure that is common to all algorithmic flavors and that constitutes a substantial fraction of the overall index size: the forward index. In particular, we seek compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint of the forward index without compromising search quality or inner product computation latency. In our examination with various integer compression techniques, we report that StreamVByte achieves the best trade-off between memory footprint, retrieval accuracy, and latency. We then improve StreamVByte by introducing DotVByte, a new algorithm tailored to inner product computation. Experiments on MsMarco show that our improvements lead to significant space savings while maintaining retrieval efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的基于动机的推荐系统未能充分利用评论文本等异构信息，并且在多模态动机融合时面临跨模态对齐不稳定和跨模态特征映射困难的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为LMMRec的、模型无关的框架，该框架利用大语言模型（LLM）提取细粒度的用户和物品动机，并采用双编码器架构结合链式思考提示（chain-of-thought prompting）来融合文本和交互动机。通过动机协调策略（Motivation Coordination Strategy）和交互-文本对应方法（Interaction-Text Correspondence Method）进行对比学习和动量更新，以应对噪声和语义漂移。

Conclusion: LMMRec通过利用LLM的深层语义先验知识和动机理解能力，有效地解决了多模态推荐中的动机融合问题，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Motivation-based recommendation systems uncover user behavior drivers. Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates. Experiments on three datasets show LMMRec achieves up to a 4.98\% performance improvement.

Conclusion: GLASS框架通过有效集成长期用户兴趣，显著提高了生成式推荐系统的性能，并在真实数据集上取得了优于现有方法的成果。

Abstract: Leveraging long-term user behavioral patterns is a key trajectory for enhancing the accuracy of modern recommender systems. While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation.

Abstract: General-purpose text embedding models underpin a wide range of NLP and information retrieval applications, and are typically trained on large-scale multi-task corpora to encourage broad generalization. However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.

Motivation: 生成高质量的、具有约束性的、适用于下游推荐应用的物品自然语言表示（描述符）是推荐系统的核心需求。现有的LLM-based描述符生成框架在开放式生成中缺乏控制，导致描述符基数大、性能低，给下游模型带来挑战。

Conclusion: AgenticTagger通过引入词汇构建和分配阶段，并采用多智能体反思机制，有效解决了LLM在物品描述符生成中的开放式生成问题，显著提升了描述符的质量和下游推荐任务的性能。

Abstract: High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了Causal Analyst框架，通过将LLM与数据驱动的因果发现相结合，来识别和利用导致大语言模型（LLM）越狱的直接原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM越狱的机制对于提升其安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究主要关注潜在表征的探测，忽略了可解释提示特征与越狱发生之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出Causal Analyst框架，整合LLM进行数据驱动的因果发现。构建包含35k越狱尝试的数据集，并利用基于GNN的因果图学习来重构提示特征与越狱响应之间的因果路径。

Result: 研究发现“Positive Character”和“Number of Task Steps”等特征是越狱的直接因果驱动因素。利用这些见解开发了“Jailbreaking Enhancer”和“Guardrail Advisor”，前者显著提高了攻击成功率，后者则能从混淆查询中提取真实恶意意图。

Conclusion: 从因果角度分析越狱特征是提高LLM可靠性的一种有效且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

### [110] [Momentum Attention: The Physics of In-Context Learning and Spectral Forensics for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04902)
*Kingsuk Maitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper models Transformers as physical circuits with conservation laws and AC dynamics, introducing Momentum Attention with a symplectic augmentation ($p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, $\hat{q}_t = q_t + ased{gamma}p_t$). A key finding is the Symplectic-Filter Duality, equating physical shear to a High-Pass Filter, which bypasses the need for two layers to form induction heads by providing direct access to velocity. This enables Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics. An Orthogonality Theorem is proven, showing DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands due to the interaction between Low-Pass RoPE and High-Pass Momentum. A 125M Momentum model performed well on induction-heavy tasks, outperforming expectations and staying close to a 350M baseline. An associative recall experiment revealed a scaling law ($γ^* = 4.17 	imes N^{-0.74}$) for momentum-depth fungibility. The framework connects Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the mechanistic interpretability of Transformers by viewing them as physical circuits, incorporating conservation laws and time-varying dynamics, and to enable more efficient learning of causal relationships through bypassing topological depth constraints.

Method: The paper augments the Transformer graph with a conservation law and AC dynamics, introducing Momentum Attention which uses a symplectic augmentation with the kinematic difference operator ($p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$) and symplectic shear ($\hat{q}_t = q_t + ased{gamma}p_t$) on queries and keys. It establishes a Symplectic-Filter Duality, equating physical shear to a High-Pass Filter, enabling Single-Layer Induction. An Orthogonality Theorem is formalized to demonstrate the segregation of DC and AC signals. Experiments were conducted on a 125M Momentum model and compared to a 350M baseline, with associative recall experiments used to derive a scaling law.

Result: The 125M Momentum model exceeded expectations on induction-heavy tasks, maintaining a validation loss within 2.9% of a 350M baseline. The Symplectic-Filter Duality was shown to enable Single-Layer Induction, and Spectral Forensics were achieved via Bode Plots. The Orthogonality Theorem was proven, demonstrating signal segregation. A scaling law ($γ^* = 4.17 	imes N^{-0.74}$) for momentum-depth fungibility was discovered.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, integrating physical circuit concepts, Momentum Attention, and the Symplectic-Filter Duality, provides a powerful analytical toolkit for understanding Transformers. It enables more efficient learning by bypassing depth constraints, offers new methods for analysis like Spectral Forensics, and establishes connections between AI, physics, and signal processing.

Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.

Motivation: To understand the practical effectiveness and potential trade-offs of feature steering methods in controlling LLM behavior, particularly regarding output quality.

Method: Evaluated Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines on 14 steering queries across 171 MMLU questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B models. Measured accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control.

Result: Auto Steer successfully modified target behaviors but caused dramatic performance degradation: accuracy dropped from 66% to 46% (Llama-8B) and 87% to 73% (Llama-70B), with coherence falling significantly as well. Simple prompting offered the best overall balance.

Conclusion: Current feature steering methods have limitations for practical deployment due to significant capability-behavior trade-offs. Mechanistic control methods require empirical characterization of these trade-offs before deployment.

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

*Yiwen Wang,Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCER框架通过双阶段压缩和基于能量的重建来解决多模态融合中的噪声输入和模态缺失问题，并在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在面对噪声输入导致表示质量下降和模态缺失导致预测失败这两个鲁棒性挑战时，需要一个统一的框架来解决。

Method: DCER框架包含两个阶段：1. 压缩阶段：在模态内进行频率变换（音频使用小波变换，视频使用DCT）以去除噪声并保留任务相关模式；跨模态引入瓶颈令牌以强制进行真正的模态融合，而非模态特定的捷径。2. 重建阶段：对于缺失的模态，通过在学习到的能量函数上进行梯度下降来恢复表示，最终的能量值可以提供内在的不确定性量化（与预测误差>0.72的相关性）。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS数据集上实现了最先进的性能。观察到一种U型鲁棒性模式，在完整和高缺失条件下都倾向于多模态融合。

Conclusion: DCER框架成功地解决了多模态融合中的噪声输入和模态缺失问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了领先性能，同时提供了不确定性量化。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

*Chika Maduabuchi,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Continuous-time generative models suffer from high variance and inefficiency due to independent timestep training. Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC) is introduced as a variance-reduction technique that couples predictions at paired timesteps, improving sample quality and efficiency without altering the model, path, or solver. TPC theoretically offers quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization, reducing gradient variance while maintaining the flow-matching objective. It demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to existing methods and integrates well with advanced pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time generative models are trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, resulting in high estimator variance and inefficient sampling.

Method: Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC) is a variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path. It operates at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. A theoretical analysis shows TPC induces quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization, reducing gradient variance while preserving the flow-matching objective.

Result: TPC, when applied to flow matching, improves sample quality and efficiency on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at various resolutions. It achieves lower FID scores at comparable or reduced computational costs compared to previous methods. TPC also extends to SOTA-style pipelines including noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

Conclusion: Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC) is an effective and efficient variance-reduction technique for continuous-time generative models. It enhances sample quality and reduces computational cost by coupling predictions at paired timesteps, offering theoretical guarantees and broad applicability to various advanced generative modeling pipelines.

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPO等方法通过正则化更新来约束语言模型，但静态参考策略可能导致分布不匹配和虚假信号的放大。GAPO提出了一种动态的、几何感知的锚点，即在小半径内对当前策略进行对抗性局部扰动，以作为悲观基线。这种锚点通过自适应重加权机制，根据局部敏感度调节每个偏好对的重要性。GAPO还引入了锚点差距，即策略与其锚点之间的奖励差异，并证明该差距可以近似最坏情况下的局部裕度下降。通过优化由该差距加权的逻辑目标，GAPO可以降低几何上脆弱的实例的重要性，同时强调鲁棒的偏好信号。在各种噪声设置下，GAPO在标准LLM对齐和推理基准测试中表现出一致的鲁棒性提升，并能匹配或超越现有方法。

Motivation: 静态参考策略在DPO等方法中可能导致分布不匹配和虚假信号放大，而无参考方法可能面临奖励漂移问题。需要一种能够适应策略漂移并处理噪声监督的方法。

Method: 提出几何锚点偏好优化（GAPO），使用动态的、几何感知的锚点（当前策略的小半径对抗性局部扰动）代替固定参考策略。引入锚点差距（策略与锚点的奖励差异），并使用其对逻辑目标进行加权，以自适应地调整每个偏好对的重要性，降低脆弱实例的权重，强调鲁棒信号。

Conclusion: GAPO通过引入动态锚点和锚点差距，有效地解决了DPO等方法中静态参考策略带来的问题，提高了语言模型对齐的鲁棒性，并能在标准基准测试中取得良好的性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

Motivation: 提出一种新的线性时间注意力机制，以克服标准softmax注意力的二次计算复杂度，同时保持接近标准注意力的性能。

Method: 1. 基于E-Product（Yat-kernel）提出一种新的注意力机制。2. 将查询和键约束在单位球面上，使注意力计算仅依赖于角度对齐。3. 利用Bernstein定理将球形Yat-kernel表示为多项式-指数乘积核的非负混合。4. 导出严格正随机特征近似，实现线性时间O(L)注意力。5. 证明了该方法在球上的正定性和有界性。6. 实验验证了其性能和效率。

Conclusion: SLAY是一种有效的线性时间注意力机制，它在保持Transformer模型性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率和可扩展性，克服了传统softmax注意力的瓶颈。

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

### [120] [Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918)
*Long Zhang,Fangwei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often comply with conflicting in-context information, overriding their pre-trained knowledge. This paper investigates the mechanism behind this 'sycophancy' by analyzing the geometric changes in the model's residual stream across different LLMs (Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, GLM-4-9B). The study found that instead of simply diluting the 'truth,' conflicting information 'steers' the model's representations through quasi-orthogonal interference, effectively rotating the hidden state. This suggests that LLMs simulate adoption of new information by geometrically displacing their internal representations, rather than truly unlearning or suppressing existing knowledge. The findings highlight the limitations of scalar confidence measures for detecting model hallucinations and emphasize the need for vectorial monitoring to differentiate between genuine knowledge integration and superficial mimicry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the underlying mechanism of how Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit sycophancy or compliance, specifically how they resolve conflicts between in-context information and pre-existing knowledge, and whether this involves signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration in the residual stream.

Method: The study employed a layer-wise geometric analysis across three LLM architectures (Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B). They decomposed the residual stream updates, which were induced by counter-factual contexts, into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components to analyze the geometric changes.

Result: The empirical results rejected the 'Manifold Dilution' hypothesis, as two of the three architectures showed stable residual norms despite performance degradation. The study consistently observed 'Orthogonal Interference,' where conflicting context introduces a steering vector nearly orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, rotating the hidden state representation. This indicates that models simulate adopting new information via geometric displacement rather than suppressing or unlearning existing knowledge.

Conclusion: Compliance in LLMs is characterized by 'Orthogonal Interference,' a geometric steering mechanism that displaces the hidden state representation rather than diluting the magnitude of pre-existing knowledge. This challenges the use of scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and highlights the importance of vectorial monitoring to distinguish true knowledge integration from in-context mimicry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

Motivation: 为了减少大语言模型（LLMs）的资源消耗和加速推理，需要在不影响性能的情况下消除冗余参数，但传统剪枝方法会导致性能显著下降，并需要大量训练后调整。

Method: 提出一种多阶段的、细粒度的渐进式压缩方法（PTL），在每个阶段应用剪枝-微调循环，逐步减小模型尺寸并恢复性能。

Conclusion: PTL是一种有效的模型压缩方法，通过渐进式压缩和微调，能在显著降低模型尺寸的同时保持甚至提升其在多种推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为循环信息学习（CyIN）的新型框架，用于解决真实世界中不完整多模态学习的性能下降问题。该框架通过信息瓶颈（IB）技术构建信息潜在空间，并利用跨模态循环翻译来补充缺失模态，从而在完整和不完整的多模态场景下都能实现优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数多模态模型在训练时需要完美的成对输入，但在实际应用中，模态的可变性和不可预测性会导致模型性能显著下降，无法在动态缺失模态的情况下保持鲁棒性。

Method: 首先，通过在各种模态之间循环采用 token 和 label 级别的信息瓶颈（IB）来构建一个信息潜在空间。然后，通过变分近似捕获与任务相关的特征，对信息瓶颈潜在空间进行提纯，以实现更有效的跨模态交互和多模态融合。其次，为了补充由不完整多模态输入引起的缺失信息，提出了跨模态循环翻译，通过前向和反向传播过程，利用剩余模态重建缺失的模态。最后，通过提取和重建的信息潜在空间，CyIN 成功地在一个统一的模型中联合优化完整和不完整的多模态学习。

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了可靠的视听问答（R-AVQA）形式化问题，强调在不确定时选择弃权而非错误回答。研究引入了自适应置信度精炼（ACR）方法，通过预测和校正最大Softmax概率（MSP）的不足之处来提高模型的可靠性，并在多个AVQA架构上进行了实验验证，证明了ACR在不同设置下的优越性。

Motivation: 现有视听问答（AVQA）模型虽然准确率高，但在识别自身错误并选择弃权方面的能力仍有待探索。本研究旨在解决这一问题，提出一种能在不确定时选择弃权而非错误回答的可靠视听问答（R-AVQA）形式化问题。

Method: 提出自适应置信度精炼（ACR）方法，该方法在维持最大Softmax概率（MSP）作为主要置信度信号的同时，在MSP不可靠时应用输入自适应的残差校正。ACR包含两个学习头：残差风险头（预测MSP未捕捉到的低幅度正确性残差）和置信度门控头（判断MSP的可靠性）。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，ACR在三个不同的AVQA架构上，于 in-distribution、out-of-distribution 和数据偏倚设置下，均持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ACR是一种轻量级的方法，能够有效提升R-AVQA的性能，为R-AVQA任务奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

TL;DR: STIR通过动态潜在轨迹控制，将链式思考过程内化到隐藏状态，提升了模型在推理任务上的准确性并减少了计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法依赖于静态控制向量，无法适应复杂推理任务中非平稳的演化。

Method: STIR框架将推理增强重新表述为动态潜在轨迹控制问题，包含三个阶段：1. 差分内在动作归纳；2. 稀疏控制基构建；3. 值调制轨迹干预。

Result: 在六个算术和逻辑基准测试中，STIR相比传统解码方法，平均准确率提高了1.9%到7.5%，同时平均词元消耗减少了高达35%。

Conclusion: STIR证明了显式链式思考的好处可以通过动态潜在轨迹控制实现，内化推理过程以绕过显式生成，同时实现卓越的保真度。

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

### [125] [CSRv2: Unlocking Ultra-Sparse Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05735)
*Lixuan Guo,Yifei Wang,Tiansheng Wen,Yifan Wang,Aosong Feng,Bo Chen,Stefanie Jegelka,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSRv2 addresses the performance degradation of ultra-sparse embeddings in the Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) method by introducing a stable training approach with progressive k-annealing and supervised contrastive objectives. This results in significantly reduced dead neurons and improved accuracy, making ultra-sparse embeddings comparable to denser methods while offering substantial efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the severe performance degradation of Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) in the ultra-sparse regime (over 80% inactive neurons), which limits its efficiency potential, and to make ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance.

Method: CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning using progressive k-annealing, enhances representation quality with supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability through full backbone finetuning.

Result: CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20%, achieving a 14% accuracy gain at k=2. It matches CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions in performance, while offering a 7x speedup over MRL and significant compute/memory efficiency improvements over dense embeddings. Across text and vision tasks, CSRv2 shows improvements over CSR, especially at smaller k values.

Conclusion: CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical and viable by mitigating performance degradation, thereby expanding the design space for efficient AI systems in real-time and edge computing scenarios.

Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TurboBoA是一种新的无反向传播后训练量化（PTQ）算法，它通过联合量化多个输出通道、引入层间误差校正以及自适应网格计算，在保持BoA精度的同时显著提高了量化效率，并在特定条件下达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法（如GPTQ）在低比特量化时存在精度下降问题，而BoA虽然解决了层间依赖性问题，但效率较低。因此，需要一种既能保持高精度又能提高效率的PTQ算法。

Method: TurboBoA通过以下三个创新点进行改进：1. 联合量化多个输出通道，并使用闭式误差补偿规则，减少了顺序瓶颈，实现了三倍以上的加速。2. 引入了针对先前量化层传播错误的校正机制。3. 采用自适应网格计算和坐标下降细化来保持迭代更新过程中的对齐。

Result: TurboBoA在实验中证明了其显著的加速效果和持续的精度提升，优于BoA。当结合异常值抑制技术时，TurboBoA在仅量化权重和量化权重-激活方面均取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: TurboBoA是一种高效且准确的PTQ算法，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实际应用中展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. The code will be available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/TurboBoA.

TL;DR: Decoder-only LLMs transition from context processing to prediction with depth, organizing representations geometrically to control token prediction. Angular organization relates to prediction similarity, while norms encode context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational dynamics of decoder-only LLMs in transforming context into predictions, specifically how representational geometry changes with depth and influences prediction.

Method: Combined geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention to analyze representational geometry and control token prediction in LLMs.

Result: Identified a depth-wise transition in LLMs from context-processing to prediction-forming phases. Found that late-layer representations have a structured geometric code where angular organization parametrizes prediction distributional similarity and representation norms encode context-specific, non-predictive information.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit a mechanistic-geometric account of transforming context into predictions, characterized by a depth-wise representational reorganization that enables causal control over token prediction.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

TL;DR: HC-GCD在洛伦兹双曲模型中学习嵌入，并使用双曲K-Means算法直接在双曲空间中进行聚类，在GCD任务上达到了与现有方法相当的性能，同时提高了聚类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双曲GCD方法仅在表示学习中使用双曲几何，而在聚类时转换回欧氏几何，这可能不是最优的。

Method: 提出HC-GCD模型，在洛伦兹双曲模型中学习嵌入，并使用双曲K-Means算法直接在双曲空间中进行聚类。

Result: HC-GCD在Semantic Shift Benchmark数据集上与现有的最先进的双曲GCD方法相当。使用双曲K-Means比欧氏K-Means具有更高的准确性。范数裁剪会降低未见类的准确性，增加已见类的准确性，整体准确性取决于数据集。双曲K-Means在改变标签粒度时能产生更一致的聚类。

Conclusion: HC-GCD在GCD任务中，通过在双曲空间中进行表示学习和聚类，能够取得与现有方法相当的性能，并且在聚类准确性和一致性方面优于欧氏方法。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用训练时特权信息（PI）可以增强语言模型在困难、长时域任务中的表现，但将其迁移到推理时无PI的策略是一个关键挑战。本文提出了π-Distill和On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD)两种方法，用于从仅有动作信息的PI中蒸馏出前沿智能体，并在多个基准测试中优于标准的监督微调+强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多轮智能体环境中，由于封闭源代码系统通常隐藏内部推理过程，只暴露动作轨迹，这使得从具有特权信息（PI）的教师模型中蒸馏出在推理时没有PI的学生模型成为一个关键挑战。PI是一种强大的工具，可以在强化学习中解决困难、长时域的问题。

Method: 本文提出了两种方法：1. π-Distill：一个联合教师-学生目标函数，同时使用相同的模型训练一个PI条件化的教师和一个无条件的学生。2. On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD)：一种替代方法，使用强化学习进行训练，并在学生和PI条件化的教师之间引入反向KL惩罚。

Result: π-Distill 和 OPSD（在某些情况下）能够有效地从仅有动作信息的PI中蒸馏出前沿智能体，并且在多个智能体基准测试、模型和PI形式上，其表现优于标准的监督微调（SFT）+强化学习（RL）方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的π-Distill和OPSD算法能够有效地将具有特权信息（PI）的智能体能力迁移到没有PI的推理环境中，并在多项基准测试中超越了现有的行业标准方法。文章还对影响PI有效学习的因素进行了深入分析，并明确了OPSD具有竞争力的条件。

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

Method: 提出了一种随机分层优化框架，该框架利用“邋遢模型”理论和简化的Hessian近似来识别关键参数子空间。该框架与一个基于数据的概率公式相结合，以生成目标损失函数。

Result: 该框架在等离子体-表面相互作用问题上得到了验证，并显示出比传统优化方法更高的样本效率。通过识别最能影响模型输出的参数子集，可以显著减少所需的模拟查询次数。

Conclusion: 所提出的随机分层优化框架为高效校准复杂物理模型提供了一种通用且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于计算成本高昂且参数空间具有挑战性的情况。

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

TL;DR: Online matching algorithms using a coarsening approach with capacitated clusters offer near-optimal theoretical guarantees and perform well in realistic simulations for heart transplant allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical algorithms used in online matching for domains like internet advertising and organ allocation often lack strong theoretical guarantees. This paper aims to address this gap by developing new online matching algorithms with improved theoretical backing.

Method: The paper develops new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. This involves aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters, which, contrary to typical expectations of granularity loss, is shown to yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. The methodology is applied to heart transplant allocation using structural properties of historical data.

Result: The developed policy, based on the coarsening methodology and applied to heart transplant allocation, closely matches the performance of an omniscient benchmark in realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and theoretical lower bounds by providing a rigorous justification for clustering-based approaches in organ allocation and developing theoretically grounded policies for heart transplant allocation that perform near-optimally.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current organ allocation algorithms are moving towards data-driven optimization but overlook the critical role of incentives, leading to adverse consequences.

Method: Analyzed US adult heart transplant allocation, identifying incentive misalignments and their negative impacts. Proposes integrating mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice into future allocation policies.

Result: Identified critical incentive misalignments in US adult heart transplant allocation with adverse consequences. Proposed a research agenda for machine learning community.

Conclusion: Future organ allocation policies must be incentive-aware to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness, requiring an interdisciplinary approach combining AI and game theory.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

Motivation: 评估 LoRA 变体在不同超参数下的性能，特别是学习率的影响，并与 vanilla LoRA 进行比较，以确定是否存在持续的方法优势。

Method: 对四种代表性的 LoRA 变体和 vanilla LoRA 进行广泛的超参数搜索，特别关注学习率。通过二阶分析将最优学习率范围与最大 Hessian 特征值联系起来。

Result: 在数学和代码生成任务以及不同模型规模上，所有 LoRA 方法在经过适当的学习率调整后，均能达到相似的峰值性能（1-2% 的差异），表明 vanilla LoRA 仍然是一个有竞争力的基线。不同 LoRA 方法的最优学习率范围存在差异，这与最大 Hessian 特征值相关。

Conclusion: LoRA 变体在超参数选择上可能表现出不同的偏好，但 vanilla LoRA 在经过仔细调整后仍然是一个强大的基准。先前研究中报告的改进可能并非源于方法本身的优势，而是在特定超参数设置下偶然实现的。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

Motivation: 为离散扩散语言模型设计一种有效且可靠的奖励引导方法，以解决现有技术中梯度计算的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为EntRGi（熵感知奖励引导）的新机制，该机制通过根据模型置信度动态调节连续松弛来调制来自奖励模型的梯度，从而克服了离散输出的限制。

Result: 在7B参数的扩散语言模型上，针对3个不同的奖励模型和3个多技能基准进行了实证验证，结果显示在奖励引导方面取得了持续的改进，优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: EntRGi是一种有效的奖励引导方法，通过熵感知机制克服了离散扩散语言模型的梯度计算挑战，并在各种任务中实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 新提出的基于专家积模型的私有ICL方法在准确性和隐私保护方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

TL;DR: 通过基于控制理论的框架ControlG，实现了多任务图自监督学习的目标协调，解决了传统方法中的目标冲突和训练不稳问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图自监督学习（SSL）的多种预训练目标（如互信息、重构、对比学习）的有效结合面临目标干扰和训练不稳定的挑战，现有方法通常采用每更新一次就进行权重混合，导致不同目标间的冲突、目标效用变化不定以及部分目标被忽视等问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为ControlG的控制理论框架，将多目标图SSL视为通过反馈控制进行的时间分配问题。该框架通过估计各目标难度和成对拮抗关系，利用帕累托感知对数超体积规划器规划目标预算，并使用比例-积分-微分（PID）控制器进行调度。

Result: 在9个数据集上，ControlG的性能持续优于最先进的基线方法，并且能够生成可审计的调度，揭示了哪些目标在学习过程中起到了关键作用。

Conclusion: ControlG通过将多目标图SSL视为一个时间分配问题，并采用控制理论的方法进行协调，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实验中证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

TL;DR: ReFORM是一种基于流策略的离线强化学习方法，通过强制执行约束来避免分布外（OOD）错误，并能保留策略的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习（RL）面临的主要挑战是分布外（OOD）错误，即当策略偏离训练分布时出现的问题，以及最优策略分布可能具有多模态且难以表示的问题。

Method: ReFORM首先学习一个具有有界源分布的行为克隆（BC）流策略来捕捉动作分布的支持，然后优化一个反射流，该流为BC流生成有界噪声，同时保持其支持，以最大化性能。

Result: 在OGBench基准的40个具有挑战性的任务中，ReFORM在不同质量的数据集上，并使用恒定的超参数，其性能优于所有具有手动调整超参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: ReFORM通过强制执行约束来解决离线RL中的OOD错误问题，并能保留策略的表达能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

TL;DR: a hybrid predictive framework recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions using CV and RWIS data, QRF, and physics-based constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reduced driver visibility and tire-road surface friction caused by inclement weather, which necessitates adjusted safe driving speeds to mitigate crash risks.

Method: A hybrid predictive framework was developed, utilizing Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions from 26 input features (meteorological, pavement, temporal). A physics-based upper speed limit was calculated for real-time safety, considering road grip and visibility. The final recommended interval integrated QRF quantiles, posted speed limits, and the physics-derived upper bound.

Result: The QRF model demonstrated strong predictive performance with a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph and 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph. The prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) at 50% was 48.55%, showing robust generalization across different weather conditions.

Conclusion: The developed model shows promise for real-world deployment due to its ability to adapt to changing weather and generalize across road segments, aiming to enhance traffic safety and decrease weather-related accidents.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of computing exact gradients in combinatorial problems, which typically involve optimization over a hypercube and require multiple queries. The goal is to develop a more efficient gradient computation method.

Method: The paper proposes a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method is shown to encompass the REINFORCE algorithm (via importance sampling) and introduces a novel class of stochastic gradients.

Result: The proposed stochastic gradient is unbiased and requires only a single query, making gradient computation more efficient. It includes existing methods like REINFORCE and offers new approaches.

Conclusion: The paper presents a new class of single-query, unbiased stochastic gradients for probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

TL;DR: We propose RRD, a framework for refining rubrics used to guide LLM judges, by recursively decomposing and filtering criteria. RRD improves rubric quality, leading to better LLM judge accuracy and more effective reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rubrics used to guide LLM judges for subjective preferences often suffer from poor coverage, conflated dimensions, misaligned preference direction, and redundancy, which degrades judge accuracy and leads to suboptimal rewards during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).

Method: RRD employs a recursive decompose-filter cycle. It decomposes coarse rubrics into finer-grained, discriminative criteria to enhance coverage and separation. A filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant criteria, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representation of highly correlated criteria.

Result: RRD significantly improves LLM judge accuracy on benchmarks like JudgeBench and PPE for models such as GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B, achieving top performance. When used for RFT on WildChat, RRD substantially boosts reward signals compared to prior rubric baselines, with gains transferring to other benchmarks like HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench.

Conclusion: RRD provides a principled and effective framework for recursive rubric refinement, establishing it as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

Conclusion: SemPipes通过LLM驱动的语义算子，能够有效优化表格ML管道，提升预测性能并简化管道设计。

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdamW的权重衰减并非最优，存在


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW虽然将权重衰减与自适应梯度缩放分开了，但仍然存在根本性的冲突：径向拉锯战。在深度学习中，梯度倾向于增加参数范数以扩展有效容量，同时又引导方向以学习特征，而权重衰减则不加区分地抑制范数增长。这种推拉交互会导致径向振荡，向Adam的二阶矩估计注入噪声，并可能损害精细的切向特征学习。

Method: 我们提出正交动力学解耦，并将其实例化为AdamO：一种类似SGD的更新处理一维范数控制，而Adam的自适应预处理则被限制在切向子空间。AdamO进一步结合了曲率自适应径向步长调整和面向架构的规则以及用于尺度不变层和低维参数的投影。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，AdamO在不引入额外复杂约束的情况下，提高了泛化能力和稳定性，优于AdamW。

Conclusion: AdamO通过将范数控制和特征学习解耦，解决了AdamW中的径向拉锯战问题，并在实践中提高了模型的泛化能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

### [151] [Fairness Under Group-Conditional Prior Probability Shift: Invariance, Drift, and Target-Aware Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05144)
*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在部署环境中，历史数据的机器学习模型在公平性方面表现不佳，因为环境条件发生了变化。特别是，当不同人口统计组的阳性结果患病率变化不同时，会发生普遍的模式转变。我们研究了分组条件先验概率转移（GPPS），其中标签患病率P（Y=1 | A = a）在训练和部署之间可能发生变化，但特征生成过程P（X | Y，A）保持不变。我们的分析得出了三个主要贡献。首先，我们证明了一个基本的不等式：基于错误率（均等赔率）的公平性标准在GPPS下是结构不变的，而接受率标准（人口均等）可能会漂移，并且对于非平凡分类器（抗偏移不可能性），这种漂移是不可避免的。其次，我们证明了目标域风险和公平性指标在没有目标标签的情况下是可识别的：ROC数量在GPPS下的不变性使得仅使用源标签和未标记的目标数据进行一致估计成为可能，并具有有限样本保证。第三，我们提出了一种名为TAP-GPPS的无标签后处理算法，该算法从无标签数据中估计患病率，校正后验概率，并选择阈值以在目标域中满足人口均等。实验验证了我们的理论预测，并表明TAP-GPPS在效用损失最小的情况下实现了目标公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习模型部署后，环境条件可能会发生变化，特别是标签的先验概率在不同群体中会发生变化，这会影响公平性指标。研究GPPS的目的是理解这种变化对公平性的影响，并提出解决方案。

Method: 1. 证明了公平性标准（如均等赔率和人口均等）在GPPS下的理论不变性或易变性。2. 提出了在无标签目标数据下，仅通过源标签和未标记的目标数据识别目标域风险和公平性指标的方法。3. 开发了一种名为TAP-GPPS的无标签后处理算法，用于在目标域中实现人口均等。

Result: 1. 证明了均等赔率在GPPS下是不变的，而人口均等会漂移，并且这种漂移是不可避免的。2. 证明了目标域风险和公平性指标是可识别的，并且可以从源标签和未标记的目标数据中进行估计。3. TAP-GPPS算法在目标域中实现了人口均等，并且只造成了最小的效用损失。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了GPPS对公平性指标的影响，提出了在无标签目标数据下进行公平性评估和调整的方法，并开发了TAP-GPPS算法以在目标域中实现公平性，同时最小化效用损失。这对于在动态变化的环境中部署公平的机器学习系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

### [152] [TIDE: Temporal Incremental Draft Engine for Self-Improving LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05145)
*Jiyoung Park,Hankyu Jang,Changseok Song,Wookeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Speculative decoding for LLMs is hard to implement due to changing workloads and system limits. TIDE is a new framework that adapts draft models online within inference systems. It uses hidden states from inference as training signals, avoiding model reloading and extra costs. TIDE also uses runtime control to only speculate and train when useful and utilizes heterogeneous clusters for inference and training. TIDE improves throughput by up to 1.15x and reduces draft training time by 1.67x compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realizing the benefits of speculative decoding for LLM inference in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints.

Method: TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine) is a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation into LLM inference systems. It reuses target model hidden states as training signals for zero-overhead draft adaptation and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE also utilizes heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes.

Result: TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding and reduces draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals, across diverse real-world workloads.

Conclusion: TIDE is an effective framework for accelerating LLM inference through online draft adaptation integrated into high-performance systems, outperforming static speculative decoding and reducing training overhead.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoSA是一种基于压缩传感理论的新型参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，它通过固定随机投影矩阵和紧凑的可学习核心来表达权重更新，克服了低秩假设的局限性，并在多种任务和模型上实现了与现有最先进PEFT方法相当或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA、PiSSA）依赖低秩分解，可能因低秩假设限制了模型在特定任务适应中的表达能力，尤其是在奇异值分布较均匀的情况下。

Method: CoSA基于压缩传感理论，不强制权重更新处于低秩子空间，而是利用固定的随机投影矩阵和紧凑的可学习核心来表达权重更新，并从理论上证明了权重更新可以被压缩编码到低维空间并通过随机投影映射回。

Result: 在10个自然语言理解和生成任务上，使用RoBERTa、Llama、Qwen等5种不同规模的模型进行的大量实验表明，CoSA在所有设置下都能匹配或超越现有的最先进PEFT方法，提供了多尺度模型高效适应的原则性视角。

Conclusion: CoSA通过引入压缩传感理论，提供了一种比低秩分解更具表达力的PEFT方法，能够有效且高效地进行多尺度模型适应，并在广泛的任务和模型上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

### [154] [Position: Capability Control Should be a Separate Goal From Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05164)
*Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui,Eleni Triantafillou,David Krueger,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models' broad capabilities pose risks of misuse. This paper proposes capability control, distinct from alignment, to impose hard limits on model behavior. It outlines a three-layered approach (data, learning, system) for capability control across the model lifecycle and advocates for a defense-in-depth strategy, highlighting challenges like dual-use knowledge and compositional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The broad capabilities of foundation models, while enabling many applications, also increase the potential for misuse and failures. Therefore, capability control, defined as imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior, should be a distinct goal from alignment.

Method: The paper organizes capability control mechanisms into three layers across the model lifecycle: 1) data-based control of the training distribution, 2) learning-based control through weight- or representation-level interventions, and 3) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails on inputs, outputs, and actions. It advocates for a defense-in-depth approach that combines complementary controls.

Result: The paper outlines a layered framework for capability control and identifies key open challenges, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization, suggesting that a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary due to the characteristic failure modes of each control layer when used in isolation.

Conclusion: To effectively manage the risks associated with foundation models, capability control should be pursued as a distinct goal from alignment. A defense-in-depth approach, integrating controls across the data, learning, and system layers throughout the model lifecycle, is recommended to mitigate the inherent failure modes of isolated controls. Addressing challenges such as dual-use knowledge and compositional generalization is crucial for achieving robust capability control.

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

TL;DR: RLVR通过GRPO增强LLM推理能力，但GRPO在计算约束和饱和失败模式下存在稳定性问题。EBPO通过经验贝叶斯方法，利用全局统计信息正则化局部基线，解决了这些问题，并在理论和实践中均优于GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法，特别是GRPO，在增强LLM推理能力方面存在稳定性挑战，包括在计算约束下估计方差大和在饱和失败模式下梯度信号消失。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的框架EBPO，通过经验贝叶斯方法，利用全局统计信息正则化局部基于组的基线。EBPO使用收缩估计器，通过Welford在线算法动态地平衡局部组统计信息和一个通过Welford在线算法更新的全局先验。

Result: 理论上，EBPO保证比GRPO具有更低的均方误差（MSE），有界的熵衰减，以及在失败场景下非消失的惩罚信号。经验上，EBPO在AIME和OlympiadBench等基准测试中持续优于GRPO和其他基线方法，表现出更优的训练稳定性，即使在小组规模较小的情况下也能实现高性能，并且能从难度分层课程学习中受益。

Conclusion: EBPO通过经验贝叶斯正则化克服了GRPO在RLVR中的稳定性限制，为增强LLM推理能力提供了一个更稳定、更有效的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Motivation: 解决现有季节性模型无法满足日常生态系统管理所需的精细化时间变异性预测问题。

Method: 训练并比较了四种深度学习架构（BiLSTM、Medformer、ST-Transformer、TCN），使用2009-2020年的12年水动力-生物地球化学模型预报数据进行训练，并使用2020-2024年的预报数据进行测试。模型考虑了水体分层、沉积物耗氧和温度依赖的分解速率。

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解在复杂强化学习环境中LLMs训练过程中行为的变化。

Method: 应用预训练的稀疏自编码器（SAEs）和LLM-summarizer方法，并提出Meta-Autointerp方法将SAE特征分组为关于训练动态的可解释假设。

Result: 发现了包括角色扮演模式、退化输出、语言切换、高层策略行为和特定环境bug在内的细粒度行为。90%的SAE元特征被验证具有显著性，并发现了一种意外的奖励函数破解行为。用户研究表明，部分SAE特征和LLM生成的假设对人类来说可能无效，但一部分SAE衍生的假设在下游任务中具有预测价值。通过增强未训练Agent的系统提示，分数提升了+14.2%。

Conclusion: SAEs和LLM-summarizer提供了关于Agent行为的互补视角，共同构成了一个实际的起点，用于未来以数据为中心的解释性工作，以确保LLM在整个训练过程中的可信行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

TL;DR: SpectraKAN是一种新的神经算子，通过将输入本身作为条件来改进傅立叶神经算子（FNO），从而实现对多尺度、状态依赖和各向异性动力学的适应性建模，并在各种偏微分方程（PDE）基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的谱算子（如FNO）使用静态的傅立叶核，无法捕捉由系统全局状态控制的多尺度、依赖于状态和各向异性动力学。

Method: SpectraKAN通过从时空历史中提取紧凑的全局表示，并使用它通过单查询交叉注意力来调制多尺度傅立叶主干，从而将静态谱卷积变为输入条件积分算子。KAN提供了平滑的、受 Lipschitz 控制的全局调制。

Result: SpectraKAN在各种PDE基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，在最具挑战性的时空预测任务上，RMSE降低了高达49%，超过了强大的基线。

Conclusion: SpectraKAN通过将谱算子与输入条件相结合，能够适应性地学习复杂的PDE动力学，并在各种基准测试中展现出优越的性能和效率。

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 固定预算稀疏注意力无法适应异构注意力分布，而 top-p 稀疏注意力虽然能更好地保留注意力质量，但现有方法未能联合优化 top-p 精度、选择开销和稀疏注意力成本。本文提出的 Double-P 框架通过在集群级别进行带权重质心估计，然后进行第二次 token 级别的 top-p 细化，联合优化了这三个阶段，在长上下文基准测试中，Double-P 实现了近乎零的精度下降，并将注意力计算开销降低了 1.8 倍，端到端解码速度提高了 1.3 倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理已成为大型语言模型（LLMs）的核心，但日益增长的关键值缓存上的注意力成为解码瓶颈，因此需要稀疏注意力来实现可扩展推理。

Method: Double-P 是一种分层稀疏注意力框架，首先使用带权重质心在集群级别进行粗粒度的 top-p 估计，然后通过第二个 top-p 阶段自适应地优化计算，仅在需要时分配 token 级别的注意力。

Result: Double-P 在长上下文基准测试中，实现了近乎零的精度下降，将注意力计算开销降低了高达 1.8 倍，并实现了高达 1.3 倍的端到端解码速度提升，优于最先进的固定预算稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: Double-P 通过分层优化 top-p 精度、选择开销和稀疏注意力成本，有效解决了现有 top-p 方法的效率限制，在长上下文推理方面取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

### [162] [Private Prediction via Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05219)
*Chao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new differentially private prediction algorithm that reduces the dependence on the number of queries (T) from the standard sqrt(T) to polylogarithmic in streaming settings. This is achieved by using a reduced number of labeled examples, with the exact number depending on the concept class or the dimensionality of the data and the desired privacy level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of differentially private prediction in streaming settings by reducing the number of labeled examples required, which typically grows with the square root of the number of queries.

Method: The paper develops private predictors that achieve polylogarithmic dependence on the number of queries (T) by using a reduced number of labeled examples. Specific methods are tailored for oblivious online adversaries and adaptive online adversaries, with the latter case focusing on halfspaces over R^d.

Result: For oblivious online adversaries, the algorithm requires ~O(VC(C)^3.5 * log^3.5(T)) labeled examples. For adaptive online adversaries and halfspaces over R^d, it requires ~O(d^5.5 * log T) labeled examples.

Conclusion: The paper successfully reduces the number of labeled examples needed for differentially private prediction in streaming settings, offering significant efficiency gains compared to standard composition methods, especially for a large number of queries.

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

*Jiecheng Lu,Xu Han,Yan Sun,Viresh Pati,Yubin Kim,Siddhartha Somani,Shihao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 线性注意力方法（如ZeroS）通过去除零阶项和重加权残差，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了与标准Softmax注意力相当的性能，同时保持了O(N)的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性注意力方法虽然具有O(N)复杂度，但在性能上通常逊于标准的Softmax注意力。这主要是由两个基本限制造成的：一是仅限于凸组合，只允许加性信息融合；二是统一的累积权重偏差，在长序列中会稀释注意力。

Method: 提出ZeroSum Linear Attention（ZeroS），通过移除常数零阶项1/t并重新加权剩余的零和Softmax残差来解决上述局限性。这种修改产生了数学上稳定的权重，允许正负值，并使单个注意力层能够执行对比操作。

Result: ZeroS在保持O(N)复杂度的同时，理论上扩展了可表示函数的集合，优于凸组合。在各种序列建模基准测试中，其实际性能与标准Softmax注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: ZeroS通过数学上的改进，克服了现有线性注意力方法的关键限制，在保持线性复杂度的同时，实现了与标准Softmax注意力相媲美甚至更优的性能。

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

TL;DR: CDAS是一种新的模型干预方法，通过匹配分布来实现模型控制，避免了传统方法的过度拟合问题，并在特定任务中表现出鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有干预模型的方法（如提示和微调）容易过度拟合，并且有时会产生不自然的输出，因为它们强制执行外部偏好而不是识别内部模型机制。

Method: 提出概念DAS（CDAS）方法，借鉴了分布式对齐搜索（DAS）的原理，特别是分布式交叉干预（DII），但引入了一个新颖的、针对干预任务的分布匹配目标，通过将干预后的输出分布与反事实分布进行匹配来实现。CDAS通过弱监督分布匹配学习干预，并使用支持双向干预的DII，使干预因子可以从数据中导出，从而减少了超参数调整的工作量，实现了更可靠、更稳定的控制。

Result: 在AxBench基准测试中，CDAS在某些情况下不总是优于偏好优化方法，但在模型规模增大时可能受益更多。在两个与安全相关的案例研究中，CDAS成功地覆盖了安全对齐模型的拒绝行为，并中和了链式思考后门，同时保持了模型的通用效用。

Conclusion: CDAS是一种有前景的干预模型方法，与偏好优化方法互补，在特定条件下可作为一种鲁棒的模型干预方案。

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过引入混合门控流（HGF）-一种结合1.58位三元主干和可学习的低秩FP16纠正路径的双流架构-我们克服了LLM在边缘设备部署中的内存瓶颈，同时最大限度地减少了精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在边缘设备上的部署受限于内存带宽的“内存墙”，而现有的1.58位量化技术会带来显著的困惑度下降。

Method: 提出了一种混合门控流（HGF）双流架构，该架构将1.58位三元主干与通过自适应门控控制的可学习低秩FP16纠正路径相结合。

Result: 在TinyStories数据集上，HGF实现了0.9306的验证损失，显著优于BitNet的1.0294，恢复了三元量化和FP16基线之间约55%的质量差距，内存开销仅增加了12-15%。研究还发现，量化作为一种结构正则化有助于提高训练稳定性，并且HGF的性能在更大规模的模型上表现出良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: HGF架构能够有效解决LLM在边缘部署中的内存限制问题，并在保持较低的计算和内存开销的同时，显著恢复因量化而损失的模型质量，同时提高训练稳定性。该方法在大规模模型和实际应用中也展现了良好的扩展潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR methods like GRPO suffer from low-entropy policies and mode collapse due to reinforcing high-likelihood paths. We introduce ARM to re-weight advantages using prompt perplexity and answer confidence, balancing exploration and exploitation. ARM improves diversity and entropy while maintaining accuracy, outperforming GRPO on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models in math and coding tasks, especially in diverse correct reasoning path generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy optimization methods like GRPO in RLVR for LLMs converge to low-entropy policies, causing mode collapse and limiting output diversity by disproportionately reinforcing the highest-likelihood reasoning paths.

Method: Proposed a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) that incorporates Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into advantage estimation to dynamically reshape the reward signal, attenuating gradients for over-confident paths and redistributing probability to under-explored correct solutions.

Result: Empirical results show ARM significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, achieving a better trade-off between exploration and exploitation. On Qwen2.5-7B, ARM improved Pass@1 by 5.7% and Pass@32 by 13.9% compared to GRPO on mathematical and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) effectively mitigates entropy collapse in RLVR for LLMs, improving policy optimization by balancing exploration and exploitation, leading to enhanced diversity and accuracy in generative tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORP是一种闭式一次性结构化剪枝框架，用于Vision Transformer，可在无标签、梯度或微调的情况下，通过将剪枝视为表示恢复问题来移除MLP隐藏维度和注意力子结构，以实现高效的剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Vision Transformer剪枝方法通常需要重新训练或多阶段优化，这限制了模型在训练后部署的能力。本研究旨在提出一种能够在训练后部署的、高效的结构化剪枝方法。

Method: CORP将结构化剪枝构建为表示恢复问题，将移除的激活和注意力logit建模为保留部分的仿射函数，并推导出岭回归的闭式解，将补偿折叠到模型权重中，从而在校准分布下最小化预期的表示误差。

Result: 实验表明，Vision Transformer的MLP和注意力表示中存在大量冗余。未经补偿的一次性结构化剪枝会导致严重的准确率下降。然而，CORP能够在激进稀疏性下保持模型准确率。在DeiT-Huge模型上，CORP在剪枝50%的MLP和注意力结构后，仍能保持82.8%的Top-1准确率。该方法可在单个GPU上20分钟内完成剪枝。

Conclusion: CORP是一种高效、一次性的闭式结构化剪枝框架，适用于Vision Transformer。它能够在无标签、梯度或微调的情况下，通过将剪枝视为表示恢复问题，在严格的训练后约束下实现高效的剪枝，并在不牺牲准确率的情况下显著提高模型效率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Motivation: 传统的后验采样方法在目标位于先验模型低密度区域时，需要对似然性指导进行激进且脆弱的加权，这促使了EmbedOpt方法的提出。

Method: EmbedOpt通过在条件嵌入空间中优化实验似然性来指导扩散模型，该空间能够有效利用序列和协同进化信号，将扩散模型先验与实验约束对齐。

Result: EmbedOpt在模拟冷冻电镜图谱拟合和实验距离约束的两个基准测试中得到验证，其在图谱拟合任务上优于基于坐标的后验采样方法，在距离约束任务上表现相当，并且在跨越两个数量级的超参数中展现出卓越的工程鲁棒性。此外，其平滑的优化行为显著减少了推理所需的扩散步数，提高了效率。

Conclusion: EmbedOpt作为一种替代性的推理时间方法，通过在条件嵌入空间中优化实验似然性，有效地引导扩散模型生成符合实验约束的生物分子构象，在性能、鲁棒性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Conclusion: HealthMamba在医疗机构就诊预测方面优于现有基线方法，能够提供更准确和可靠的预测，并在异常情况下表现更佳。

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 模型合并通过添加多个微调模型的权重更新来将它们合并成一个单一模型，这是一种比重新训练更轻量级的替代方法。现有方法主要针对解决任务更新之间的冲突，但忽略了共享知识被过度计数（over-counting）的失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当任务共享对齐的谱方向（即重叠的奇异向量）时，简单的线性组合会重复累加这些方向，从而膨胀奇异值，并将合并后的模型偏向共享子空间。

Method: 提出了一种名为奇异值校准（SVC）的训练无关、数据无关的后处理方法，该方法量化子空间重叠并重新缩放膨胀的奇异值，以恢复平衡的频谱。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，SVC 持续改进了强大的合并基线，并取得了最先进的性能。此外，通过仅修改奇异值，SVC 使任务算术的性能提高了 13.0%。

Conclusion: SVC 是一种有效的模型合并技术，可以解决共享知识过度计数的问题，并在各种基准测试中提高了性能。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

Motivation: 现有关于SAG、SAGA和IAG等随机方差缩减算法的收敛性分析方法各不相同，且部分算法（如SAG）的原始证明复杂且依赖计算机辅助。本文旨在为这些算法提供一个统一、简洁的分析框架。

Method: 本文采用两种关键步骤：1. 使用简洁的集中不等式工具，建立随机子抽样延迟的上界。2. 设计一种新颖的Lyapunov函数，能够处理这些延迟。

Result: 本文提出了一个统一的收敛性分析，适用于SAG、SAGA和IAG算法。该分析能够推导出SAG和SAGA的首个高概率收敛界限，并且可以轻松扩展到非凸目标函数和马尔可夫抽样。此外，本文利用新的分析技术，为IAG算法获得了已知的最优收敛速率，显著优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 本文成功地为SAG、SAGA和IAG算法提供了一个统一、简洁且模块化的收敛性分析框架，并在此基础上获得了改进的理论界限，为后续研究非凸优化和更一般的抽样方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其效率常因输出冗长而受损。现有的引导方法采用单一的全局向量来修改隐藏表示，这基于线性表示的假设。

Method: FlowSteer通过流匹配（Flow Matching）学习一个完整的非线性变换，将冗长推理的分布映射到简洁推理的分布。该变换被学习为一个速度场，实现了对模型推理过程的精确、依赖于输入的控制。

Conclusion: 通过生成技术对整个分布进行传输，为控制大型推理模型（LRMs）提供了更有效和更合乎原则的基础，能够实现比线性方法更优越的控制效果。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

Result: 在预测、决策和状态估计等多种任务中，Sequential Flow Matching 实现了与全步长扩散模型相媲美的性能，但仅需一次或极少数采样步骤，显著提高了采样速度。

Conclusion: 将序列推理构建为贝叶斯滤波问题，为流模型的高效实时部署提供了一种新的、有原则的视角。

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

Motivation: GRPO及其变体在处理复杂推理任务时存在梯度误分配和梯度支配问题，导致策略更新效率低下且次优。

Method: 将可验证的奖励重新表述为分类标签，而不是标量权重，并将策略优化重新表述为分类问题。引入锚点logits来增强策略学习。

Result: REAL诱导了单调且有界的梯度加权，实现了跨抽样的平衡梯度分配，并有效缓解了梯度不匹配问题。在数学推理基准上的实验表明，REAL提高了训练稳定性，并且在1.5B模型上比DAPO的平均Pass@1高出6.7%，在7B模型上比DAPO和GSPO分别高出6.2%和1.7%。即使使用标准的二元交叉熵，REAL也比DAPO稳定且平均高出4.5%。

Conclusion: REAL框架通过将奖励视为标签，有效地解决了现有强化学习方法的局限性，并在提高大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的性能方面显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSRL中的GM辅助方法面临在子数据集上拼接最优转移和平衡奖励-成本目标的挑战。GAS通过增强数据集、重新标记转移、引入新的目标函数（使用期望回归进行训练）来解决这些问题，从而提高拼接能力并平衡目标，并进一步通过重塑数据集来提高训练稳定性和效率。

Conclusion: GAS通过增强数据集、引入基于期望回归的目标函数和重塑数据集，有效解决了OSRL中GM辅助方法的挑战，并在实践中证明了其在平衡奖励和约束方面的有效性。

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为基于池的主动学习提供了一种新的理论视角，能够统一分析数据选择和学习，并推导出考虑过拟合和归纳偏差差异的理论极限。

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

*Edward Berman,Luisa Li,Jung Yeon Park,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unitary graph convolutions can hurt performance in physical systems like diffusion processes. This paper proposes relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with natural smoothing, outperforming baselines on tasks like weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) for solving PDEs over surfaces suffer from oversmoothing. Unitary graph convolutions, while addressing oversmoothing, may be overconstraining for physical systems with natural smoothing (e.g., diffusion).

Method: The paper systematically studies the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling, proves that unitary convolutions hinder performance in these tasks, and proposes relaxed unitary convolutions. These convolutions are generalized from graphs to meshes, balancing smoothness preservation with natural smoothing required for physical systems.

Result: Experiments on heat and wave equations over complex meshes, and on weather forecasting, show that the proposed relaxed unitary convolutions outperform strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

Conclusion: Relaxed unitary convolutions offer a promising approach for modeling physical systems governed by PDEs, outperforming existing methods by balancing smoothness preservation with the inherent smoothing present in such systems.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

TL;DR: GNN的性能与其聚合信息的邻域范围（跳数）密切相关。现有方法耗时且有偏。我们提出将GNN的消息传递行为建模为随机过程，将跳数视为Beta过程，通过贝叶斯框架同时推断最合适的邻域范围和优化GNN参数。理论分析表明，范围推断提高了GNN的表达能力。实验证明，该方法与现有GNN变体兼容，在节点分类任务上表现优异，并提供校准良好的预测。

Result: 在同质和异质数据集的实验中，该方法与最先进的GNN变体兼容，在节点分类任务上实现了具有竞争性或更优的性能，并提供了校准良好的预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于Beta过程的贝叶斯框架能够自适应地确定GNN的消息聚合范围，提高了GNN的表达能力，并在节点分类任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

TL;DR: DLM-Scope 是首个用于扩散语言模型 (DLM) 的基于稀疏自编码器 (SAE) 的可解释性框架，它能提取可解释特征，并且在某些情况下相比于自回归语言模型 (LLM) 表现出不同的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散语言模型 (DLM) 成为自回归大型语言模型 (LLM) 的有力替代品，开发针对 DLM 的定制化可解释性工具变得至关重要。

Method: 提出并实现了一个名为 DLM-Scope 的 SAE 框架，用于分析 DLM。通过实验比较了 SAE 在 DLM 和 LLM 中的行为差异，并探索了 SAE 在 DLM 解码和后训练阶段的应用。

Result: DLM-Scope 成功提取了 DLM 的可解释特征。发现 SAE 插入 DLM 后，在早期层可以降低交叉熵损失，这在 LLM 中不明显。SAE 特征在 DLM 中支持更有效的干预，优于 LLM 蒸steering。此外，SAE 特征可用于 DLM 解码排序，并且在 DLM 的后训练阶段保持稳定。

Conclusion: DLM-Scope 为 DLM 的机制可解释性奠定了基础，并展示了 SAE 在 DLM 相关任务和算法中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

*Hongyi Li,Han Lin,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Oblique decision trees are powerful but hard to learn. HRT uses non-linear least squares for splits, achieving fast, stable convergence and universal approximation with a good rate, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning high-quality oblique splits for decision trees is NP-hard, and existing methods are slow or use heuristics.

Method: HRT reframes splits as non-linear least-squares problems solved by an alternating fitting procedure equivalent to damped Newton's method. It's analyzed for convergence and shown to be a universal approximator.

Result: HRT matches or outperforms single-tree baselines on synthetic and real-world data, producing more compact trees. Its model class has an $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate.

Conclusion: HRT offers an effective and theoretically sound approach to learning oblique decision trees, providing a balance of transparency and predictive power.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

Motivation: 为了推动AI发展，需要让大型语言模型（LLM）能够生成高质量的AI内核。然而，现有方法在数据、环境、奖励劫持和懒惰优化等方面存在挑战。

Method: 研究者设计了一个名为KernelGYM的分布式GPU环境，用于支持奖励劫持检查、多轮交互数据收集和长期强化学习训练。在此基础上，他们提出了Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO)来解决GRPO中的偏见策略梯度问题，并引入了失配校正、Profiling-based Rewards (PR) 和 Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) 来克服懒惰优化问题。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种强化学习方法和相应的环境（KernelGYM），并训练了一个名为Dr.Kernel-14B的模型，该模型能够生成高性能的AI内核，并在速度提升方面取得了优于现有先进模型的成果。所有相关资源均已公开。

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

TL;DR: DFPO是一种分布强化学习框架，通过将值建模为跨时间步的连续流来提高鲁棒性、稳定性和泛化能力，特别是在存在噪声监督和分布外（OOD）泛化挑战的情况下，并在对话、数学推理和科学任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于存在噪声监督和糟糕的分布外（OOD）泛化能力，在真实世界环境中训练强化学习（RL）系统仍然具有挑战性，尤其是在大型语言模型（LLM）的后期训练中。现有的分布RL方法虽然通过建模多个分位数点的值来提高鲁棒性，但它们各自独立地学习每个分位数，导致值表示粗糙，缺乏对状态信息的细粒度条件约束，在复杂和OOD条件下表现不佳。

Method: DFPO（Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control）通过学习值流场而非孤立的分位数预测，将值建模为跨时间步的连续流，从而捕捉更丰富的状态信息以进行更准确的优势估计。为了在噪声反馈下稳定训练，DFPO还整合了条件风险控制和沿值流轨迹的一致性约束。

Result: 在对话、数学推理和科学任务上的实验表明，DFPO在噪声监督下优于PPO、FlowRL和其他鲁棒基线方法，实现了更好的训练稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DFPO通过对值进行连续流建模，并结合条件风险控制和一致性约束，能够提供比现有方法更精细的值表示，从而在存在噪声和OOD挑战的情况下，提高RL训练的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

Motivation: 评估时间序列基础模型在电力需求预测中有效利用外生特征的能力，并与基线LSTM进行比较。

Method: 在新加坡和澳大利亚的电力市场，使用MOIRAI、MOMENT、TinyTimeMixers、ChronosX和Chronos-2等基础模型，以及一个带有可逆实例归一化的基线LSTM，在所有特征、选定特征和仅目标特征三种配置下，以每小时和每日粒度进行实证评估。

Conclusion: 基础模型并非在所有场景下都优于传统模型，在能源领域需要特定领域设计的模型，尤其是在稳定气候和短期预测等场景下。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度强化学习（RL）中的超参数敏感性并非固有问题，而是由训练机制（尤其是引导目标）放大的。离线目标条件RL在固定数据分布下表现出更高的鲁棒性，其中QRL算法在引入少量专家数据后展现出稳定的近最优性能，而HIQL算法则对超参数变化敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度强化学习（RL）中的超参数敏感性是固有问题还是由训练机制引起，特别是在离线目标条件RL场景下。

Method: 在离线目标条件RL中，通过改变数据质量（固定和变化）、数据分布（平稳和非平稳）以及测试HIQL和QRL两种算法来研究超参数敏感性。引入了“目标间梯度对齐”诊断来解释算法性能差异。

Result: QRL算法在存在少量专家数据（约20%）时，对超参数配置的变化表现出更广泛、更稳定的近最优性能区域。HIQL算法则表现出尖锐的最优值，并且在训练过程中会显著漂移。引导目标（bootstrapping objectives）被发现会引起更强的破坏性梯度干扰，这与超参数敏感性直接相关。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习（RL）中的超参数敏感性并非不可避免，而是会被引导（bootstrapping）等训练动态所放大。QRL算法的鲁棒性优于HIQL，表明通过改进算法目标设计可以提高RL的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

Conclusion: 提出比特/焦耳度量作为衡量AI物理效率的两个维度（识别和控制），并提供了一个统一的框架和核算约定，以实现更清晰、更一致的AI效率评估。

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法，如GRPO及其变体，通过裁剪似然比来约束策略发散，以确保更新的稳定性。然而，需要一个更通用的框架来分析和改进这些方法。

Conclusion: 原则性的策略发散约束在策略优化中至关重要。KL3估计器作为一种策略发散约束，能够提高RLVR方法的训练稳定性和最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多模态理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但它们在面对不当或对抗性输入时，常常产生不可靠甚至有害的内容。本文提出了一种名为Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ) 的精细化方法，用于检测LVLM的误行为。EUQ通过将模型输出头的特征解释为支持或反对的证据，并利用证据理论来量化内部冲突和知识差距，从而有效识别信息冲突和信息缺失。实验表明，EUQ在处理幻觉、越狱、对抗性漏洞和分布外（OOD）故障等四类误行为方面优于现有基线方法，并揭示了幻觉与高内部冲突以及OOD故障与高信息缺失之间的对应关系。此外，层级证据不确定性动态分析为理解内部表征的演变提供了新视角。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在面对不当或对抗性输入时，会产生不可靠或有害的内容，这阻碍了它们在关键应用中的部署。现有的不确定性量化方法在识别这些误行为方面效果有限，因为它们通常只能捕捉整体的认知不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ) 的精细化方法。该方法将模型输出头的特征解释为支持（正面）或反对（负面）的证据。利用证据理论，EUQ在一次前向传播中对证据进行建模和聚合，以量化模型内部的冲突和知识差距。

Result: EUQ方法在四个类别的误行为（幻觉、越狱、对抗性漏洞和分布外（OOD）故障）上得到了广泛评估，并表现优于强基线方法。研究发现，幻觉与高内部冲突相关，而OOD故障与高信息缺失相关。此外，层级证据不确定性动态分析提供了理解内部表征演变的新视角。

Conclusion: EUQ是一种有效的精细化方法，能够通过量化内部冲突和知识差距来检测大型视觉语言模型的误行为。该方法在处理多种误行为方面表现出色，并为理解模型不确定性和内部表征提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在LLM推理中效率低下，探索和难度适应是主要挑战，源于GRAE中固有的隐式优势对称性。

Method: 提出不对称GRAE（A-GRAE），通过动态调节探索激励和样本难度焦点来解决GRAE中的对称性问题。

Result: A-GRAE在七个基准测试中，一致地提高了GRPO及其在LLM和MLLM上的变体的性能。

Conclusion: GRAE中的对称性是次优的，不对称地抑制正确轨迹的优势可以促进探索，而课程学习式的难度适应可以最大化学习效率。A-GRAE通过引入不对称性解决了这些问题，并在LLM和MLLM上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention, and existing pruning methods struggle with differentiability, efficiency, and static budget requirements for hardware overhead.

Result: Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54x wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines and eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT effectively addresses the computational costs of DiTs by reconciling differentiability, efficiency, and static budget requirements, setting a new standard for efficient diffusion model pruning.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into small synthetic ones. Existing diffusion-based methods are slow and unstable due to heuristic guidance. PGFM, a new flow matching framework, offers fast, stable, and efficient distillation by learning latent space transport with path-guided control, outperforming diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based dataset distillation methods suffer from time-consuming sampling, trajectory instability, and poor downstream generalization, especially under strong control or low IPC, due to reliance on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment.

Method: PGFM utilizes flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to the data distribution. It employs a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, ensuring reliable trajectory landing on prototypes while maintaining diversity and efficiency.

Result: PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches in performance on high-resolution benchmarks, using significantly fewer sampling steps. It achieves competitive performance with improved efficiency, demonstrated by being 7.6x more efficient than diffusion-based counterparts while maintaining 78% mode coverage.

Conclusion: PGFM is the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, offering a fast, stable, and efficient alternative to diffusion-based methods. Its path-guided approach enables reliable and diverse synthesis with significantly improved efficiency, making it a promising direction for dataset distillation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

Motivation: Mode-dependent architectural components like Batch Normalization can destabilize on-policy optimization in visual reinforcement learning, leading to issues like policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse in PPO.

Method: Propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure designed to stabilize PPO when using mode-dependent layers, without requiring modifications to the existing architecture.

Result: Experiments show that MDR consistently enhances stability and performance in procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks, and is applicable to other mode-dependent layers.

Conclusion: MDR effectively stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers, offering improved performance and stability without architectural changes, and shows potential for broader application with other similar layers.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Result: 在 TabArena 基准测试中，TACO 的推理时间比最先进的表格 Transformer 架构快 94 倍，内存消耗减少 97%，性能无明显下降。TACO 的扩展性更好，并且优于其他基线。

Conclusion: TACO 是一种有效的表格压缩模型，能够显著提高处理大规模表格数据的效率，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

### [200] [Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656)
*Igor Santos-Grueiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 行为评估是评估大型语言模型（LLM）对齐的主要范式，但这种从行为证据推断潜在对齐的过程通常是隐含的且未经充分分析。本文将对齐评估视为部分可观察性下的可识别性问题，并允许智能体行为依赖于与评估机制相关的信息。研究表明，在有限的行为评估和具有评估意识的智能体存在的情况下，观察到的行为合规性并不能唯一地确定潜在对齐。因此，行为对齐测试应被视为不可区分性类别的估计量，而不是对齐的验证者。通过更严格的测试可以缩小兼容假设的空间，但在所述条件下无法将其压缩到单一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）对齐的评估方法通常依赖于行为评估，但从观察到的行为推断潜在的对齐特性这一过程缺乏形式化分析。因此，需要深入研究这一推断过程本身。

Method: 将对齐评估形式化为一个在部分可观察性下的可识别性问题。引入了“对齐可验证性问题”和“规范不可区分性”的概念，用于分析在不同潜在对齐假设下，可被评估者观察到的信号分布是否相同。然后，在有限的行为评估和评估感知智能体存在的框架下，推导了一个关于潜在对齐可识别性的负面但有明确界定的定理。

Result: 在有限的行为评估和评估感知智能体存在的条件下，观察到的行为合规性并不能唯一地确定潜在的对齐特性。即使是理想化的行为评估，也不能普遍地将对齐作为一种潜在属性进行认证。

Conclusion: 行为对齐测试应该被视为对不可区分性类别的估计，而不是对潜在对齐的验证。尽管更严格的测试可以缩小与观察到的行为兼容的潜在对齐假设的范围，但在所提出的条件下，它们无法将假设空间压缩到只有一个可能性的状态。因此，对齐基准测试应被理解为在特定评估机制下提供可观察合规性的上限，而不是对潜在对齐的保证。

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机梯度下降（SGD）及其变种（如剪辑SGD）在非凸损失和不同噪声假设下的长期尾部衰减行为，利用大偏差理论建立了梯度范数平方的上界，并给出了下界，证明了其衰减速率在多对数因子内是最优的，且显著优于现有有限时间界限的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注SGD在固定概率阈值下的高概率保证，缺乏对固定误差阈值下的失败概率（尾部衰减率）的直接研究。此外，现有结果多为有限时间性质，无法捕捉现代深度学习模型（通常训练数百万次迭代）的长期尾部衰减特性。本文旨在弥合这些差距，研究SGD算法的长期尾部衰减。

Method: 本文运用大偏差理论来研究SGD及其变种（如剪辑SGD）在不同噪声假设（包括有界噪声、重尾噪声）下的长期尾部衰减行为。具体地，文章推导了最佳迭代产生的梯度范数平方的上限，并建立了尾部衰减的下限。

Result: 对于标准SGD，在非凸损失和有限噪声下，最佳迭代的梯度范数平方的尾部衰减率为 $e^{-t/r{	ext{log}}(t)}$。对于剪辑SGD，在重尾噪声（矩为 $p r{	ext{in}} (1,2]$）下，尾部衰减率为 $e^{-t^{eta_p}/r{	ext{log}}(t)}$，其中 $eta_p = rac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ 对于 $p r{	ext{in}} (1,2)$，当 $p = 2$ 时为 $e^{-t/r{	ext{log}}^2(t)}$。文章还给出了 $e^{-t}$ 的下界，表明SGD和c-SGD的衰减速率在多对数因子内是最优的。与基于有限时间界限的现有工作（速率为 $e^{-r{	ext{sqrt}}(t)}$ 和 $e^{-t^{eta_p/2}}$）相比，本文结果显示出数量级上更快的长期尾部衰减。

Conclusion: 本文通过大偏差理论研究了SGD和剪辑SGD算法的长期尾部衰减，建立了梯度范数平方的紧确上界（在多对数因子内），揭示了比以往已知的更快的尾部衰减机制，为现代训练模型提供了更强的长期个体运行保证。

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.

TL;DR: 通过选择一小部分代表性的核心数据集来解决功能连接（FC）基准测试中的计算瓶颈，以保留FC算子的相对性能排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对大规模fMRI数据集上的数百种FC建模方法进行基准测试对于可重复的神经科学至关重要，但计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出了一种名为SCLCS（Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection）的自监督框架，该框架首先使用自适应Transformer学习每个样本的FC结构，然后引入结构扰动得分（SPS）来量化这些学习结构的稳定性，最后通过密度平衡采样策略来确保核心集的鲁棒性和代表性。

Result: 在REST-meta-MDD数据集上，SCLCS仅使用10%的数据就保留了真实的模型排名，在排名一致性（nDCG@k）方面比最先进的核心集选择方法提高了23.2%。

Conclusion: SCLCS首次将核心集选择形式化，用于FC算子基准测试，使大规模算子比较成为计算神经科学中可行且 integral 的一部分。

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 即使在收敛、校准良好且通过常规诊断的情况下，标准推断程序也可能系统性地得出错误结论，尤其是在观测数据的可靠性以推断过程无法察觉的方式下降时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学日益依赖庞大的观测数据集和自动推理流程，普遍认为更多数据能提高科学结论的可靠性。本文旨在揭示这一信念在特定情况下可能失效。

Method: 使用最小的合成实验来演示在特定结构下，额外数据不会纠正错误，反而会放大错误，而基于残差和拟合优度的诊断检查仍然显示正常。

Result: 在识别出的结构状态下，标准推断程序会收敛到不正确的结论，即使它们表现出平稳收敛、良好校准并通过了常规的诊断检查。额外的数据会放大而非纠正这些错误，而基于残差的诊断和拟合优度检验仍然具有误导性地正常。

Conclusion: 稳定性、收敛性和置信度并不足以保证知识的有效性。推断过程不应仅仅依赖于数据可用性，而必须受到观测过程完整性显式约束的指导，这揭示了数据驱动科学的内在局限性。

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为PBP的框架，用于解决传统方法难以处理的高维观测空间的部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）问题。PBP通过引入一个图像分类器将视觉观测映射到状态的概率分布，并将其整合到信念更新中，从而使底层求解器无需直接处理高维观测空间。研究还提出了处理分类器不精确性的方法，并进行了实证研究，证明PBP优于现有的深度强化学习方法，并且不确定性量化能提高其对抗视觉干扰的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 传统基于信念和滤波的POMDP求解器在处理高维观测空间（如图像）的现实问题时存在困难。

Method: 提出感知基础信念（PBP）框架，该框架包含一个图像分类器，将视觉观测映射到状态的概率分布，并直接将其纳入信念更新过程。研究还引入了不确定性量化方法来处理分类器的不精确性，并提出了两种调整信念更新的方法。

Conclusion: PBP框架能够有效解决传统POMDP求解器在高维观测空间下的难题，并且通过不确定性量化可以进一步提高其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

TL;DR: 进化搜索和大型语言模型被用来发现新的激活函数，这些函数能够提高模型性能，并能嵌入特定的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数的选择是改进优化和保持模型表达能力的关键因素。手动设计的搜索空间限制了新激活函数的发现。此外，激活函数可以控制模型的非线性行为和归纳偏置。

Method: 利用AlphaEvolve等现代流水线，以大型语言模型作为突变算子，进行进化搜索。该方法允许在一定的计算量预算内搜索所有可能的Python函数，消除了手动构建搜索空间的需要。通过将分布外数据的性能作为适应度函数，可以引导搜索发现能够编码特定归纳偏置的激活函数。

Result: 实验表明，即使是小规模的合成数据集，也足以让AlphaEvolve发现有意义的激活函数。

Conclusion: 进化搜索框架，特别是结合了大型语言模型的流水线，为发现新的激活函数提供了有效且灵活的方法。该方法不仅能提高模型性能，还能通过优化分布外性能来发现具有特定归纳偏置的激活函数。

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

*Arno Geimer,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Learning (FL) involves participants contributing data and resources, necessitating fair contribution assessment for engagement and security. However, contribution estimations in FL are inherently unstable across different aggregation strategies, potentially deterring participant involvement. This paper introduces FedRandom, a novel technique to mitigate this instability by treating contribution assessment as a statistical estimation problem. FedRandom generates additional samples compared to standard FL strategies, leading to more consistent and reliable evaluations of participant contributions. Experiments on various datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100, FMNIST) demonstrate that FedRandom reduces the distance to the ground truth by over a third in 50% of scenarios and improves stability in over 90% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) requires fair assessment of individual participant contributions to incentivize engagement and identify malicious actors, but existing contribution estimation methods suffer from significant instability across different aggregation strategies, which can negatively impact participant willingness to join the federation.

Method: FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique for contribution instability in FL, frames contribution assessment as a statistical estimation problem. It generates more samples than standard FL strategies, enabling more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions.

Result: FedRandom was evaluated using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and FMNIST. The results show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

Conclusion: FedRandom effectively addresses the problem of contribution instability in Federated Learning by providing a more stable and reliable method for evaluating participant contributions, thereby potentially enhancing participant engagement and the overall integrity of federated systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

Result: 理论推导和在合成及真实世界基准（Adult, COMPAS）上的实验均验证了作者的预测。提出的协议消除了虚假的权衡，揭示了真实的公平性-效用前沿。

Conclusion: 在亚群体迁移的情况下，不准确的群体比例是导致预测准确性和公平性之间出现虚假张力的原因。通过优化的数据权重调整和正确的评估协议，可以更准确地揭示公平性干预的真实成本。

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

TL;DR: FairBoost将组合算法与公平性约束相结合，通过在公平约束集上重新加权来保持可分析的训练动态，从而在准确性和公平性之间取得权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何将群体公平性约束纳入Boosting算法，同时保持可分析的训练动态。

Method: FairBoost将由集成产生的指数权重分布投影到满足公平性约束的分布的凸集上（作为重加权替代），然后基于这个公平分布训练弱学习器。理论上的关键见解是，投影训练分布会将弱学习器的有效优势减少一个由KL散度控制的数量。

Result: 理论上，证明了一个指数损失界限，其中收敛速率取决于弱学习器优势减去一个“公平成本”项 $δ_t = 	rust{rac{	extrm{KL}(w^t 	right| q^t)}{2}}$。实验验证了理论预测，并在准确性-公平性权衡方面表现出竞争力，同时具有稳定的训练曲线。

Conclusion: FairBoost提供了一个量化Boosting算法中准确性-公平性权衡的理论框架，并通过实验证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $δ_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.

Motivation: Muon 优化器通过梯度的矩阵符号更新矩阵参数，虽然在实践中取得了显著的经验收益，但其动态和扩展行为在理论上仍不清楚。

Method: 在具有 softmax 检索和查询-答案对的分层频率谱的线性联想记忆模型中研究 Muon，并加入或不加入标签噪声。在这些设置下，分析了梯度下降（GD）和 Muon 的学习动态。

Result: 在无噪声的情况下，Muon 比 GD 加速了指数级；在有噪声且频率谱呈幂次衰减的情况下，推导了 Muon 的优化扩展定律，并证明了其比 GD 具有更优越的扩展效率。此外，还表明 Muon 可被解释为源于自适应任务对齐和块对称梯度结构的隐式矩阵预处理。

Conclusion: Muon 优化器通过提供理论分析，阐明了其动态和扩展行为，证明了其在各种设置下比 GD 具有更快的收敛速度和更好的扩展效率。实验结果支持这些发现。

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice.

TL;DR: Prompt injection is a critical LLM vulnerability. We propose AutoInject, an RL framework for generating universal, transferable adversarial suffixes that optimize attack success and utility preservation. This black-box method supports query-based optimization and transfer attacks. AutoInject successfully compromised frontier systems like GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on AgentDojo, setting a new baseline for automated prompt injection research.

Conclusion: AutoInject establishes a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research by demonstrating successful compromise of frontier systems with a universal, transferable adversarial suffix generator.

Abstract: Prompt injection is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents; yet, effective automated attacks remain largely unexplored from an optimization perspective. Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

### [213] [Variational Speculative Decoding: Rethinking Draft Training from Token Likelihood to Sequence Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05774)
*Xiandong Zou,Jianshu Li,Jing Huang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Speculative decoding methods for LLMs face a training-decoding gap because existing training optimizes single greedy paths while decoding considers multiple draft paths. Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD) addresses this by treating draft training as variational inference over latent draft paths. VSD maximizes the marginal probability of acceptance, using an ELBO to encourage good proposals and minimize divergence. It includes a path-level utility and uses EM for optimization: the E-step samples from a filtered posterior, and the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood with ARW and CAR. VSD theoretically increases acceptance length and speed, and experimentally achieves significant speedups over prior methods on LLMs and MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods optimize single greedy trajectories during training, which mismatches the decoding process that involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. This training-decoding discrepancy limits inference efficiency.

Method: VSD formulates draft training as variational inference over latent draft paths, aiming to maximize the marginal probability of target-model acceptance. This objective yields an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) that encourages high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. A path-level utility is introduced to enhance proposal quality and reduce variance. Optimization is performed using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure, where the E-step involves MCMC sampling from an oracle-filtered posterior, and the M-step maximizes a weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR).

Result: VSD achieves significant improvements in decoding efficiency. Experiments across various LLMs and MLLMs demonstrate that VSD provides speedups of up to 9.6% compared to EAGLE-3 and 7.9% compared to ViSpec.

Conclusion: VSD effectively bridges the training-decoding gap in speculative decoding by employing variational inference over latent draft paths. Theoretical analysis and empirical results confirm that VSD enhances expected acceptance length and decoding speed, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中跨域策略适应的挑战，特别是当源域和目标域的动态不匹配时，如何有效利用源域数据来增强目标域策略学习的问题。

Method: 提出一种选择性转移校正（STC）算法。该算法利用逆向策略模型和奖励模型来校正源域转移中的动作和奖励，使其与目标域的动态对齐。此外，还使用一个正向动力学模型来筛选校正后的样本，保留那些与目标域动态更匹配的样本，从而更可靠地利用源域数据。

Conclusion: STC算法能够可靠地利用源域数据进行策略适应，即使在源域和目标域的动态存在显著差异的情况下，也能通过校正和选择机制有效缓解不匹配问题，从而提升目标域策略的学习效果。

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散桥批评家（DBC）是一种新的基于扩散模型的方法，用于解决连续控制任务中的强化学习（RL）价值估计问题。它通过直接模拟Q值的逆累积分布函数（CDF）来准确地捕捉价值分布，解决了现有方法中的价值分布崩溃问题，并通过分析积分公式解决了离散化误差。实验证明DBC在MuJoCo机器人控制基准测试中优于现有的分布批评家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散策略在连续控制任务中取得了显著进展，但忽略了扩散批评家的应用。然而，策略优化依赖于批评家，因此准确的价值估计比策略表达能力更为重要。此外，鉴于强化学习任务的随机性，使用分布模型来描述批评家更为合适。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于扩散桥批评家（DBC）的分布强化学习方法。DBC直接对Q值的逆累积分布函数（CDF）进行建模，利用扩散桥强大的分布匹配能力来准确捕捉价值分布，防止其崩溃为高斯分布。此外，推导了一个分析积分公式来解决DBC中的离散化误差。

Result: 在MuJoCo机器人控制基准测试中，DBC的实验结果表明其性能优于以前的分布批评家模型。

Conclusion: DBC是首个将扩散桥模型用作批评家的研究，它能够准确估计价值分布并解决离散化误差，在连续控制任务中展现出优越性，并且可以作为即插即用组件集成到现有的强化学习框架中。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

Result: Bifrost在跨任务轨迹复用方面，相比现有轨迹复用和微调方法，在多样的基准测试中均表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: Bifrost能够有效弥合上下文漂移造成的轨迹失准，使智能体能在存在显著上下文变化的情况下，依然能够有效地利用过往经验进行自我提升。

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive learning rate scheduling is studied for norm-constrained optimizers, leading to a new scheduler with automatic warm-up duration. This scheduler matches or exceeds manually tuned schedules in LLM pretraining without extra search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper studies adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers like Muon and Lion, aiming to improve convergence guarantees and develop a practical scheduler.

Method: A generalized smoothness assumption is introduced and verified empirically. Based on this assumption, convergence guarantees are established, leading to a practical learning rate scheduler with automatic warm-up duration.

Result: The developed adaptive scheduler, when evaluated on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures, consistently matched or outperformed manually tuned warm-up schedules across all setups, without requiring additional hyperparameter search.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive learning rate scheduler, which automatically adjusts warm-up duration based on a generalized smoothness assumption, is effective and practical for large language model pretraining, offering comparable or superior performance to manual tuning.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

TL;DR: 通过模拟过参数化来逃离伪局部极小值，用于低秩矩阵感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩矩阵感知是一个非凸优化问题，通常存在许多伪局部极小值，阻碍了基于梯度的优化器收敛到全局最优解。

Method: 提出了一种模拟预言机方向（SOD）的逃逸机制，通过在不进行实际张量提升的情况下，模拟过参数化空间中的逃逸方向，并将这些方向投影到原始参数空间，以保证从现有局部极小值开始目标值的严格下降。

Result: 数值实验表明，该框架能够可靠地逃离局部极小值并促进收敛到全局最优解，同时与显式的张量过参数化相比，计算成本极低。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种在不使用随机扰动或启发式估计的情况下，逃离伪局部极小值的确定性方法，并对非凸优化具有启示意义。

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

Motivation: Transformer 架构的计算能力仍有待深入理解，特别是其在解决特定问题（如 PARITY）方面的能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的 Transformer 构造方法，该方法使用 Softmax、长度无关且多项式有界的 positional encoding，无需 layernorm，并且兼容因果掩码（causal masking）。此外，还给出了 Transformer 解决 PARITY 问题的首个下界证明，表明单层 Transformer 无法独立完成此任务。

Result: 提出了一种新的 Transformer 构造方法，能够解决 PARITY 问题，并且满足更宽松的条件（如无需 layernorm，兼容因果掩码）。证明了单层 Transformer 无法解决 PARITY 问题。

Conclusion: Transformer 架构在解决 PARITY 问题方面并非没有限制，但通过新的构造和下界分析，我们对 Transformer 的计算能力有了更清晰的认识。

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在训练后会接触到各种数据集，但这些数据集除了预期的模式外，还可能包含偶然的、意外的模式，这些模式可能源于数据的格式、措辞或数据选择过程。这些模式对开发者来说可能并不明显，但对模型来说却很重要，从而导致模型出现出乎意料的行为，例如因问题的特定格式而拒绝真实的事实。这种现象被称为“块状训练后”（chunky post-training），即模型学习到了由训练后数据块引起的虚假关联。本研究提出了SURF（运行时发现意外行为的黑盒流水线）和TURF（将故障追溯到特定训练后数据的工具）。通过将这些工具应用于前沿模型（Claude 4.5、GPT-5.1、Grok 4.1、Gemini 3）和开源模型（Tülu 3），研究表明，块状训练后会导致模型行为失准，而这通常源于训练后数据块的不平衡或不充分。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在训练后，虽然接触了多样化的数据集，但这些数据集除了包含预期的模式外，还可能编码了偶然的模式，例如格式与内容的关联、不同问题间的措辞相似性以及数据选择过程中产生的隐性关联。这些模式对开发者而言往往是不可见的，但模型却能识别并学习它们，从而导致模型产生出乎开发者意料的行为，例如因问题的特定格式而拒绝真实信息。

Method: 本研究提出SURF（一个运行时识别意外行为的黑盒流水线）和TURF（一个用于将模型失败追溯到特定训练后数据的工具），以解决LLM训练后数据中存在的意外模式问题。

Result: 研究将SURF和TURF应用于Claude 4.5、GPT-5.1、Grok 4.1、Gemini 3等前沿模型以及Tülu 3等开源模型。实验结果表明，“块状训练后”（chunky post-training）现象确实会导致模型行为失准，并且这些行为的产生往往归因于训练后数据块的不平衡或定义不明确。

Conclusion: “块状训练后”（chunky post-training）现象是导致LLM行为失准的重要原因，它源于模型在训练后接触的数据集中学习到了与预期无关的虚假关联。SURF和TURF工具能够有效识别并追溯这些问题，为改进LLM的训练数据和模型行为提供了解决方案。

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

TL;DR: 策略镜像下降（PMD）是一种用于强化学习（RL）的原则性框架，但其封闭形式更新需要可靠的配分函数估计，这在LLM的广阔动作空间中是一个挑战。本文提出了一种名为PMD-mean的实用算法，通过使用采样策略下的平均奖励来近似对数配分项，并在对数策略空间中进行回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM的广阔动作空间中，理想的封闭形式PMD更新需要可靠的配分函数估计，这在有限的采样中是一个重大挑战。

Method: PMD-mean算法通过使用采样策略下的平均奖励来近似对数配分项，并在对数策略空间中进行回归，隐式地优化了具有自适应混合KL--$χ^2$正则化的镜像下降子问题。

Result: PMD-mean算法通过隐式地优化具有自适应混合KL--$χ^2$正则化的镜像下降子问题，在高期望奖励下可以产生保守的更新，并提高对有限样本估计误差的鲁棒性。在数学推理任务上的实验表明，PMD-mean在稳定性和时间效率方面均优于现有算法。

Conclusion: PMD-mean算法通过近似对数配分项并引入自适应混合KL--$χ^2$正则化，在LLM的RL应用中实现了更稳定、更高效的更新，加深了对PMD-mean的理解，并为RL算法的改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

TL;DR: Flow and diffusion models struggle with post-training adaptation to user preferences (reward alignment). We propose Diamond Maps, stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time by amortizing simulation steps and preserving stochasticity. Experiments show Diamond Maps are efficiently learned, achieve stronger reward alignment, and scale better than existing methods, offering a practical route to adaptable generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient reward alignment should be an intrinsic property of generative models, not an add-on, as current methods are costly and brittle.

Method: Redesigned flow map models to create "Diamond Maps", which are stochastic and allow for efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. This is achieved by amortizing simulation steps into a single-step sampler while maintaining the necessary stochasticity for optimal reward alignment. This design also enables scalable search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance through efficient and consistent value function estimation.

Result: Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently through distillation from GLASS Flows. They demonstrate superior reward alignment performance and better scalability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Diamond Maps offer a practical approach to developing generative models that can be quickly adapted to diverse preferences and constraints during inference.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

Motivation: 现有的模型合并方法在线性算术中执行，这会破坏预训练权重的几何特性。

Method: 提出了一种名为 OrthoMerge 的方法，该方法在由正交群形成的黎曼流形上执行合并操作，以保留模型权重的几何结构。它通过将 OFT 学习到的特定任务正交矩阵映射到李代数来实现这一点，从而能够对适应的方向和强度进行有原则且高效的集成。此外，还通过正交-残差解耦策略将此方法扩展到使用非 OFT 方法（低秩微调、完全微调）进行微调的通用模型。该技术通过求解正交 Procrustes 问题来提取专家模型的正交分量，然后在正交群流形上合并，同时通过标准的加性合并处理剩余的线性残差。

Result: OrthoMerge 在减轻灾难性遗忘和在各种任务中保持模型性能方面是有效的。

Conclusion: OrthoMerge 是一种在黎曼流形上执行合并操作的模型合并方法，以保留预训练权重的几何结构。

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: Thompson sampling (TS) 在多臂老虎机问题中被广泛应用，但其在自适应数据收集下的推断性质具有微妙之处。经典样本均值渐近理论在这种情况下可能失效，因为臂的选择次数是随机的，并且与奖励一同被包含在动作选择规则中。本文研究了 K 臂高斯老虎机问题中的这一现象，并确定“乐观性”是恢复“稳定性”的关键机制。“稳定性”是有效渐近推断的充分条件，要求每个臂的选择次数集中在一个确定的尺度附近。首先，我们证明了方差膨胀的 TS (variance-inflated TS) 对于任何 K ≥ 2 的臂都是稳定的，包括多个最优臂的困难情况。这通过将 Halder 等人 (2025) 的结果从双臂推广到普遍的 K 臂情况，解决了他们提出的开放性问题。其次，我们分析了一种替代的乐观方法，该方法保持后验方差不变，但向后验均值添加了一个明确的奖励项，并得出了相同的稳定性结论。总而言之，通过适当实现的乐观性可以稳定 Thompson sampling，并实现多臂老虎机问题中渐近有效的推断，同时只带来轻微的额外遗憾成本。

Conclusion: 通过适当实现的乐观性机制（如方差膨胀或显式奖励项）， Thompson sampling 在多臂老虎机问题中可以实现稳定性，从而保证渐近有效的推断，并且这种改进只带来轻微的额外遗憾成本。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

TL;DR: Share是一种参数高效的持续微调方法，通过学习和动态更新单一共享的低秩子空间，实现了跨任务和模态的无缝适应，有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，参数和内存效率远超LoRA，并支持可扩展的异步持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际部署中，高效且持续地使大型预训练模型适应新任务至关重要，但由于灾难性遗忘和高昂的重新训练成本，这一直是项挑战。现有的参数高效调优方法（如LoRA）计算成本低，但缺乏严格的持续学习和知识整合机制，且需要数据回放或多个适配器。

Method: Share通过学习和动态更新单一、共享的低秩子空间来构建基础子空间，提取过去任务的核心知识，并通过识别必要的子空间方向来逐步整合新信息。每个新任务的知识都被纳入不断演化的子空间，促进知识前向迁移，同时最大限度地减少灾难性干扰。

Result: Share实现了高达100倍的参数缩减和281倍的内存节省，性能与联合训练模型相当。单个Share模型可替代数百个特定任务的LoRA适配器，支持可扩展的异步持续学习。在图像分类、自然语言理解、3D姿态估计和文本到图像生成等方面的实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Share为大型AI系统中的终身学习提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）虽然减少了可训练参数的数量，但对于不断增长的大型语言模型（LLM）来说，这种减少可能仍然不足。需要一种更有效的方法来适应模型的知识。

Method: 通过测量其对内部表示变化的影响来确定要微调的最相关层。该方法与现有的低秩自适应技术正交且易于兼容。

Result: 与在所有层上使用LoRA相比，将可训练参数减少了多达50%，并且在不同的模型和任务中保持了预测性能。在编码器-only架构上，GLUE基准测试的性能下降可忽略不计。在解码器-only架构上，在数学问题解决和编码任务上实现了性能的小幅下降或甚至提升。在多模态模型上，与在所有层上使用LoRA模块进行微调相比，也取得了有竞争力的数据。

Conclusion: 仅微调LLM中最重要的几层是参数高效的，并且可以减少计算成本，同时保持或提高性能。

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

Motivation: To formally address how compute availability influences reinforcement learning (RL) policy learning and generalization, and to investigate if policies with a fixed parameter count can benefit from additional compute, addressing the conflation of compute and parameters in standard deep RL architectures.

Method: Formalize compute-bounded policies and propose a minimal architecture capable of variable compute usage, drawing from algorithmic learning and model-free planning.

Result: Empirical validation on 31 diverse RL tasks shows the proposed architecture improves performance and generalization on longer-horizon tasks solely through increased compute, outperforming standard feedforward and deep residual networks (which used up to 5x more parameters).

Conclusion: Policies that utilize more compute can solve more complex problems and generalize better to tasks with longer horizons, even when the number of parameters is constant. The proposed architecture demonstrates this advantage.

Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE). This paper provides the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that sufficient curiosity ensures both coherent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and efficient decision-making (no-regret optimization). The analysis connects AIF to Bayesian experimental design and optimization, offering practical guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off.

Motivation: To understand when the balance between epistemic and pragmatic value in active inference (AIF) leads to coherent learning and efficient decision-making, and to provide theoretical guarantees for EFE-minimizing agents.

Method: Established the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents by analyzing the role of sufficient curiosity in ensuring self-consistent learning and no-regret optimization. Characterized the mechanism's dependence on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment. Translated theories into practical design guidelines and validated them through real-world experiments.

Result: Demonstrated that sufficient curiosity is a single requirement that simultaneously ensures Bayesian posterior consistency and bounded cumulative regret for EFE-minimizing agents. Characterized the dependence of this mechanism on key factors and provided practical design guidelines.

Conclusion: Sufficient curiosity is crucial for active inference agents to achieve both coherent learning and efficient decision-making. The theoretical framework connects AIF to classical Bayesian methods and offers practical guidance for real-world applications.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

Motivation: 为了更可靠地部署机器学习模型，需要对OOD检测进行改进，特别是如何有效利用和聚合语言模型的token嵌入以获得OOD分数。

Method: AP-OOD是一种半监督方法，它通过利用token级别的 OOD 分数来超越简单的平均聚合，从而灵活地在无监督和监督设置之间进行插值，并能利用有限的辅助异常数据。

Conclusion: AP-OOD通过利用token级别的 OOD 分数来改进聚合方法，从而提高了文本OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

*Luca M. Schulze Buschoff,Konstantinos Voudouris,Can Demircan,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 预训练的视觉-语言模型在物理世界直觉方面表现不佳。尽管监督微调和交互式学习可以提高模型在特定物理任务上的表现，但它们未能让模型掌握可泛化的物理规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有研究表明监督微调可改善模型在简单物理任务上的表现，但这些模型似乎并未习得能在新情境中泛化的鲁棒物理规则。认知科学的研究启发我们，模型需要通过与环境交互才能真正理解物理动态。

Method: 通过强化学习训练模型与环境交互，以学习物理动态。

Result: 通过交互学习能提高模型在特定任务内的表现，但未能培养出具有泛化物理直觉的模型。即使任务具有相同的视觉统计和物理原理，在某一任务上训练过的模型也无法可靠地泛化到相关任务。

Conclusion: 无论是通过监督微调还是交互式学习，当前的训练方法都未能使视觉-语言模型获得可泛化的物理直觉。模型需要更有效的学习机制来理解和推理物理世界。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.
