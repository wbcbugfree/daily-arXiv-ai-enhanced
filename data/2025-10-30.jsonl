A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality."}

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,\nmulti-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful\nAdvanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built\nupon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative\nRefinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

We measure the step-wise\ncausal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a\nproposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave\nbetween true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final\noutput) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of\nreasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result.

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This\ngenerator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth\nreasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing\nfor accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by\njointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic\nalignment with ground-truth reasoning.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization.

To address the limitation in passive\nexploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments\nexploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and\nsynthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is\ncomposed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes\ncritical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each\nstate's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step\nimagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the\ncritical states for agent learning.

Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the\nNDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each\nlayer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters\ndirectly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The\narchitecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer\nimplementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired\nby normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the\nmanifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that\noptimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a\ndual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive\ncurvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that\nenhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient\ndescent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers\nunprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear\ngeometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,\nincluding its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual\nlearning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative\nmodeling.

A\nsimple linear probe decodes the internal \"solvability belief\" of a model,\nrevealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and\nacross math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -\nalthough belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear\neffective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the\nsubsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families.

The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed\nmachine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set\nof data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to\noptimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously\ntraining each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates\nthe problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and\n(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing\nnetwork among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to\nensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time\nfeasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint\nholds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows\naddressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing\nchannels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,\ndistributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the\nML training models.

Traditional\napproaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits\nthe opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to\npredict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to\na more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take\nprecautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications."}

The\ngoverning partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often\nintractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,\ncharacterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with\nincomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven\nmethods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are\noften physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing\nphysics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex\noperators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we\npropose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally\nadvances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of\nphysical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level\narchitecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level\nlearns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their\ngoverning combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces\nlearning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of\nprior knowledge.

This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing\ntechniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use\nstochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may\nnot necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding\nstates.

In contrast, model\nmerging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training\nmultiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically\nweighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model\nparameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.\nTo address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates\nthe running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the\ngeneralization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these\ntwo different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing\nthe state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the\nweighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and\nmulti-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across\ndiverse evaluation settings."}

Developing\nautomated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.\nFor example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet\nbillions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the\nbroader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to\nsynthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and\nvalidates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat\nRescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming\napproach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct\nLLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,\nModerate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and\nparaphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited\ntranscripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic\ndegradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,\nword count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on\nthe results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune\nmodels for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and\nusefulness of the synthetic transcripts."}

To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery.
