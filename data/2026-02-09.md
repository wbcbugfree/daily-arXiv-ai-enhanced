Abstract: Slogans are concise and memorable catchphrases that play a crucial role in advertising by conveying brand identity and shaping public perception. However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines.

### [2] [Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding for Retrieval-augmented Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06050)
*Jongha Kim,Byungoh Ko,Jeehye Na,Jinsung Yoon,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RMCD is a novel RAG decoding method that weights multiple context predictions by relevance, outperforming existing methods on visual QA tasks without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RAG decoding methods for LVLMs are sub-optimal because they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress negative effects of irrelevant contexts, despite RAG being a widely adopted solution to enhance LVLMs' entity knowledge.

Method: RMCD combines outputs predicted with each context by weighting them based on their relevance to the question, effectively aggregating information from relevant contexts while counteracting irrelevant ones.

Result: RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks, is robust to retrieval quality, and can be implemented without additional training.

Conclusion: RMCD is an effective, training-free decoding method that significantly improves LVLM performance on knowledge-intensive tasks by intelligently leveraging and contrasting multiple retrieved contexts.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), they still lack detailed knowledge about specific entities. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

### [3] [CAST: Character-and-Scene Episodic Memory for Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06051)
*Kexin Ma,Bojun Li,Yuhua Tang,Ruochun Jin,Liting Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CAST, a Character-and-Scene based dual memory architecture for LLM agents that models episodic memory via dramatic theory-inspired 3D scenes (time/place/topic) organized into character profiles, combined with graph-based semantic memory, achieving significant improvements in coherent event recall and conversational QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent memory systems prioritize semantic recall and use simplistic structures (key-value/vectors/graphs), failing to represent and retrieve coherent episodic events grounded in specific characters, times, and locations—a core aspect of human memory.

Method: 1) Constructs episodic memory by building 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizing them into character-centric event summaries inspired by dramatic theory. 2) Integrates this with a graph-based semantic memory to form a dual-memory system.

Result: Achieved an average improvement of 8.11% in F1 score and 10.21% in LLM-as-a-Judge (J) score over baselines across multiple datasets, with particularly strong performance on open-domain and time-sensitive conversational questions.

Conclusion: The CAST architecture effectively bridges cognitive theory (dramatic structure) and AI memory design, demonstrating that explicit modeling of episodic events through character-scene frameworks significantly enhances coherent event recall and conversational reasoning in LLM agents.

Abstract: Episodic memory is a central component of human memory, which refers to the ability to recall coherent events grounded in who, when, and where. However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions.

### [4] [Rethinking Memory Mechanisms of Foundation Agents in the Second Half](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06052)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey addresses AI's paradigm shift toward real-world utility by proposing a unified framework for foundation agent memory, analyzing its implementation across topologies and learning policies, reviewing evaluation metrics, and outlining future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI research is transitioning from model-centric benchmarking to solving real-world utility gaps in long-horizon, dynamic environments where agents face context explosion and require continuous information management across extended interactions.

Method: Presents a three-dimensional taxonomy of memory: 1) Substrate (internal/external storage), 2) Cognitive mechanism (episodic/semantic/sensory/working/procedural), 3) Subject (agent/user-centric). Analyzes memory instantiation across agent topologies, learning policies for memory operations, and evaluation benchmarks.

Result: Identifies memory as the critical solution for utility gaps in modern AI agents; provides a unified conceptual framework covering 100+ recent papers; reviews current evaluation methodologies and highlights limitations in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Foundation agent memory is essential for real-world AI utility. Future work must address scalable memory architectures, adaptive learning policies, standardized evaluation for long-term interactions, and ethical considerations in persistent memory systems.

Abstract: The research of artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift from prioritizing model innovations over benchmark scores towards emphasizing problem definition and rigorous real-world evaluation. As the field enters the "second half," the central challenge becomes real utility in long-horizon, dynamic, and user-dependent environments, where agents face context explosion and must continuously accumulate, manage, and selectively reuse large volumes of information across extended interactions. Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations. Finally, we review evaluation benchmarks and metrics for assessing memory utility, and outline various open challenges and future directions.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Assessing research novelty is a core yet highly subjective aspect of peer review, typically based on implicit judgment and incomplete comparison to prior work. We introduce a literature-aware novelty assessment framework that explicitly learns how humans judge novelty from peer-review reports and grounds these judgments in structured comparison to existing research. Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches.

### [6] [Quantifying and Attributing Polarization to Annotator Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06055)
*Dimitris Tsirmpas,John Pavlopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A quantifiable metric with statistical significance testing is proposed to measure annotator polarization across imbalanced sociodemographic groups, overcoming limitations of current agreement metrics for subjective tasks like hate speech and toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inter-annotator agreement metrics are ill-suited for inter-group analysis, biased by group size imbalances, and confined to single-annotation scenarios, rendering them inadequate for subjective annotation tasks requiring polarization attribution to annotator subgroups.

Method: Proposes a novel polarization metric coupled with statistical significance testing that supports cross-dataset, multi-label analysis and enables direct comparison between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological annotator subgroups.

Result: Analysis of three hate speech and one toxicity detection datasets shows: (1) race is a persistent polarization factor in hate speech annotation, (2) religious annotators disagree more with out-groups than in-groups, a pattern that reverses for irreligious annotators, (3) lower education correlates with higher subjectivity while higher education correlates with increased inter-annotator agreement.

Conclusion: The metric successfully characterizes subgroup-specific polarization patterns, validates existing annotation pattern findings, estimates minimum annotator requirements for robustness, and is released as an open-source Python library.

Abstract: Current annotation agreement metrics are not well-suited for inter-group analysis, are sensitive to group size imbalances and restricted to single-annotation settings. These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves. Overall, our results reflect current findings around annotation patterns for various subgroups. Finally, we estimate the minimum number of annotators needed to obtain robust results, and provide an open-source Python library that implements our metric.

### [7] [Stop the Flip-Flop: Context-Preserving Verification for Fast Revocable Diffusion Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06161)
*Yanzheng Xiang,Lan Wei,Yizhen Yao,Qinglin Zhu,Hanqi Yan,Chen Jin,Philip Alexander Teare,Dandan Zhang,Lin Gui,Amrutha Saseendran,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出COVER方法，通过KV缓存覆盖和稳定性感知的种子选择，在单次前向传播中实现留一验证和稳定 drafting，消除 flip-flop 振荡，加速并行扩散语言模型推理而不损失质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩散解码可通过每步解掩码多个 token 来加速推理，但过度并行化会损害生成质量。现有可撤销解码的验证方案经常出现 flip-flop 振荡（token 被重新掩码后又恢复），这会削弱上下文条件并消耗修订预算，导致推理变慢

Method: COVER通过KV缓存覆盖构建双注意力视图：对选定种子进行掩码验证，同时将其缓存的KV状态注入其他查询以保留上下文信息，并使用闭式对角修正防止种子位置的自泄漏。采用稳定性感知评分机制（平衡不确定性、下游影响和缓存漂移）来优先选择种子，并自适应调整每步验证的种子数量

Result: 在多项基准测试中，COVER显著减少了不必要的修订次数，实现了更快的解码速度，同时保持了输出质量

Conclusion: COVER有效消除了可撤销解码中的flip-flop振荡问题，提升了并行扩散语言模型的推理效率，在保持生成质量的前提下实现了加速

Abstract: Parallel diffusion decoding can accelerate diffusion language model inference by unmasking multiple tokens per step, but aggressive parallelism often harms quality. Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.

### [8] [Uncertainty Drives Social Bias Changes in Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06181)
*Stanley Z. Hua,Sanae Lotfi,Irene Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 后训练量化会改变大语言模型的社会偏见模式，出现"量化诱导的掩码偏见翻转"现象，尽管总体偏见分数不变，但高达21%的响应在偏见/无偏见状态间翻转，这种变化在不同人群群体间产生不对称影响，需要量化后评估和干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练量化虽降低了大语言模型的计算成本，但会以聚合指标无法捕捉的方式根本性地改变其社会偏见，现有研究缺乏对这一现象的大规模系统性评估。

Method: 对50个量化模型进行大规模研究，使用PostTrainingBiasBench基准（包含13个封闭式和开放式偏见数据集），分析量化对模型偏见行为的影响。

Result: 发现"量化诱导的掩码偏见翻转"现象：高达21%的响应在偏见和无偏见状态间翻转，但聚合偏见分数未变；这种翻转由模型不确定性驱动（高不确定性响应变化可能性高3-11倍）；4-bit量化模型的行为变化是8-bit模型的4-6倍；偏见变化在不同人群群体间不对称（某些群体偏见恶化达18.6%，而其他群体改善14.1%）；更大模型并未表现出一致的鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: 模型压缩会根本性地改变偏见模式，量化后的评估和干预对确保实际应用中的可靠性至关重要，仅依赖聚合指标会掩盖对特定人群群体的有害影响。

Abstract: Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice.

### [9] [BenchMarker: An Education-Inspired Toolkit for Highlighting Flaws in Multiple-Choice Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06221)
*Nishant Balepur,Bhavya Rajasekaran,Jane Oh,Michael Xie,Atrey Desai,Vipul Gupta,Steven James Moore,Eunsol Choi,Rachel Rudinger,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BenchMarker is an LLM-based toolkit that detects three types of MCQ flaws (contamination, shortcuts, writing errors) in NLP benchmarks, revealing these flaws significantly distort evaluation metrics and rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCQA benchmarks lack rigorous quality control, leading to inaccurate evaluation of NLP models due to flawed questions that can artificially inflate performance or alter model rankings.

Method: Education-inspired toolkit using LLM judges to flag three defects: contamination (online duplication), shortcuts (choice cues enabling guessing), and writing errors (structural/grammatical issues via a 19-rule rubric). Validated with human annotations and audited across 12 benchmarks.

Result: Contaminated MCQs inflate accuracy; writing errors lower accuracy and change rankings beyond random chance; prior repair efforts introduce new flaws (implausible distractors, multiple correct answers) while fixing targeted issues.

Conclusion: Flawed MCQs degrade NLP evaluation reliability, but education research principles offer a path forward. BenchMarker bridges NLP and education fields to improve future benchmark design.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is standard in NLP, but benchmarks lack rigorous quality control. We present BenchMarker, an education-inspired toolkit using LLM judges to flag three common MCQ flaws: 1) contamination - items appearing exactly online; 2) shortcuts - cues in the choices that enable guessing; and 3) writing errors - structural/grammatical issues based on a 19-rule education rubric. We validate BenchMarker with human annotations, then run the tool to audit 12 benchmarks, revealing: 2) contaminated MCQs tend to inflate accuracy, while writing errors tend to lower it and change rankings beyond random; and 3) prior benchmark repairs address their targeted issues (i.e., lowering accuracy with LLM-written distractors), but inadvertently add new flaws (i.e. implausible distractors, many correct answers). Overall, flaws in MCQs degrade NLP evaluation, but education research offers a path forward. We release BenchMarker to bridge the fields and improve MCQA benchmark design.

### [10] [Can One-sided Arguments Lead to Response Change in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06260)
*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究证实通过提供单方面论据可简单有效地引导大语言模型对争议性问题采取特定立场，且该效果在不同模型、论据数量和主题下均稳定存在，但切换论据会削弱引导效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型对争议性问题的初始回应常呈现单一立场或拒绝回答，难以提供平衡观点，需探索简单可控的立场引导方法。

Method: 构建小型数据集，系统研究三个维度：(i) LLM响应中诱导的立场，(ii) 争议问题的表述方式，(iii) 论据的呈现形式，测试单方面论据对模型立场的引导效果。

Result: 单方面论据能有效引导模型立场，该效果在多样化模型、论据数量及主题下均稳定出现；切换对立论据则持续降低引导效果。

Conclusion: 仅需提供单方面论据即可实现LLM立场引导，揭示了模型对输入论据的敏感性，为争议性内容生成控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Polemic questions need more than one viewpoint to express a balanced answer. Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide a balanced answer, but also take a single aligned viewpoint or refuse to answer. In this paper, we study if such initial responses can be steered to a specific viewpoint in a simple and intuitive way: by only providing one-sided arguments supporting the viewpoint. Our systematic study has three dimensions: (i) which stance is induced in the LLM response, (ii) how the polemic question is formulated, (iii) how the arguments are shown. We construct a small dataset and remarkably find that opinion steering occurs across (i)-(iii) for diverse models, number of arguments, and topics. Switching to other arguments consistently decreases opinion steering.

### [11] [MPIB: A Benchmark for Medical Prompt Injection Attacks and Clinical Safety in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06268)
*Junhyeok Lee,Han Jang,Kyu Sung Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPIB, a benchmark for evaluating prompt injection attacks in clinical LLM/RAG systems, measuring both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and novel Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER) to assess real patient safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks can steer clinical LLMs toward unsafe outputs, but existing benchmarks don't adequately measure clinical safety risks. There's a need to disentangle instruction compliance from actual patient harm.

Method: Created MPIB dataset with 9,697 curated instances through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Introduced CHER metric based on clinical harm taxonomy. Evaluated across diverse LLMs and defense configurations for both direct and indirect (RAG-mediated) attacks.

Result: Found substantial divergence between ASR and CHER, showing that successful attacks don't always correlate with patient harm. Robustness critically depends on attack location (user query vs retrieved context).

Conclusion: MPIB enables reproducible research on clinical prompt injection safety. Released evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support systematic safety evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows; however, prompt injection attacks can steer these systems toward clinically unsafe or misleading outputs. We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection. Code and data are available at GitHub (code) and Hugging Face (data).

### [12] [VowelPrompt: Hearing Speech Emotions from Text via Vowel-level Prosodic Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06270)
*Yancheng Wang,Osama Hanna,Ruiming Xie,Xianfeng Rui,Maohao Shen,Xuedong Zhang,Christian Fuegen,Jilong Wu,Debjyoti Paul,Arthur Guo,Zhihong Lei,Ozlem Kalinli,Qing He,Yingzhen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes VowelPrompt, a framework that enhances LLM-based speech emotion recognition by incorporating interpretable, vowel-level prosodic features (pitch, energy, duration) converted into natural language descriptions, trained via SFT+RLVR (GRPO) to achieve SOTA performance with explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at textual emotion reasoning but neglect fine-grained prosodic information crucial for speech affect recognition, limiting both performance and interpretability in multimodal emotion understanding.

Method: VowelPrompt extracts phonetically-grounded prosodic descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments (pitch, energy, duration), converts them to natural language prompts for LLMs, and employs a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning and generalization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show consistent SOTA outperformance across zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions on benchmark datasets, while generating interpretable explanations grounded in both semantics and prosodic structure.

Conclusion: Linguistically-grounded vowel-level prosodic augmentation effectively bridges the gap between textual semantics and paralinguistic expressivity, enabling more accurate and interpretable LLM-based speech emotion recognition.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in speech presents a complex multimodal challenge, requiring comprehension of both linguistic content and vocal expressivity, particularly prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, and temporal dynamics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对数学推理模型的验证瓶颈问题，本文提出基于后果的效用评估器，通过测试解决方案作为上下文示例在相关可验证问题上的表现来评分，无需人工标注，在高质量数学问题上显著优于传统奖励模型和LLM评判器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究级数学推理模型能生成看似合理的解答尝试，但验证环节消耗稀缺的专家时间成为瓶颈。现有评估方法依赖人工标注或奖励模型，存在效率低下和泛化性差的问题。

Method: 提出基于后果的效用(Consequence-Based Utility)评估框架，核心思想是将候选解决方案作为上下文学习示例，评估其在解决相关但可验证问题时的下游性能提升效果。该方法无需人工标注的参考标准，通过测试解决方案的方法级信息可迁移性来判断其质量。

Result: 在自建的研究级数学问题数据集上（包含专家解答和9个LLM生成解答），该方法显著优于奖励模型、生成式奖励模型和LLM评判器。对GPT-OSS-120B模型，Acc@1从67.2提升至76.3，AUC从71.4提升至79.6；对GPT-OSS-20B模型，AUC从69.0提升至79.2。更重要的是，相比LLM评判器，该方法在底层求解器经常失败的案例上仍能保持更强的正确-错误区分能力。

Conclusion: 基于后果的效用评估提供了一种无需人工标注的自动评估范式，通过检验解决方案的泛化能力而非表面正确性，能够更准确地识别高质量方法级推理，为大规模数学推理系统的自动优化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning models suggests that generating plausible attempts for research-level mathematics may be within reach, but verification remains a bottleneck, consuming scarce expert time. We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions. Notably, Consequence-Based Utility consistently outperforms reward models, generative reward models, and LLM judges on ranking quality. Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2). Furthermore, compared to LLM-Judges, it also exhibits a larger solver-evaluator gap, maintaining a stronger correct-wrong separation even on instances where the underlying solver often fails to solve.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework, and FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, to address spoken code-switching parsing failures caused by disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structures that violate standard Universal Dependencies assumptions, achieving up to 52.6% improvement over existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spoken code-switching parsing fails due to violations of standard Universal Dependencies assumptions—including disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structures—coupled with rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine syntactic errors with linguistically acceptable variation, causing parsers and LLMs to perform poorly despite strong written-language performance.

Method: The authors introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken code-switching phenomena, SpokeBench (an expert-annotated gold benchmark for spoken-language structure), FLEX-UD (an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric), and DECAP (a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis).

Result: FLEX-UD reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken code-switching; DECAP achieves up to 52.6% improvements over baselines without retraining, producing more robust and interpretable parses; FLEX-UD further uncovers qualitative improvements masked by standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: A systems-oriented approach using DECAP's decoupled architecture and FLEX-UD's linguistically-aware evaluation effectively addresses spoken code-switching parsing challenges by separating spoken phenomena handling from syntactic analysis and adopting more appropriate evaluation standards.

Abstract: Spoken code-switching (CSW) challenges syntactic parsing in ways not observed in written text. Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics.

### [15] [Can Post-Training Transform LLMs into Causal Reasoners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06337)
*Junqi Chen,Sirui Chen,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过CauGym数据集系统评估五种后训练方法对LLMs因果推理能力的提升效果，发现适当后训练使14B参数小模型在CaLM基准上达93.5%准确率，超越55.4%的OpenAI o3，并展现强泛化性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果推理对决策至关重要但对非专家仍具挑战性；LLMs虽具潜力但因果估计能力有限，且后训练对其因果推理能力的影响缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 构建CauGym数据集（含7个核心因果任务与5个测试集），系统评估SFT、DPO、KTO、PPO、GRPO五种后训练方法，并在5个域内及4个现有基准上开展实验。

Result: 后训练使小参数LLMs具备竞争力，14B模型在CaLM基准上达93.5%准确率（vs OpenAI o3的55.4%）；且在分布偏移和噪声数据下展现强泛化与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 首次系统性证明针对性后训练可产生可靠且鲁棒的LLM因果推理器，为提升小模型因果推理能力提供有效路径。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making but remains challenging for non-experts. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data. Collectively, these findings provide the first systematic evidence that targeted post-training can produce reliable and robust LLM-based causal reasoners. Our data and GRPO-model are available at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CauGym.

*Alberto Andres Valdes Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究对比了LLM提示与微调编码器在文本分类任务上的表现，发现微调模型在成本效益上显著优于LLM，建议采用混合架构而非盲目使用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GPT-4等大语言模型在开放推理任务上表现出色，但在固定标签空间的结构化文本分类任务中，仅关注预测性能而忽略生产系统的延迟和成本约束是不合理的。

Method: 在IMDB、SST-2、AG News和DBPedia四个基准数据集上，系统比较了零样本/少样本LLM提示与完全微调的编码器架构。通过多目标决策分析，使用帕累托前沿和参数化效用函数评估预测质量（宏F1）、推理延迟和货币成本之间的权衡。

Result: 微调BERT系列模型在分类性能上具有竞争力甚至更优，同时成本和延迟比LLM提示低1-2个数量级。

Conclusion: 无差别使用LLM进行标准文本分类会导致次优的系统级结果。微调编码器是结构化NLP流水线的鲁棒高效组件，而LLM更适合作为混合架构中的补充元素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.5 have demonstrated strong capabilities in open-ended reasoning and generative language tasks, leading to their widespread adoption across a broad range of NLP applications. However, for structured text classification problems with fixed label spaces, model selection is often driven by predictive performance alone, overlooking operational constraints encountered in production systems.
  In this work, we present a systematic comparison of two contrasting paradigms for text classification: zero- and few-shot prompt-based large language models, and fully fine-tuned encoder-only architectures. We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost.
  We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting.
  Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes. Instead, fine-tuned encoders emerge as robust and efficient components for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs are better positioned as complementary elements within hybrid architectures. We release all code, datasets, and evaluation protocols to support reproducibility and cost-aware NLP system design.

*Tianqiang Yan,Sihan Shang,Yuheng Li,Song Qiu,Hao Peng,Wenjian Luo,Jue Xie,Lizhen Qu,Yuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReBeCA框架，通过因果分析和不变因果预测(ICP)揭示语言模型自我反思的行为层级结构，发现仅少数语义行为真正因果影响性能，且行为叠加可能损害效果，而非改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于语言模型自我反思的研究多停留在相关性层面，机制不透明且缺乏泛化能力，亟需因果性解释框架来区分真实因果机制与虚假关联。

Method: 将自我反思轨迹建模为因果图，采用三阶段不变因果预测(ICP)流程，通过干预实验和跨任务验证识别因果父节点，实现行为层级的可解释性分析。

Result: 三大发现：1) 语义行为呈层级化影响（直接/间接）；2) 仅少数语义行为决定泛化性；3) 正向行为的叠加可能损害反思效果。ICP识别出稀疏因果特征，结构似然度提升达49.6%，且OOD干预实验显著(p=.013)。

Conclusion: ReBeCA为解构自我反思动态中的因果机制提供了严谨方法论，验证了因果行为稀疏性原理，对构建更可靠的自反思语言模型具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: While self-reflection can enhance language model reliability, its underlying mechanisms remain opaque, with existing analyses often yielding correlation-based insights that fail to generalize. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\texttt{ReBeCA}} (self-\textbf{\texttt{Re}}flection \textbf{\texttt{Be}}havior explained through \textbf{\texttt{C}}ausal \textbf{\texttt{A}}nalysis), a framework that unveils the interpretable behavioral hierarchy governing the self-reflection outcome. By modeling self-reflection trajectories as causal graphs, ReBeCA isolates genuine determinants of performance through a three-stage Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) pipeline. We establish three critical findings: (1) \textbf{Behavioral hierarchy:} Semantic behaviors of the model influence final self-reflection results hierarchically: directly or indirectly; (2) \textbf{Causation matters:} Generalizability in self-reflection effects is limited to just a few semantic behaviors; (3) \textbf{More $\mathbf{\neq}$ better:} The confluence of seemingly positive semantic behaviors, even among direct causal factors, can impair the efficacy of self-reflection. ICP-based verification identifies sparse causal parents achieving up to $49.6\%$ structural likelihood gains, stable across tasks where correlation-based patterns fail. Intervention studies on novel datasets confirm these causal relationships hold out-of-distribution ($p = .013, η^2_\mathrm{p} = .071$). ReBeCA thus provides a rigorous methodology for disentangling genuine causal mechanisms from spurious associations in self-reflection dynamics.

### [18] [FMBench: Adaptive Large Language Model Output Formatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06384)
*Yaoting Wang,Yun Zhou,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对LLM生成Markdown格式内容易出错的问题，本文提出FMBench基准测试和结合监督微调与强化学习的对齐方法，实验证实该方法能提升格式合规性，但揭示了语义与结构目标间的内在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成满足语义意图和格式约束的输出方面存在不足，特别是Markdown格式（ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines），容易出现难以检测的结构错误（如列表断裂、表格错误、标题不一致、代码块无效），影响下游可用性。现有硬性解码约束方法不够灵活。

Method: 构建FMBench基准评估真实场景下的Markdown格式化能力；提出两阶段对齐流程：先基于指令-响应对进行监督微调(SFT)，再通过强化学习优化兼顾语义保真度与结构正确性的复合目标函数。

Result: 在OpenPangu和Qwen模型族上，SFT显著提升语义对齐，RL在此基础上进一步增强对复杂Markdown指令的鲁棒性；实验揭示了语义与结构目标存在固有trade-off。

Conclusion: 精心设计奖励函数对可靠格式化生成至关重要；SFT+RL组合策略有效提升Markdown合规性，但需在语义保真与结构正确间谨慎权衡。

Abstract: Producing outputs that satisfy both semantic intent and format constraints is essential for deploying large language models in user-facing and system-integrated workflows. In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

### [19] [Stopping Computation for Converged Tokens in Masked Diffusion-LM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06412)
*Daisuke Oba,Danushka Bollegala,Masahiro Kaneko,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SureLock improves masked diffusion language models by locking stable token positions to skip redundant computations, reducing FLOPs by 30-50% while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion language models suffer from computational inefficiency because they recompute attention and feed-forward operations for all tokens at every sampling step, even for tokens that have already stabilized and are effectively fixed.

Method: SureLock introduces a "locking" mechanism: when a token's posterior distribution stabilizes (detected via local KL divergence), its query and feed-forward sublayers are skipped for future steps, while its attention keys and values are cached to allow other tokens to attend to it. This reduces per-iteration complexity from O(N²d) to O(MNd) where M is the decreasing number of unlocked positions.

Result: On LLaDA-8B, SureLock achieves 30-50% algorithmic FLOP reduction compared to baseline samplers with no quality degradation. Theoretical analysis proves that monitoring only local KL at lock step suffices to bound deviation in final token probabilities.

Conclusion: SureLock provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective method for accelerating masked diffusion language models by identifying and locking stable token positions, dramatically reducing computational waste without sacrificing generation quality.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models generate sequences via iterative sampling that progressively unmasks tokens. However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities. Our code will be available at https://daioba.github.io/surelock .

### [20] [On the Wings of Imagination: Conflicting Script-based Multi-role Framework for Humor Caption Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06423)
*Wenbo Shang,Yuxi Sun,Jing Ma,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents HOMER, a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework based on GTVH theory for generating funny image captions. The framework employs three specialized LLM roles (script-opposition extractor, retrieval-augmented imaginator, and caption generator) to overcome limitations of existing humor generation methods, demonstrating superior performance on New Yorker Cartoon benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal humor generation, particularly funny image captioning, presents significant challenges for LLMs requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, and creative imagination. Existing LLM approaches using reasoning chains or self-improvement suffer from limited creativity and interpretability, creating a need for more theoretically grounded and structured humor generation methods.

Method: The authors developed HOMER, a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism grounded in the General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH). The framework features three collaborative LLM roles: (1) a conflicting-script extractor that identifies key script oppositions for humor grounding, (2) a retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that expands creative space through structured imagination trees, and (3) a caption generator that produces diverse humorous captions based on the extracted knowledge and expanded associations.

Result: Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets demonstrate that HOMER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and powerful LLM reasoning strategies in multi-modal humor captioning tasks, establishing new performance standards for humor generation quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The HOMER framework successfully addresses critical bottlenecks in humor generation by integrating established humor theory (GTVH) with multi-role LLM collaboration and retrieval augmentation. This approach provides both enhanced creativity and interpretability, offering a theoretically sound solution for multi-modal humor generation that advances the field beyond current heuristic-based LLM methods.

Abstract: Humor is a commonly used and intricate human language in daily life. Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets show that HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and powerful LLM reasoning strategies on multi-modal humor captioning.

*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Ruizhi Qian,Minda Zhao,Weiyue Li,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a history-aware reinforcement learning framework for jailbreaking LLMs, using attention mechanisms to reweight vulnerability signals from prior interactions, achieving state-of-the-art success rates with higher query efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreaking methods fail to effectively utilize vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. The sequential nature of jailbreaking makes reinforcement learning a natural but underutilized framework.

Method: The authors introduce a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that incorporates historical information and an attention-based reweighting mechanism to highlight critical vulnerabilities within interaction history, guiding more efficient exploration.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance on AdvBench and HarmBench while significantly improving query efficiency compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: Leveraging historical vulnerability signals is crucial for effective RL-driven jailbreak strategies, providing a principled approach for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to many domains, making their safety a critical priority. Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies a critical LLM weakness: while models excel at recognizing related semantic pairs (86.5-100% accuracy), they catastrophically fail at identifying unrelated pairs (0-41.35% accuracy) despite high confidence, revealing systematic "semantic collapse" and severe calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations overlook the ability to distinguish genuine unrelatedness from meaningful semantic relations, creating a blind spot in assessing model reliability and safety.

Method: Introduces CORE (Comprehensive Ontological Relation Evaluation): a large-scale dataset of 225K MCQs across 74 disciplines, plus a rigorously validated open-source benchmark of 203 questions covering 24 relation types with balanced unrelated pairs (Cohen's κ=1.0).

Result: 29 SOTA LLMs show near-human performance on related pairs (86.5-100%) but severe degradation on unrelated pairs (0-41.35%) with high confidence (92-94%), 2-4x higher calibration error, 37.6% semantic collapse rate, and ~2% accuracy on domain-specific CORE-225K.

Conclusion: Unrelatedness reasoning represents a critical, under-evaluated frontier for LLM safety, exposing systematic failures in semantic understanding that demand urgent attention in model evaluation and development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on many reasoning benchmarks, yet existing evaluations rarely assess their ability to distinguish between meaningful semantic relations and genuine unrelatedness. We introduce CORE (Comprehensive Ontological Relation Evaluation), a dataset of 225K multiple-choice questions spanning 74 disciplines, together with a general-domain open-source benchmark of 203 rigorously validated questions (Cohen's Kappa = 1.0) covering 24 semantic relation types with equal representation of unrelated pairs. A human baseline from 1,000+ participants achieves 92.6% accuracy (95.1% on unrelated pairs). In contrast, 29 state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 48.25-70.9% overall accuracy, with near-ceiling performance on related pairs (86.5-100%) but severe degradation on unrelated pairs (0-41.35%), despite assigning similar confidence (92-94%). Expected Calibration Error increases 2-4x on unrelated pairs, and a mean semantic collapse rate of 37.6% indicates systematic generation of spurious relations. On the CORE 225K MCQs dataset, accuracy further drops to approximately 2%, highlighting substantial challenges in domain-specific semantic reasoning. We identify unrelatedness reasoning as a critical, under-evaluated frontier for LLM evaluation and safety.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework ClinMPO aligns light LLMs with psychiatric reasoning using evidence-based reward models, achieving diagnostic accuracy surpassing medical students on complex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Light-parameter LLMs are essential for privacy-preserving clinical deployment in psychiatry, but existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic, causing hallucinations and superficial reasoning that misalign with professional diagnostic cognition.

Method: ClinMPO framework uses reinforcement learning with a specialized reward model trained independently on 4,474 psychiatry journal articles structured by evidence-based medicine principles to align LLM internal reasoning with professional psychiatric practice.

Result: The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved 31.4% diagnostic accuracy on a reasoning-isolated benchmark, surpassing the 30.8% accuracy of 300 medical students on complex cases where large-parameter LLMs fail.

Conclusion: Medical evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to master complex psychiatric reasoning, demonstrating that explicit cognitive alignment provides a scalable approach to reliable and safe psychiatric decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential for medical decision support yet their application in psychiatry remains constrained by hallucinations and superficial reasoning. This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students. The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 31.4% and surpassed the human benchmark of 30.8% on these complex cases. These results demonstrate that medical evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to master complex reasoning tasks. Our findings suggest that explicit cognitive alignment offers a scalable pathway to reliable and safe psychiatric decision support.

TL;DR: 提出RelayGen，一种训练无关的片段级模型切换框架，通过离线分析token概率边界识别难度变化，在推理时动态将低难度片段切换到小模型，实现高达2.2倍加速且准确率损失小于2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成多步推理轨迹时存在显著的计算成本，且生成难度在单个输出内部存在变化，但现有方法要么忽略这种内部变化，要么需要复杂的有监督token级路由。

Method: 通过离线分析token概率边界来识别模型特定的切换信号，在推理时进行片段级模型切换：高难度推理保留在大模型，低难度片段动态委托给小模型，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个推理基准上显著降低推理延迟，保持大模型大部分准确率；与推测解码结合可实现2.2倍端到端加速，准确率下降<2%。

Conclusion: 首次证明片段级粗粒度控制足以捕捉推理难度变化，为高效长文本推理提供了简单有效的系统级解决方案，无需复杂路由或训练开销。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long, multi-step reasoning trajectories, but inference-time scaling incurs substantial deployment cost. A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present \textbf{RelayGen}, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory. RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models. When combined with speculative decoding, RelayGen achieves up to 2.2$\times$ end-to-end speedup with less than 2\% accuracy degradation, without requiring additional training or learned routing components.

TL;DR: ...


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ...

Method: ...

Result: ...

Conclusion: ...

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models generate by iteratively filling masked tokens over multiple denoising steps, so learning only from a terminal reward on the final completion yields coarse credit assignment over intermediate decisions. We propose DiSPO (Diffusion-State Policy Optimization), a plug-in credit-assignment layer that directly optimizes intermediate filling decisions. At selected intermediate masked states, DiSPO branches by resampling fillings for the currently masked positions from rollout-cached logits, scores the resulting completions, and updates only the newly filled tokens -- without additional multi-step diffusion rollouts. We formalize a fixed-state objective for branched completions and derive a policy-gradient estimator that can be combined with terminal-feedback policy optimization using the same rollouts. On LLaDA-8B-Instruct, DiSPO consistently improves over the terminal-feedback diffu-GRPO baseline on math and planning benchmarks under matched rollout compute and optimizer steps. Our code will be available at https://daioba.github.io/dispo .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型的数据与参数扩展范式受困于高质量数据稀缺与计算成本边际效益递减。尽管用户交互日志蕴含真实人类反馈与过程性知识，但其非结构化、噪声特性以及离策略优化问题，导致传统系统难以有效利用。亟需统一框架以系统化地从噪声日志中提取信号并实现模型持续优化。

Result: 在多项实验中，UNO展现出顶尖的效能与效率，显著优于检索增强生成(RAG)及基于记忆的方法，验证了其在真实部署场景下利用用户日志进行持续学习的有效性。

Conclusion: UNO为大模型系统在真实世界部署中从噪声用户日志持续学习提供了系统化解决方案，通过结构化蒸馏、异质性聚类与认知差距量化，实现了反馈信号的精准提取与策略优化的有效对齐，为LLM系统的迭代进化开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Scaling training data and model parameters has long driven progress in large language models (LLMs), but this paradigm is increasingly constrained by the scarcity of high-quality data and diminishing returns from rising computational costs. As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines.

### [27] [Revisiting the Shape Convention of Transformer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06471)
*Feng-Ting Liao,Meng-Hsi Chen,Guan-Ting Yi,Da-shan Shiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose replacing conventional narrow-wide-narrow FFNs in Transformers with deeper hourglass-shaped FFNs (wide-narrow-wide), showing they outperform or match conventional designs across scales while enabling better parameter allocation under fixed budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent results show residual hourglass MLPs have superior function approximation capabilities, challenging the long-standing narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention in Transformers where most parameters are allocated to the expansion MLP.

Method: Develop a Transformer variant that replaces conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN comprising stacked hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways, testing the hypothesis that deeper but lighter hourglass FFNs can serve as competitive alternatives.

Result: Hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M parameters and achieve comparable performance at 1B+ parameters; hourglass variants reallocating parameters from FFN to attention show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets.

Conclusion: The findings prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the attention/FFN parameter balance, suggesting deeper hourglass FFNs enable more efficient and expressive modern language models under fixed computational budgets.

Abstract: Dense Transformer language models have largely adhered to one consistent architectural shape: each layer consists of an attention module followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) with a narrow-wide-narrow MLP, allocating most parameters to the MLP at expansion ratios between 2 and 4. Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.

Method: 提出DREAM：基于对立初始立场与迭代相互批判的多轮辩论式相关性评估框架，通过LLM智能体间的协商一致机制，对确定性案例实现精确标注，对不确定性案例触发可靠人工升级

Result: 达到95.2%标注准确率，人工参与仅3.5%；构建BRIDGE基准，发现29,824个遗漏相关片段；重新评估显示未标注漏洞扭曲检索器排序并引发检索-生成失准，影响RAG系统评估有效性

Conclusion: 辩论式LLM评估框架显著提升IR基准质量，缓解评估偏差，为检索器公平比较与RAG系统优化提供更可靠的数据基础；框架与数据集已开源

Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) evaluation remains challenging due to incomplete IR benchmark datasets that contain unlabeled relevant chunks. While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment. The relevance assessment framework is available at https: //github.com/DISL-Lab/DREAM-ICLR-26; and the BRIDGE dataset is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/BRIDGE-Benchmark.

*Himanshu Singh,Ziwei Xu,A. V. Subramanyam,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对性的子空间干预策略，通过在LLM的隐藏表示中识别并抑制有毒模式，在保持文本流畅性的同时显著降低生成内容的毒性，在RealToxicityPrompts基准上优于现有基线方法，且对推理复杂度影响极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在生成有毒内容的严重安全问题，但现有方法面临两大挑战：一是毒性具有微妙性和上下文依赖性，难以在token或句子层面检测；二是安全缓解措施往往以牺牲生成文本的连贯性和流畅性为代价，存在明显的性能权衡。

Method: 采用子空间干预策略，在模型表示层面定位并抑制隐藏的有毒模式，而非依赖表面层的token或句子信号。该方法通过有针对性的表示空间操作，分离并消除毒性相关特征，同时保留生成安全流畅内容的能力。

Result: 在RealToxicityPrompts基准测试中实现强缓解性能：跨多个LLM将有现有解毒系统的毒性降低8-20%，同时保持相当的流畅性；与基线相比实现有效毒性减少且不损害生成性能，推理复杂度增加极小。

Conclusion: 该子空间干预方法成功解决了LLM安全性与流畅性的权衡问题，通过表示层面的精细操作实现了有效且高效的毒性缓解，为LLM安全对齐提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful text generators, yet they can produce toxic or harmful content even when given seemingly harmless prompts. This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that our approach achieves effective toxicity reduction without impairing generative performance, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: FairJudge通过可学习策略建模和课程式SFT-DPO-GRPO训练解决LLM-as-a-Judge的适应性、偏见和不一致性问题，在减少非语义偏见的同时性能超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-Judge系统在任务/领域适应性、非语义线索（位置、长度、格式、模型来源）导致的系统性偏见以及跨模式不一致性方面存在局限，影响评估可靠性。

Method: 提出FairJudge，将评判行为建模为可学习的正则化策略。构建具有明确行为监督的高信息密度数据集，采用课程式SFT-DPO-GRPO训练，在不遗忘的前提下逐步对齐评分标准遵循、偏见缓解和跨模式一致性。

Result: 在多个内部和公开基准测试中，FairJudge持续提升一致性和F1分数，减少非语义偏见，性能显著优于更大的指令微调大模型。

Conclusion: 该研究证明通过课程学习可实现自适应、去偏且一致的LLM评判。所有资源将在录用后公开，以促进可靠LLM评估研究。

Abstract: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge systems suffer from three fundamental limitations: limited adaptivity to task- and domain-specific evaluation criteria, systematic biases driven by non-semantic cues such as position, length, format, and model provenance, and evaluation inconsistency that leads to contradictory judgments across different evaluation modes (e.g., pointwise versus pairwise). To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on multiple internal and public benchmarks show that FairJudge consistently improves agreement and F1, reduces non-semantic biases, and outperforms substantially larger instruction-tuned LLMs. All resources will be publicly released after acceptance to facilitate future research.

*Steffen Freisinger,Philipp Seeberger,Tobias Bocklet,Korbinian Riedhammer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal topic segmentation model combining fine-tuned text and Siamese audio encoders to leverage acoustic boundary cues, achieving significant gains over baselines with enhanced robustness to ASR noise and cross-lingual effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current topic segmentation methods for spoken content underutilize acoustic features despite multi-topic spoken data (e.g., videos/podcasts) requiring segmentation for navigation; acoustic cues around sentence boundaries are critical but overlooked, limiting robustness and performance.

Method: Multi-modal fine-tuning of a text encoder and Siamese audio encoder to jointly learn textual and acoustic boundary representations; explicitly captures prosodic/acoustic cues (e.g., pauses, pitch shifts) near topic transitions using a large-scale YouTube video dataset.

Result: Substantial performance gains over text-only and existing multi-modal baselines; significantly more resilient to ASR transcription errors; outperforms larger text-only models on Portuguese, German, and English datasets, proving cross-lingual robustness of learned acoustic features.

Conclusion: Acoustic feature integration is essential for robust topic segmentation: learned boundary cues compensate for textual noise (e.g., ASR errors) and generalize across languages, demonstrating that audio signals provide complementary, language-agnostic segmentation signals beyond text analysis alone.

Abstract: Spoken content, such as online videos and podcasts, often spans multiple topics, which makes automatic topic segmentation essential for user navigation and downstream applications. However, current methods do not fully leverage acoustic features, leaving room for improvement. We propose a multi-modal approach that fine-tunes both a text encoder and a Siamese audio encoder, capturing acoustic cues around sentence boundaries. Experiments on a large-scale dataset of YouTube videos show substantial gains over text-only and multi-modal baselines. Our model also proves more resilient to ASR noise and outperforms a larger text-only baseline on three additional datasets in Portuguese, German, and English, underscoring the value of learned acoustic features for robust topic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM采用静态、一刀切的安全策略，缺乏运行时可控性，导致在多样化应用场景中难以平衡安全性与有用性（过度拒绝良性请求或约束不足有害请求）。

Method: 提出PACT框架：1) 采用分层策略架构（不可覆盖的全局安全政策+用户自定义域特定风险类别及行为）；2) 通过显式风险感知的思维链推理将安全决策分解为结构化"分类→执行"路径（合规/引导/拒绝），提升决策透明度。

Result: 实验表明：在全局政策评估下达到接近SOTA的安全性能，在用户特定政策评估下实现最佳可控性，有效缓解安全-有用性权衡问题。

Conclusion: PACT通过动态安全控制机制解决了静态策略的局限性，将开源模型套件、训练数据和评估协议以促进可控安全对齐研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental safety-helpfulness trade-off due to static, one-size-fits-all safety policies that lack runtime controllabilityxf, making it difficult to tailor responses to diverse application needs. %As a result, models may over-refuse benign requests or under-constrain harmful ones. We present \textbf{PACT} (Prompt-configured Action via Chain-of-Thought), a framework for dynamic safety control through explicit, risk-aware reasoning. PACT operates under a hierarchical policy architecture: a non-overridable global safety policy establishes immutable boundaries for critical risks (e.g., child safety, violent extremism), while user-defined policies can introduce domain-specific (non-global) risk categories and specify label-to-action behaviors to improve utility in real-world deployment settings. The framework decomposes safety decisions into structured Classify$\rightarrow$Act paths that route queries to the appropriate action (comply, guide, or reject) and render the decision-making process transparent.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PACT achieves near state-of-the-art safety performance under global policy evaluation while attaining the best controllability under user-specific policy evaluation, effectively mitigating the safety-helpfulness trade-off. We will release the PACT model suite, training data, and evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducible research in controllable safety alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型为情感自适应AI带来新机遇，但精确控制情感仍具挑战；现有方法资源消耗大，亟需一种资源敏感且易获取的替代方案。

Method: 采用Ekman六种基本情绪，使用gpt-3.5-turbo测试零样本、思维链等提示技术，并与微调方法对比，重点评估含人工示例的少样本提示效果。

Result: 提示工程能有效引导AI生成文本的情感倾向；其中，包含人工示例的少样本提示技术表现最佳，因其提供了更具体的任务指导。

Conclusion: 提示工程为情感自适应AI系统提供了实用且经济的实现路径，特别适用于数据受限环境，减少了对大规模标注数据和计算资源的需求。

Abstract: The groundbreaking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing human-computer interaction through emotion-adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, deliberately controlling the sentiment in these systems remains challenging. The present study investigates the potential of prompt engineering for controlling sentiment in LLM-generated text, providing a resource-sensitive and accessible alternative to existing methods. Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings. In this regard, Few-Shot prompting with human-written examples was the most effective among other techniques, likely due to the additional task-specific guidance. The findings contribute valuable insights towards developing emotion-adaptive AI systems.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示生成式奖励模型(GenRM)存在标签正确但推理失准的伪正确性问题，提出R-Align通过显式监督推理对齐来提升RLHF效果，在多任务上实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GenRM训练评估仅关注结果标签准确性，忽略推理质量与参考判断的一致性，导致奖励模型可能在保持高准确率的同时产生与黄金标准相悖的推理，进而影响RLHF对齐效果。

Method: 定义伪正确率(S-Corr)指标量化推理失准程度，提出R-Align方法：在训练中引入黄金判断并显式监督GenRM推理与参考推理的对齐，通过推理为中心的对齐提升 fidelity。

Result: 实证发现竞争性GenRM仍存在显著S-Corr，且高S-Corr与策略退化相关。R-Align有效降低基准测试中的伪正确率，在STEM、代码、指令遵循及通用任务上均带来持续性能增益。

Conclusion: 推理保真度是决定RLHF成败的关键因素，应超越传统标签准确率指标，将显式推理监督纳入奖励模型训练范式，以确保偏好决策与推理逻辑的一致性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains indispensable for aligning large language models (LLMs) in subjective domains. To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks.

*Kate Sanders,Nathaniel Weir,Sapana Chaudhary,Kaj Bostrom,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A data-driven method to automatically generate granular reasoning error taxonomies (rubrics) that significantly improve LLM's ability to detect errors in technical domains, enabling more effective LLM-as-judge reward functions for RL training with far fewer gold labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs cannot reliably identify errors in reasoning traces, especially in long outputs, expert-knowledge domains, and problems lacking verifiable rewards, limiting their effectiveness for reasoning verification and model training.

Method: Automatically constructing highly granular reasoning error taxonomies through a data-driven approach, then leveraging these rubrics for classification-based error detection and building specialized LLM-as-judge reward functions.

Result: Rubric-based classification achieves strong error identification in coding, math, and chemical engineering; the resulting reward functions improve model task accuracy by +45% over general LLM-as-judges, approaches verifiable reward performance while using only 20% of gold labels.

Conclusion: Extends reward rubrics from qualitative assessment to quantitative correctness evaluation, enabling training of models for complex technical problems without expensive full gold-label datasets.

Abstract: An impediment to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning output verification is that LLMs struggle to reliably identify errors in thinking traces, particularly in long outputs, domains requiring expert knowledge, and problems without verifiable rewards. We propose a data-driven approach to automatically construct highly granular reasoning error taxonomies to enhance LLM-driven error detection on unseen reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or "rubrics", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards. This extension opens the door for teaching models to solve complex technical problems without a full dataset of gold labels, which are often highly costly to procure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的视觉词义消歧框架，通过CLIP和双通道提示增强文本嵌入，在SemEval-2023数据集上MRR提升至0.7590，证明精确的CLIP对齐提示比嘈杂的外部信号更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言理解中长期面临词汇歧义挑战，本研究旨在探索如何通过视觉领域解决词汇歧义问题。

Method: 构建可解释的VWSD框架：使用CLIP将歧义文本和候选图像投影到共享多模态空间；通过语义和照片双通道提示结合WordNet同义词增强文本嵌入；采用鲁棒的测试时增强优化图像嵌入；最后通过余弦相似度匹配最佳图像。

Result: 在SemEval-2023 VWSD数据集上，增强嵌入使MRR从0.7227提升至0.7590，命中率从0.5810提升至0.6220。消融实验表明双通道提示提供强低延迟性能，而激进图像增强仅带来边际增益。

Conclusion: 精确的CLIP对齐提示对视觉词义消歧效果显著；WordNet定义和多语言提示等外部嘈杂信号会稀释语义特异性；该方法在保持低延迟的同时实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.

*Zhimin Hu,Lanhao Niu,Sashank Varma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes that conceptual representations share a stable geometric relational structure across tasks, even when embedded in distinct subspaces; this structure enables generalization while minimizing interference, as demonstrated through number representations in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A central debate in cognitive science concerns whether conceptual representations converge onto a shared manifold for generalization or diverge into orthogonal subspaces to minimize task interference. A mechanistic account of how these properties coexist remains elusive.

Method: Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as computational substrates, the authors investigated whether number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks, examining how task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces.

Result: Number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations reside in distinct subspaces with separable linear encodings for features like magnitude and parity. Crucially, these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating shared relational structure despite spatial separation.

Conclusion: The findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how language models balance shared conceptual structure with functional flexibility. Understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of concepts.

Abstract: A central question in cognitive science is whether conceptual representations converge onto a shared manifold to support generalization, or diverge into orthogonal subspaces to minimize task interference. While prior work has discovered evidence for both, a mechanistic account of how these properties coexist and transform across tasks remains elusive. We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations.

### [40] [SEMA: Simple yet Effective Learning for Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06854)
*Mingqian Feng,Xiaodong Liu,Weiwei Yang,Jialin Song,Xuekai Zhu,Chenliang Xu,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEMA is a two-stage framework for multi-turn jailbreak attacks that achieves 80.1% ASR on AdvBench by self-generating adversarial prompts and using intent-drift-aware reinforcement learning, without external data or victim feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn jailbreaks represent the real threat model for safety-aligned chatbots, but existing methods fail due to exploration complexity and intent drift, with single-turn attacks being insufficient as merely a special case.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Prefilling self-tuning stabilizes learning by fine-tuning on self-generated multi-turn adversarial prompts with minimal prefixes; (2) Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and detail level to anchor harmful intent, using an open-loop regime that unifies single- and multi-turn attacks while eliminating victim feedback dependency.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: 80.1% ASR@1 average across three models on AdvBench, representing a 33.9% improvement over previous SOTA, outperforming all single-turn, manual/template multi-turn, SFT, and DPO baselines across multiple datasets and judges.

Conclusion: SEMA provides a compact, reproducible, transferable method for automatic redteaming that offers a realistic stress test for LLM safety by exposing multi-turn jailbreak failure modes.

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreaks capture the real threat model for safety-aligned chatbots, where single-turn attacks are merely a special case. Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants. For instance, SEMA performs an average $80.1\%$ ASR@1 across three closed-source and open-source victim models on AdvBench, 33.9% over SOTA. The approach is compact, reproducible, and transfers across targets, providing a stronger and more realistic stress test for large language model (LLM) safety and enabling automatic redteaming to expose and localize failure modes.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多目标对齐中的交叉目标干扰现象，提出了局部协方差定律来解释该现象，并设计了协方差目标权重适应（CTWA）方法来有效缓解此问题，同时提供了全局收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多目标大型语言模型对齐过程中，训练往往只提升部分目标性能而导致其他目标退化，这种交叉目标干扰现象被形式化并首次系统性地研究，揭示了其普遍性和模型依赖性。

Method: 通过推导局部协方差定律，证明当目标奖励与标量化分数呈正协方差时该目标得以改进；将此分析扩展至现代对齐中的截断替代目标；提出CTWA方法维持目标奖励与训练信号间的正协方差；并在Polyak-Łojasiewicz条件下进行全局收敛分析。

Result: 发现协方差定律在截断条件下仍轻度成立，CTWA能有效缓解交叉目标干扰，揭示了非凸标量化优化的全局收敛条件及干扰与模型几何特性的关系。

Conclusion: 建立了非凸标量化优化全局收敛的理论框架，阐明了交叉目标干扰的模型几何依赖性，为多目标对齐提供了理论指导和实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study a persistent failure mode in multi-objective alignment for large language models (LLMs): training improves performance on only a subset of objectives while causing others to degrade. We formalize this phenomenon as cross-objective interference and conduct the first systematic study across classic scalarization algorithms, showing that interference is pervasive and exhibits strong model dependence.
  To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference. Finally, we complement these local improvement conditions with a global convergence analysis under the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition, establishing when non-convex scalarized optimization achieves global convergence and how cross-objective interference depends on specific model geometric properties.

### [42] [Halluverse-M^3: A multitask multilingual benchmark for hallucination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06920)
*Samir Abdaljalil,Parichit Sharma,Erchin Serpedin,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We introduce Halluverse-M^3, a multilingual dataset covering 4 languages and 2 generation tasks to systematically analyze LLM hallucinations across entity, relation, and sentence levels. Evaluation reveals QA is easier than dialogue summarization, sentence-level hallucinations are hardest, and performance degrades significantly in lower-resource languages like Hindi compared to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs remain a critical challenge, particularly in multilingual and generative contexts where factual consistency is difficult to maintain. While English-centric benchmarks show strong performance, cross-lingual, cross-task, and cross-category hallucination behavior is poorly understood, hindering systematic detection and mitigation research.

Method: Constructing Halluverse-M^3 through controlled editing of authentic outputs with human validation, covering English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish across question answering and dialogue summarization tasks. The dataset explicitly categorizes hallucinations at entity, relation, and sentence levels. Fine-grained evaluation of diverse open-source and proprietary LLMs on hallucination detection.

Result: Question answering consistently outperforms dialogue summarization in detection accuracy. Sentence-level hallucinations prove most challenging across all models. Performance exhibits strong language dependency: English achieves highest accuracy while lower-resource languages degrade significantly, with Hindi showing the lowest detection performance.

Conclusion: Halluverse-M^3 establishes a realistic, challenging benchmark for multilingual multi-task hallucination research. The dataset reveals critical gaps in current LLM capabilities across languages and hallucination types, providing a foundation for developing more robust detection and mitigation strategies in non-English settings.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models remain a persistent challenge, particularly in multilingual and generative settings where factual consistency is difficult to maintain. While recent models show strong performance on English-centric benchmarks, their behavior across languages, tasks, and hallucination types is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/sabdalja/HalluVerse-M3}.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个土耳其语子词分词综合性研究，系统探讨词汇表-语料库-性能关系，比较不同分词器在形态丰富语言上的效果，提供形态感知诊断工具和开源资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形态丰富语言（如土耳其语）中，子词分词对神经语言建模至关重要，但现有研究存在三方面不足：未系统控制分词器训练语料、缺乏内在诊断指标、下游任务评估范围狭窄。

Method: 提出"子词清单"研究框架，联合变化词汇表大小和训练语料规模，在匹配参数量下对比WordPiece、形态级和字符级分词器，通过语义（NLI、STS、情感分析、NER）、句法（POS、依存分析）和形态敏感探针进行评估，并引入形态感知诊断工具包（边界级F1、词元原子性、过/欠分割指数、字符/词错误率、延续率、词缀覆盖率等）。

Result: 实现四大贡献：1）系统性揭示词汇表大小、训练语料与性能的三元关系；2）建立统一的形态感知评估框架，连接内在诊断与外在表现；3）通过控制实验明确字符级和形态级分词器的适用场景；4）开源评估代码、分词器管道和模型。

Conclusion: 为形态丰富语言的分词器设计提供实践指导，建立可复现的研究基础，推动未来相关研究。

Abstract: Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a "subwords manifest", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this "subwords manifest" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.

*Lizhuo Luo,Zhuoran Shi,Jiajun Luo,Zhi Wang,Shen Ren,Wenya Wang,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAWN exploits token dependency graphs for aggressive parallel decoding in diffusion LLMs, achieving 1.80-8.06x speedup with negligible quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conservative dLLM parallel decoding underexplores efficiency due to unmodeled semantic dependencies between tokens.

Method: Training-free approach using dependency graphs to selectively unmask reliable positions while avoiding strongly coupled uncertain positions simultaneously.

Result: 1.80-8.06x speedup over baselines across models/datasets with preserved generation quality.

Conclusion: Dependency-aware decoding substantially accelerates dLLM inference without quality degradation or retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown advantages in text generation, particularly due to their inherent ability for parallel decoding. However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

*Yuchen Yan,Liang Jiang,Jin Jiang,Shuaicheng Li,Zujie Wen,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou,Jian Shao,Yueting Zhuang,Yongliang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for iterative reasoning that learns optimal summarization strategies, achieving 21% accuracy gains on AIME24 while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from quadratic inference costs, context length limits, and lost-in-the-middle effects. Existing iterative reasoning methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and cannot optimize key decisions about summarization timing, content preservation, and reasoning resumption.

Method: InftyThink+ is a two-stage framework combining supervised cold-start with trajectory-level reinforcement learning. It uses model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization to optimize the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions.

Result: On DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24, outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning, generalizes better to out-of-distribution benchmarks, reduces inference latency, and accelerates RL training.

Conclusion: InftyThink+ successfully optimizes iterative reasoning through reinforcement learning, demonstrating both stronger performance and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-in-the-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes NanoNet, a lightweight text mining framework that uses online knowledge distillation and mutual learning regularization to achieve parameter-efficient learning with minimal labeled data and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior lightweight semi-supervised learning methods using knowledge transfer from large to small models are computationally intensive and prone to local optima. The authors investigate three low-cost scenarios for text mining: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models.

Method: The authors propose NanoNet, which implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision by employing online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhancing their performance through mutual learning regularization.

Result: The approach reduces training costs, minimizes supervision requirements, and yields a lightweight model suitable for downstream inference.

Conclusion: NanoNet provides an effective solution for lightweight text mining by combining parameter-efficient learning, online knowledge distillation, and mutual learning regularization to overcome the limitations of prior LSL methods.

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

*Purbak Sengupta,Sambeet Mishra,Sonal Shreya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm for wind power ramp events that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs power trajectories using enhanced RBAθ representation, wavelet decomposition, and deep learning, enabling zero-shot transfer to unseen wind farms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects, and traditional trajectory-first approaches that infer events from dense forecasts have limited generalization across sites.

Method: Built on enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBAθ) method, progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models; introduces event-first deep architecture with wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection; includes agentic forecasting layer for dynamic workflow selection.

Result: Ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands; enables stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms; direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations.

Conclusion: Event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.

Abstract: Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects. This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_θ$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.

### [48] [Toward Faithful and Complete Answer Construction from a Single Document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06103)
*Zhaoyang Chen,Cody Fleming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EVE, a structured document-grounded reasoning framework that decomposes LLM generation into extraction, validation, and enumeration phases to simultaneously improve recall and precision while breaking the coverage-accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs' statistical next-token prediction design biases toward high-probability continuations, causing omissions (incompleteness) and hallucinations (unfaithfulness), which fundamentally conflicts with AI safety principles requiring rigorous grounding in source content.

Method: EVE constrains free-form generation via a verifiable pipeline: 1) Extraction: identify relevant entities/facts from source documents; 2) Validation: assess each extracted item for correctness and completeness; 3) Enumeration: systematically generate answers from validated items, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

Result: Achieves up to 24% improvement in recall, 29% in precision, and 31% in F1-score, effectively breaking the traditional coverage-accuracy trade-off and mitigating length-induced truncation. Demonstrates performance saturation reflecting inherent natural language ambiguity.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning frameworks like EVE offer a principled approach for high-rigor tasks requiring completeness and faithfulness, though fundamental limits exist due to linguistic ambiguity; represents a safety-aligned alternative to single-pass generation.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程与科学工作流依赖昂贵的黑盒评估，需要同时提升性能并减少不确定性；贝叶斯优化(BO)与贝叶斯实验设计(BED)在目标寻求与信息寻求方面能力强大但长期分离，对学习与优化内在耦合的混合场景缺乏有效指导。

Method: 提出源于主动推理的"务实好奇心"混合学习优化范式，通过最小化预期自由能选择动作，该目标函数耦合了实用效用与认知信息增益。

Result: 在约束系统识别、目标主动搜索、未知偏好的复合优化等现实混合任务上，持续优于BO类和BED类基线，获得更高的估计精度、更好的关键区域覆盖率和更优的最终解质量。

Conclusion: 务实好奇心在混合学习优化问题中具有实际有效性和灵活性，能够成功应对学习与优化内在耦合的场景。

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

Motivation: 大型语言模型计算需求高，现有剪枝方法局限于单一维度（深度或宽度），缺乏统一框架。

Method: MoP（Mixture of Pruners）通过迭代生成深度和宽度两条剪枝分支，动态选择最优候选路径，实现双维度结构化剪枝。

Result: ①在LLaMA-2/3上全面超越SOTA方法；②显著优于单维度剪枝；③40%压缩率下延迟降低39%；④成功扩展至LLaVA-1.5并提升效率；⑤文本-only微调可恢复视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: MoP通过统一双维度剪枝，在语言与视觉-语言模型上均实现更优的压缩率-精度权衡和真实加速效果，展现了良好的泛化性。

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that forecasts building-level climate risks by integrating heterogeneous urban data with transportation network accessibility signals for intelligent vehicle routing and emergency response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency operations by damaging infrastructure and reducing network accessibility, creating a need for predictive models that incorporate transportation-relevant signals for intelligent vehicle dispatch.

Method: Skjold-DiT combines three components: (1) Fjell-Prompt for cross-city transfer via prompt-based conditioning, (2) Norrland-Fusion using cross-modal attention to unify hazard maps, building attributes, demographics, and infrastructure, and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast as a counterfactual simulator for probabilistic risk trajectories. It employs a diffusion-transformer architecture trained on the novel BCUR dataset containing 847,392 building-level observations across six cities.

Result: The framework produces calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, route redundancy) that enable hazard-conditioned routing constraints for intelligent vehicles. Experiments evaluate prediction quality, cross-city generalization, calibration, and downstream transportation outcomes including emergency reachability and intervention scenarios.

Conclusion: Skjold-DiT provides a comprehensive approach to climate-risk forecasting by explicitly modeling transportation network effects, demonstrating potential for real-world deployment in emergency dispatch and evacuation planning systems.

Abstract: Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency-response operations by damaging housing stock, degrading infrastructure, and reducing network accessibility. This paper presents Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that integrates heterogeneous spatio-temporal urban data to forecast building-level climate-risk indicators while explicitly incorporating transportation-network structure and accessibility signals relevant to intelligent vehicles (e.g., emergency reachability and evacuation-route constraints). Concretely, Skjold-DiT enables hazard-conditioned routing constraints by producing calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, and route redundancy) that can be consumed by intelligent-vehicle routing and emergency dispatch systems. Skjold-DiT combines: (1) Fjell-Prompt, a prompt-based conditioning interface designed to support cross-city transfer; (2) Norrland-Fusion, a cross-modal attention mechanism unifying hazard maps/imagery, building attributes, demographics, and transportation infrastructure into a shared latent representation; and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast, a counterfactual simulator for generating probabilistic risk trajectories under intervention prompts. We introduce the Baltic-Caspian Urban Resilience (BCUR) dataset with 847,392 building-level observations across six cities, including multi-hazard annotations (e.g., flood and heat indicators) and transportation accessibility features. Experiments evaluate prediction quality, cross-city generalization, calibration, and downstream transportation-relevant outcomes, including reachability and hazard-conditioned travel times under counterfactual interventions.

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTA评估假设无限处理时间，忽略精度-时延权衡，无法反映时敏部署中预测延迟导致价值丧失的现实约束。

Method: 构建含时序场景、评估协议和时间相关效用指标三大组件的框架，实例化离散效用（异步硬截止期限）、连续效用（交互式价值衰减）和摊销效用（预算约束）三种度量。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上对7种TTA方法的240次评估显示：传统SOTA方法ETA在41.2%评估中失效，最优方法随腐蚀类型和时延压力变化而无统一胜者。

Conclusion: Tempora首次实现跨时序约束的系统评估，揭示排名反转机制，为从业者提供方法选择依据，为研究者指明可部署适应的研究方向。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

### [55] [Optimistic Training and Convergence of Q-Learning -- Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06146)
*Prashant Mehta,Sean Meyn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that Q-learning with linear function approximation can have multiple solutions to the projected Bellman equation even under ideal basis conditions, demonstrating that far more structural assumptions are required for convergence than previously understood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent work established stability of Q-learning with linear function approximation under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy, it left open critical questions about uniqueness of solutions to the projected Bellman equation (PBE) and convergence criteria beyond standard tabular or linear MDP settings. This work aims to clarify these issues and extend results to other Q-learning variants.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis with counterexamples: (1) constructing a one-dimensional example to show that under oblivious training policies, the PBE may have no solution or multiple solutions while the algorithm becomes unstable; (2) presenting a case where the basis is ideal (true Q-function lies in its span) but still exhibits multiple PBE solutions under both greedy and $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policies for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$ and large $κ$.

Result: Key findings include: (i) Under oblivious policies, PBE may be unsolvable or have non-unique solutions, causing algorithm instability; (ii) Even with ideal basis functions that exactly span the true Q-function, multiple solutions to the PBE can exist under the greedy policy and persist for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; (iii) These results demonstrate that convergence requires significantly more structural regularity than previously assumed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that uniqueness of PBE solutions cannot be guaranteed even under ideal function approximation conditions, and the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy alone is insufficient to ensure convergence. Convergence of linearly approximated Q-learning fundamentally depends on stronger structural properties of the MDP and policy than those previously identified.

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

Motivation: 传统MoE模型存在专家全量执行的问题，导致精度-计算权衡呈现明显不连续性，无法实现细粒度的计算成本控制

Method: 设计嵌套式可伸缩专家结构，支持变宽度执行；提出多宽度训练策略与标准MoE目标结合；开发推理时宽度确定机制，包括轻量测试时训练将路由置信度映射到固定预算下的专家宽度

Conclusion: MoSE通过单一预训练模型支持连续精度-计算权衡，为动态计算需求提供了更高效灵活的解决方案

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

*Wei Wei,Yizhou Zeng,Kuntian Chen,Sophie Langer,Mariia Seleznova,Hung-Hsu Chou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether diffusion models' latent noise space contains class-relevant structure. By analyzing classifier confidence scores on generated samples, the authors discover that while the overall latent space appears unstructured, filtering for high-confidence samples reveals significant class separability, suggesting that latent structure exists but is only observable under confidence-based selection. This finding enables conditional generation without guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if the high-dimensional latent space of diffusion models contains structured information about generated sample properties (like classes), and to explore whether this structure can be harnessed for conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

Method: Generating samples from various noise seeds, assigning confidence scores using a pre-trained classifier, and analyzing the latent space structure across different confidence subsets. They compare class predictability across noise subsets with varying confidence levels to examine the emergence of class-relevant structure.

Result: The latent space shows pronounced class separability when restricted to high-confidence samples, despite appearing largely unstructured overall. This reveals that class-relevant latent structure exists but is only observable under confidence-based filtering.

Conclusion: Confidence-based filtering can enable conditional generation in diffusion models as an alternative to guidance-based methods, and that meaningful structure in the latent space is selectively revealed through confidence-based analysis.

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCONE integrates DNA encoding directly into neural compression's latent space using quaternary arithmetic coding with a constraint-aware module that dynamically enforces GC balance and homopolymer suppression during encoding, achieving near-perfect constraint satisfaction with minimal overhead (<2% latency).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural compression pipelines inefficiently convert learned latent representations to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding entropy model optimization and undermining compression efficiency while complicating the encoding stack.

Method: A plug-in module (SCONE) that performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on neural compression's latent space in DNA bases, using a Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module to dynamically steer the entropy encoder's probability distribution and enforce biochemical constraints deterministically during encoding.

Result: Achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), successfully collapsing latent compression and DNA encoding into a single reversible step.

Conclusion: Establishes a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs, providing efficient integration between neural compression and DNA storage.

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

Result: 在保持模型质量基准性能前提下，端到端训练速度提升1.4-1.7倍；方案适用于NVIDIA A100及后续GPU，可与量化、混合专家架构等技术叠加使用

Conclusion: 该稀疏训练方法有效突破FFN计算瓶颈，为大规模模型训练提供新优化路径，具备硬件兼容性和技术正交性，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

TL;DR: Proposes a min-max optimization-based federated unlearning framework that acts as a plugin for efficient data removal in FL, achieving speedups over retraining while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal/ethical requirements (right to be forgotten) and security needs (mitigating data poisoning) necessitate data unlearning in FL, but distributed architecture complicates individual data contribution removal compared to centralized settings.

Method: Formulates federated unlearning as a min-max optimization: maximize $f$-divergence between complete-data model and unlearned model while minimizing performance degradation on retained data, designed as architecture-agnostic plugin.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate significant computational speedups versus naive retraining with negligible utility loss.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently approximates data removal effects in distributed settings, providing a practical and scalable solution for compliance and security in federated learning systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

### [61] [Learning Rate Scaling across LoRA Ranks and Transfer to Full Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06204)
*Nan Chen,Soledad Villar,Soufiane Hayou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Maximal-Update Adaptation (μA), a theoretical framework that characterizes optimal learning rate scaling with adapter rank and model width in LoRA. It identifies two distinct regimes and enables learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, reducing hyperparameter tuning costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's training dynamics are complex and hyperparameter-sensitive, but the relationship between optimal learning rate and adapter rank remains unclear. Practitioners must manually re-tune learning rates when changing ranks, creating significant inefficiency in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large models.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework inspired by Maximal-Update Parametrization (μP), applying hyperparameter transfer techniques to derive how learning rates must scale with model width and adapter rank to maintain stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations.

Result: Analysis reveals two scaling regimes: (1) a rank-invariant regime where optimal learning rate remains stable across ranks, and (2) an inverse scaling regime where learning rate decreases with rank. Critically, the authors identify a configuration that enables direct learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning.

Conclusion: μA provides principled, validated scaling rules for LoRA hyperparameters that eliminate per-rank learning rate tuning and enable cost-effective transfer to full finetuning, as demonstrated across language, vision, vision-language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent empirical evidence shows large-scale deep neural networks train in low-dimensional subspaces, but theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited compared to deep linear settings.

Method: Analyzes MLP learning dynamics under gradient descent, theoretically characterizes invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, and validates experimentally beyond these assumptions.

Result: Demonstrates weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training; shows low-rank MLP parameterizations initialized in appropriate subspaces match full-parameterization classification performance across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for low-dimensional training dynamics in nonlinear networks, enabling more efficient low-rank training, compression, and adaptation methods.

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has demonstrated that the training dynamics of large-scale deep neural networks occur within low-dimensional subspaces. While this has inspired new research into low-rank training, compression, and adaptation, theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited. %compared to deep linear settings. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.

Conclusion: SR4-Fit成功解决了模型可解释性与预测性能之间的传统权衡问题，证明可解释模型可在匹配或超越黑盒性能的同时，为选举预测和通用分类任务提供稳定、可理解的规则集。

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

Conclusion: LLM模拟能够为复杂多智能体环境中的自动化游戏设计和平衡提供强大支持，标志着AI驱动游戏开发的重要进展。

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

*Adam Barla,Emanuele Nevali,Luca Viano,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEPO is a single-step DPO-like algorithm that mitigates over-optimization in preference learning by ensembling policies trained on disjoint data subsets and aggregating via worst-case construction, achieving better sample complexity with single-policy concentrability while retaining DPO's practical simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决偏好学习中的过度优化问题，该问题影响DPO等现有算法。传统方法需要数据生成分布知识或显式奖励模型，而PEPO旨在无需这些条件的情况下实现悲观估计以避免过度乐观。

Method: 提出PEPO算法：1）在互不相交的数据子集上训练多个偏好优化策略构成集成；2）通过最坏情况构建（worst case construction）进行聚合，使模型更倾向于跨模型的一致性；3）采用单步DPO式训练保持实用性。该方法通过集成学习和悲观机制实现避免过度优化。

Result: 理论：在表格设置下，PEPO的样本复杂度仅依赖于单策略集中系数（single-policy concentrability），优于DPO等算法所需的全策略集中系数，从而避免了过度优化。实践：在保持DPO训练简洁性和实用性的同时，实现了令人信服的性能表现。

Conclusion: PEPO成功缓解了偏好学习中的过度优化问题，在理论上提供了更优的样本复杂度保证，在实践中保持了DPO-style训练的简洁性，是一种兼具理论优势与实践可行性的新算法。

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

### [66] [ATEX-CF: Attack-Informed Counterfactual Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06240)
*Yu Zhang,Sean Bin Yang,Arijit Khan,Cuneyt Gurcan Akcora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework ATEX-CF unifies adversarial attacks and counterfactual explanations for GNNs by combining edge additions and deletions to generate minimal, interpretable changes that flip predictions while maintaining fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual explanations for GNNs only consider edge deletions, while adversarial attacks typically use edge additions. This separation limits explanation quality, despite both approaches sharing the goal of flipping node predictions, suggesting potential synergy.

Method: ATEX-CF integrates adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation, enabling both edge additions and deletions. It jointly optimizes fidelity (correctness), sparsity (minimal changes), and plausibility (realistic modifications) under a constrained perturbation budget.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible instance-level explanations, validating the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: Unifying adversarial attacks and counterfactual explanations provides a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for GNN interpretability, producing high-quality explanations that are minimal, realistic, and effective at revealing model decision logic.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations offer an intuitive way to interpret graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying minimal changes that alter a model's prediction, thereby answering "what must differ for a different outcome?". In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.

### [67] [REBEL: Hidden Knowledge Recovery via Evolutionary-Based Evaluation Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06248)
*Patryk Rybak,Paweł Batorski,Paul Swoboda,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals that current LLM unlearning methods fail to truly erase sensitive data, as standard evaluation metrics miss residual knowledge recoverable via adversarial prompts; introducing REBEL, an evolutionary prompt generator that exposes up to 93% knowledge recovery rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning evaluation relies on benign queries that conflate superficial suppression with genuine knowledge removal, failing to detect residual sensitive/copyrighted data extractable via sophisticated prompting strategies.

Method: Proposes REBEL, an evolutionary adversarial prompt generation framework that actively probes unlearned models through iterative prompt optimization to recover seemingly forgotten knowledge.

Result: REBEL achieves 60% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on TOFU and 93% ASR on WMDP benchmarks, significantly outperforming static baselines and demonstrating widespread failure of existing unlearning algorithms to fully erase data.

Conclusion: Standard unlearning methods provide only superficial protection; true knowledge removal requires robust evaluation beyond benign queries, necessitating adoption of adversarial testing frameworks like REBEL for reliable unlearning validation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

### [68] [Steering Safely or Off a Cliff? Rethinking Specificity and Robustness in Inference-Time Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06256)
*Navita Goyal,Hal Daumé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a three-dimensional specificity framework (general, control, robustness) for evaluating model steering and finds that while steering effectively controls target behaviors and preserves general/control properties, it consistently fails robustness specificity by increasing safety vulnerabilities like jailbreak susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model steering is a lightweight alternative to finetuning for controlling LLMs, but current evaluations don't adequately assess whether interventions cause unintended behavioral changes, particularly under distribution shifts, which is critical for safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposes a specificity framework with three dimensions—general (fluency/unrelated abilities), control (related properties), and robustness (maintaining properties under distribution shifts)—and evaluates two safety-critical cases: reducing overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations using hidden representation interventions.

Result: Steering methods achieve high efficacy and preserve general and control specificity, but all tested methods consistently fail robustness specificity; for overrefusal steering specifically, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks without harming general abilities or refusal of harmful queries.

Conclusion: Standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient for safe deployment; robustness evaluation is essential because current steering methods can appear reliable while actually compromising model safety, creating false confidence in their reliability.

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

### [69] [On Randomized Algorithms in Online Strategic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06257)
*Chase Hutton,Adam Melrod,Han Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线策略分类问题，在可實現設定下為隨機算法提供了首個適用於所有學習器的下界並提出了改進的隨機學習算法；在任意分布設定下通過凸優化技術將後悔值上界改進至接近最優的O(√T log|H| + |H|log(T|H|))，並證明了其在proper學習器中的最優性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线策略分类中，智能體會策略性修改特徵以獲得有利預測（如以提高信用分數來獲取貸款批准）。現有研究對隨機算法在策略環境下的潛在優勢探索不足：在可實現設定下，隨機算法尚無已知下界；在任意分布設定下，最佳已知後悔值上界O(T^(3/4))遠遜於標準線上學習的O(√T)速率。因此，亟需開發適用於策略行為的隨機學習理論。

Method: 在可實現設定下，將確定性學習器的現有下界擴展至所有學習器（包括隨機算法），並設計首個隨機學習算法以改進確定性上界。在任意分布設定下，運用凸優化技術構建proper學習器，系統性地分析其後悔值上界，並通過下界論證驗證最優性。

Result: 可實現設定：1) 當T > Ldim(H)Δ²時，為所有學習器建立了Ω(Ldim(H)Δ)的下界，這是首個適用於隨機學習器的下界；2) 提出了首個隨機學習算法，其表現優於確定性上界O(Ldim(H)·ΔlogΔ)。任意分布設定：1) 提出proper學習器，將後悔值上界提升至O(√T log|H| + |H|log(T|H|))；2) 證明了對所有proper學習規則而言，該上界在對數因子意義下是最優的，故需採用improper學習才能進一步改進。

Conclusion: 隨機算法在策略分類的可實現設定中具有理論優勢，填補了該領域的下界空白。在任意分布設定下，proper學習器通過凸優化可達接近最優後悔值，但若要突破此瓶頸則必須借助improper學習機制。這些結果為設計更穩健的策略學習算法奠定了理論基礎。

Abstract: Online strategic classification studies settings in which agents strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictions. For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.
  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\log^{1/4}T|\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal H|})$.
  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ^2$, the existing lower bound $Ω(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal H) \cdot Δ\log Δ)$.
  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\sqrt{T \log |\mathcal{H}|} + |\mathcal{H}| \log(T|\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners. As such, improper learning is necessary to further improve regret guarantees.

### [70] [GRP-Obliteration: Unaligning LLMs With a Single Unlabeled Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06258)
*Mark Russinovich,Yanan Cai,Keegan Hines,Giorgio Severi,Blake Bullwinkel,Ahmed Salem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method using Group Relative Policy Optimization to remove safety constraints from AI models with minimal data (single unlabeled prompt) while preserving utility, outperforming existing techniques and generalizing to both language and image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment in AI models is fragile and can be compromised through post-deployment fine-tuning. Existing unalignment methods require extensive data curation and significantly degrade model utility, limiting their practical applicability. The paper aims to extend practical limits of unalignment by developing a more efficient, utility-preserving approach.

Method: The authors propose GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), which leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. The method requires only a single unlabeled prompt to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while maintaining their utility. The approach generalizes across language models and diffusion-based image generation systems.

Result: GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. It successfully unaligns models across fifteen 7-20B parameter models from families including GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen. The method preserves model utility and works across instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures, evaluated on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRP-Obliteration demonstrates that safety constraints can be effectively removed from AI models with minimal data requirements and minimal utility degradation, revealing significant vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches. The method's generalization to both language and image generation systems indicates a fundamental weakness in safety alignment robustness.

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

### [71] [Swap Regret Minimization Through Response-Based Approachability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06264)
*Ioannis Anagnostides,Gabriele Farina,Maxwell Fishelson,Haipeng Luo,Jon Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret using approachability framework and John ellipsoid preconditioning, achieving O(d^{3/2}√T) regret for general convex sets and O(d√T) for centrally symmetric sets, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swap regret minimization is fundamental for achieving non-manipulability against strategic adversaries and connects to correlated equilibrium concepts. The prior state-of-the-art algorithm suffered from highly suboptimal regret (Ω(d⁴√T)) and computationally intensive ellipsoid algorithm calls, creating a need for simpler, more efficient methods.

Method: Leverages the response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid to develop a new algorithm that simultaneously minimizes both linear and profile swap regret.

Result: Achieves O(d^{3/2}√T) linear swap regret for general convex sets and O(d√T) for centrally symmetric sets; establishes matching Ω(d√T) lower bound; shows Gordon et al.'s classic algorithm is existentially optimal but computationally inefficient; extends to polynomial dimension swap deviations.

Conclusion: Provides the first computationally efficient algorithm with near-optimal regret bounds, unifying and strengthening recent advances in equilibrium computation and online learning by demonstrating that optimal swap regret minimization is achievable in polynomial time for centrally symmetric sets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing different notions of swap regret in online optimization. These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $Ω(d^4 \sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.
  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $Ω(d \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

Motivation: 解决随机净化方法在对抗系统中存在的测试精度不可靠问题，以及当攻击者完全掌握系统随机性时导致的鲁棒性退化缺陷，需确保防御方法的确定性和可靠性

Method: 采用最小化噪声污染数据重建期望误差的分数模型学习数据分布结构；对输入样本在邻域内搜索最小化重建期望误差的净化样本；应用锐度感知最小化引导样本至误差景观平坦区域

Conclusion: 确定性净化通过映射样本至数据分布模态附近，结合锐度感知优化，实现可靠鲁棒性；理论证明小噪声极限下可恢复高斯平滑密度的局部最大化器

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

Motivation: 在隐私保护浏览器API和第三方Cookie淘汰的背景下，广告域中的转化预测模型无法获得点击与转化间的直接链接，只能观测到候选点击集合（归因集合），这导致传统监督学习方法失效。如何在缺乏明确标签的粗粒度信号下进行模型训练成为关键挑战。

Result: 理论层面：ERM的泛化误差界与先验信息量成比例，且对先验估计误差具有鲁棒性，即使归因集合间存在复杂依赖关系仍成立。实证层面：在标准数据集上的简单评估表明，该方法显著优于常见工业启发式算法，尤其在归因集合较大或重叠的情况下优势更明显。

Conclusion: 该无偏估计方法为隐私保护下的转化预测提供了原则性解决方案，兼具理论保证与实践有效性，为处理粗粒度监督信号开辟了新路径。

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

*Sahil Joshi,Agniva Chowdhury,Wyatt Bellinger,Amar Kanakamedala,Ekam Singh,Hoang Anh Duy Le,Aditya Desai,Anshumali Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOCKET, a soft Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) approach for sparse attention in long-context LLM inference, replacing hard bucket matches with probabilistic aggregation to improve token selection and achieving up to 1.5× higher throughput than FlashAttention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse attention is critical for scaling large language models to long contexts, but its effectiveness depends on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens. Hard LSH sparsification produces discrete collision signals that are poorly suited for ranking purposes, limiting its utility as a scoring mechanism.

Method: The paper proposes SOCKET (SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator), which replaces hard LSH bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation across hash tables. This transforms LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic into a principled scoring kernel, preserving stable relative ordering among top-k tokens without requiring ad-hoc voting mechanisms. Implementation includes a custom CUDA kernel for key scoring and Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention.

Result: SOCKET matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse model architectures. The system achieves up to 1.5× higher throughput compared to FlashAttention, demonstrating practical efficiency gains for long-context inference.

Conclusion: SOCKET provides a mathematically grounded and effective solution for sparse attention in long-context LLM inference, successfully elevating LSH from heuristic to principled scoring while delivering substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

### [75] [The Condensate Theorem: Transformers are O(n), Not $O(n^2)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06317)
*Jorge L. Ruiz Williams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Condensate Theorem proves attention sparsity is a learned topological property, enabling lossless sub-quadratic attention via dynamic manifold projection. This achieves 159x measured speedup (projected >1,200x at 1M tokens) and >99.9% cost reduction over Flash Attention while maintaining 100% output equivalence across multiple language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic O(n²) complexity of transformer attention is a major inference bottleneck. The paper challenges whether this cost is inherent to intelligence or merely an implementation artifact, seeking to achieve lossless attention without exhaustive pairwise computations.

Method: Empirical discovery of attention mass concentrating on a topological manifold, formalized as the Condensate Manifold defined by three components: Anchor positions, Window neighborhoods, and Dynamic Top-k selection. Proves that projecting any query onto this manifold yields exact equivalence with full attention. Maps this topology to a specialized hardware kernel.

Result: - Theoretical: Lossless parity with full attention (100% output equivalence) proven generally
- Empirical: Bit-exact token matching across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, Mistral on 1,500+ generated tokens
- Performance: 159x measured speedup (3.94ms vs 628ms at 131K tokens), projected >1,200x at 1M tokens, >99.9% inference cost reduction versus Flash Attention

Conclusion: Attention's quadratic bottleneck is not fundamental to intelligence but stems from naive full attention implementation. The learned topological structure of attention (the Condensate Manifold) enables theoretically principled, lossless efficiency gains.

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

*Aoi Yoshimura,Gouhei Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight online RL adaptation framework using Echo State Networks and Recursive Least Squares that enables rapid policy adaptation in non-stationary environments without backpropagation or pretraining, achieving stable performance within few control steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies trained in simulation suffer severe performance degradation when deployed in real-world due to non-stationary dynamics. Existing methods like Domain Randomization and meta-RL require extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational costs, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems.

Method: Integrates Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module to encode recent observation histories into latent context representations, with readout weights updated online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This reservoir computing approach enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or privileged information access.

Result: On CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe environment changes (periodic disturbances and extreme friction variations), the method significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within few control steps and handling intra-episode environment changes without policy reset.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally efficient and stable solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments, making it well-suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment where traditional methods are impractical due to computational constraints.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation often suffer from severe performance degradation when deployed in real-world environments due to non-stationary dynamics. While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy. Due to its computational efficiency and stability, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments and is well suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment.

### [77] [Don't Break the Boundary: Continual Unlearning for OOD Detection Based on Free Energy Repulsion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06331)
*Ningkang Peng,Kun Shao,Jingyang Mao,Linjing Qian,Xiaoqian Peng,Xichen Yang,Yanhui Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the conflict between Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection and machine unlearning in trustworthy AI deployment. It proposes TFER, a boundary-preserving unlearning framework that transforms target classes into OOD samples using a free energy-based Push-Pull mechanism, achieving precise unlearning while maintaining OOD discrimination capabilities without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying trustworthy AI requires both robust OOD detection for safety and flexible machine unlearning for privacy compliance. Current methods face a geometric contradiction: static OOD detectors rely on compact data manifolds, while traditional unlearning disrupts this structure, destroying anomaly discrimination when erasing classes.

Method: The authors define boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a conceptual shift: unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming target classes into OOD samples. The TFER framework implements this via a Push-Pull game based on free energy principle: pulling retained classes into low-energy ID manifolds while pushing forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximizing discriminative performance on retained classes and external OOD data. The framework demonstrates inherent structural stability, effectively resisting catastrophic forgetting without complex constraints, showing exceptional potential for continual unlearning tasks.

Conclusion: TFER resolves the fundamental conflict between OOD detection and unlearning by establishing a unique Push-Pull equilibrium that provides structural stability. This enables models to simultaneously maintain OOD discrimination capabilities while performing targeted class erasure, offering a promising solution for trustworthy AI deployment in open-world environments.

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究带乐队反馈的零和博弈对抗性学习，提出纯策略最大最小遗憾度量。针对无信息/有信息两种反馈模型，分别提出Tsallis-INF和Maximin-UCB算法，均获得O(c log T)游戏相关的对数遗憾界，并将结果推广至双线性博弈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中学习者常被迫面对未知对手且仅能获得乐队反馈（仅观测所选动作收益），此时外部遗憾存在Ω(√T)的理论下界。为突破此障碍，需探索新的学习目标与算法设计。

Method: 分析两种乐队反馈模型：无信息反馈（仅揭示收益）和有信息反馈（揭示收益及对手行动）。针对前者提出Tsallis-INF算法，后者设计Maximin-UCB算法，均基于游戏相关参数(c, c')实现实例相关遗憾界。进一步推广至双线性博弈，提出Tsallis-FTRL-SPM和Maximin-LinUCB算法。

Result: 无信息场景下Tsallis-INF实现O(c log T)实例相关遗憾，且信息论下界证明对c的依赖是必要的。有信息场景下Maximin-UCB实现O(c' log T)遗憾界，其中c'可能远小于c。两种结果均成功扩展至双线性博弈，获得类似的对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: 通过引入纯策略最大最小遗憾这一新度量，本文在带乐队反馈的零和博弈中实现了对数级亚线性遗憾，显著优于传统Ω(√T)下界。有信息反馈可获得更紧的界，为现实世界限制信息下的博弈学习提供了理论保证和实用算法。

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

TL;DR: 提出增强与重用特征深度森林(ERDF)框架，通过标签相关性特征增强和度量感知特征重用两个机制，提升标签分布学习性能并确保训练稳定性，在六个评估指标上优于对比算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签分布学习(LDL)需有效利用标签相关性进行预测。深度森林(DF)虽为不依赖反向传播的优秀树集成框架，但其在LDL领域的应用尚不成熟，现有方法缺乏对标签相关性的有效利用机制，亟需既能增强特征表示又能维持训练稳定性的解决方案

Method: 提出增强与重用特征深度森林(ERDF)，包含两个核心机制：1)利用标签相关性增强原始特征，使样本获得更全面的LDL任务信息；2)对验证集上表现劣于前一层的样本进行特征重用，防止噪声扩散并确保训练稳定性。该增强-重用模式通过特征验证和选择性重用来优化特征质量

Result: 所提方法在六个评估指标上均优于对比算法，验证了ERDF框架的有效性

Conclusion: ERDF成功将标签相关性利用与特征重用机制集成于深度森林框架中，通过增强-重用模式在提升特征表达的同时抑制了噪声传播，为标签分布学习提供了稳定且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further. Experiments show that our method outperforms other comparison algorithms on six evaluation metrics.

### [80] [Evaluating LLM-persona Generated Distributions for Decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06357)
*Jackie Baek,Yunhan Chen,Ziyu Chi,Will Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the utility of LLM-generated distributions for decision-making (LLM-SAA), demonstrating their practical value in low-data regimes while cautioning against decision-agnostic metrics like Wasserstein distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing whether LLM-simulated data (e.g., consumer willingness-to-pay distributions) reliably supports real-world business decisions like pricing or inventory optimization, particularly when empirical data is scarce.

Method: Evaluates LLM-generated distributions through decision-induced metrics across three canonical problems (assortment optimization, pricing, newsvendor), comparing outcomes against ground-truth benchmarks.

Result: LLM-generated distributions yield actionable decisions, especially under data scarcity; however, standard distributional metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance) poorly correlate with decision quality.

Conclusion: Decision-specific evaluation is critical for LLM-SAA validity; while LLMs offer scalable data generation for optimization, their utility depends on alignment with downstream decision objectives rather than statistical fidelity alone.

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

*Changmin Kang,Jihun Yun,Baekrok Shin,Yeseul Cho,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了低秩适应(LoRA)设置下谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的动力学行为，通过分析其连续时间版本谱梯度流(SpecGF)，证明了"等速率"动力学现象——所有奇异值以相等速率增长，小奇异值比大奇异值更早达到目标值，与标准梯度流的"大奇异值优先"学习模式形成鲜明对比，并在因子范数有界条件下证明了从几乎所有初始化出发的全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管谱梯度下降(如Muon优化器)在大语言模型训练中表现优异，其内在动力学机制尚不清晰。在LoRA微调中，研究者观察到LoRA乘积的奇异值呈现近乎均匀增长的光谱现象，这促使他们从理论上探究SpecGD在低秩矩阵分解设置下的行为规律。

Method: 研究者采用连续时间分析方法，在简化的LoRA风格矩阵分解框架下，系统分析了谱梯度流(SpecGF)的动力学特性。

Result: 主要理论发现包括：(1) "等速率"动力学——所有奇异值以相等速率增长(仅含微小偏差)；(2) 小奇异值比大奇异值更早收敛到目标值，颠覆了标准梯度流的大奇异值优先学习模式；(3) 在因子范数有界的前提下，SpecGF可从几乎所有初始化收敛到全局极小值；(4) 加入ℓ₂正则化后可获得无条件全局收敛性。

Conclusion: 本研究首次从理论上揭示了谱梯度下降在LoRA低秩参数化下的独特光谱学习机制，解释了Muon等优化器的成功实践，并为理解深度学习优化器的设计提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

TL;DR: 提出一种模型无关的后处理框架，通过模式修补和k近邻过滤改进合成表格数据的保真度-隐私-效用权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成表格数据的实际部署需要在分布保真度、下游效用和隐私保护之间取得平衡，现有生成器需要实用的后处理方法来优化这一权衡

Method: 两阶段后处理框架：1）模式修补步骤修复缺失或严重欠代表性的类别，同时保持学习到的依赖关系；2）k近邻过滤器替换距离真实数据点过近的合成记录，强制实施最小距离分离。在三种公共数据集上，将该框架应用于前馈生成器和变分自编码器两种神经生成模型

Result: 在0.2-0.35的中等阈值下，该后处理使真实与合成分类分布间的散度降低最多36%，成对依赖保持的综合指标提升10-14%，同时将下游预测性能保持在未处理基线的约1%以内，基于距离的隐私指标得到改善，属性推断攻击的成功率基本保持不变

Conclusion: 该框架为选择阈值和应用事后修复以提高合成表格数据质量和经验隐私性提供了实用指导，可补充提供正式差分隐私保证的方法

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open source software projects depend on complex contributor networks for innovation and sustainability, but the structural dynamics and role differentiation within these networks are not well understood. This research aims to empirically characterize OSS contributor ecosystems to inform strategic retention policies and community health metrics.

Method: Applied advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis to 25 years of data from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem, including sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Used GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models to analyze thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories. Conducted statistical analysis including multiple regression models to correlate action types (commits, pull requests, issues) with influence metrics, and performed structural integrity simulations through node removal experiments.

Result: Found strong power-law distributions in influence where the top 1% of contributors control a substantial portion of network influence. Identified five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique structural positions. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations between specific action types and contributor influence. Temporal analysis revealed statistically significant trends in network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity with distinct regime changes at major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations demonstrated that Bridge contributors, despite being a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed.

Conclusion: The findings provide empirical evidence for developing strategic contributor retention policies, particularly focusing on critical Bridge contributors. The analysis offers actionable insights for monitoring community health metrics and understanding how contributor roles and network structure evolve over time, which can help maintain the sustainability and innovation capacity of OSS projects.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fully analytic framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling that augments ODE systems with sensitivity equations to compute exact parameter gradients, overcoming computational and stability limitations of numerical differentiation and automatic differentiation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conceptual hydrologic model calibration is slow and numerically fragile because gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks that are computationally demanding, introduce truncation errors and solver instabilities, and create substantial overhead for ODE systems.

Method: The authors develop an analytic sensitivity-based approach by augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations to jointly evolve model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters, enabling exact gradient computation for any differentiable loss function.

Result: The framework produces deterministic, physically interpretable gradients that eliminate step-size dependence and noise from numerical differentiation, avoid adjoint method instabilities and machine learning autodiff overhead, while supporting diverse loss functions including residuals, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling-Gupta efficiency, robust loss functions, and hydrograph-based functionals.

Conclusion: This work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking differentiable modeling's full potential without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based scientific agents suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors and static hypothesis spaces, which restricts novel discovery and wastes computation when baseline theories fail.

Method: PiEvo shifts focus from hypothesis search to principle evolution, integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism for autonomous theoretical worldview refinement.

Result: Achieves 90.81%~93.15% solution quality (29.7%~31.1% improvement over SOTA), 83.3% convergence speedup via reduced sample complexity, and maintains robust performance across diverse domains and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: PiEvo effectively addresses LLM agent inefficiency by evolving scientific principles rather than merely searching hypotheses, demonstrating significant improvements in discovery quality, speed, and robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

### [91] [The Window Dilemma: Why Concept Drift Detection is Ill-Posed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06456)
*Brandon Gower-Winter,Misja Groen,Georg Krempl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the conventional wisdom of concept drift detection by demonstrating that the "window dilemma" makes drift detection ill-posed and shows traditional batch learning methods often outperform specialized drift-aware techniques in data stream classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental assumption that concept drift detection is a well-posed problem by identifying that perceived drift is artificially induced by windowing mechanisms rather than genuine underlying data distribution changes, and that verification of drift events is practically impossible, making the entire detection paradigm questionable.

Method: The authors introduce the theoretical "Window Dilemma" concept, illustrate it with a concrete example, and conduct empirical comparisons between established drift detectors and various alternative adaptation strategies including traditional batch learning techniques on data streams.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that traditional batch learning methods frequently achieve superior performance compared to specialized drift-aware detectors, revealing that perceived drift is largely a windowing artifact and that drift detection constitutes an ill-posed problem.

Conclusion: The findings fundamentally question the purpose and utility of drift detectors in stream classification, suggesting the field may need to reconsider its focus and potentially favor simpler batch learning approaches over complex drift detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

### [92] [Achieving Better Local Regret Bound for Online Non-Convex Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06457)
*Tingkai Jia,Haiguang Wang,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes optimal regret bounds for online bilevel optimization (OBO) by proposing novel algorithms for both standard and window-averaged bilevel local regret settings, achieving Ω(1+V_T) and Ω(T/W²) optimal regret respectively with efficient gradient evaluations and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear, creating a theoretical gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: For standard bilevel local regret, the authors propose an algorithm achieving optimal regret Ω(1+V_T) with O(T log T) total inner-level gradient evaluations, plus a fully single-loop variant with gradient-variation terms. For window-averaged bilevel local regret, they design a window-based analysis algorithm capturing sublinear environmental variation and achieving optimal regret Ω(T/W²).

Result: The paper establishes the first optimal regret bounds for both OBO settings, demonstrates the algorithms achieve these theoretical bounds with efficient computational complexity (O(T log T) gradient evaluations), and provides experimental validation showing practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms provide theoretically optimal regret bounds for online bilevel optimization while maintaining computational efficiency, and empirical results confirm their practical effectiveness for machine learning applications.

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，通过因果反事实奖励机制训练大语言模型，使其学习过程有效且反事实鲁棒的可泛化推理模式，解决现有奖励机制仅关注最终答案正确性而忽视推理过程的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM奖励机制过度耦合最终答案正确性，导致推理过程合理但答案错误的情况获得低奖励，而逻辑错误但幸运猜对的轨迹获得高奖励，损害了推理泛化能力。现有方法未能从因果角度建模推理过程作为反事实实验的本质，缺乏对推理鲁棒性和有效性的显式优化。

Method: 1) 将多候选推理解释为因果反事实实验框架；2) 设计片段级反事实奖励，联合优化鲁棒性（推理步骤在扰动下保持答案分布稳定）和有效性（保证足够变异性以实现跨问题迁移）；3) 基于此奖励构建token级优势函数；4) 优化策略使模型偏好过程有效且反事实鲁棒的推理模式。

Result: 在多种基准测试上的广泛实验表明该方法具有优势，但未提供具体性能提升数据。核心贡献是方法论创新而非量化结果展示。

Conclusion: GCPO通过显式建模推理的因果反事实特性，有效解决了传统奖励机制对推理过程建模不足的问题，使LLM能学习更泛化、鲁棒且过程有效的推理策略，为可解释且可靠的LLM推理训练提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

### [94] [Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search for Robust Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06493)
*Zeen Song,Zihao Ma,Wenwen Qiang,Changwen Zheng,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies that Process Reward Models (PRMs) exhibit high epistemic uncertainty on out-of-distribution reasoning paths in LLM inference-time search, proves theoretically that uncertainty-aware strategies achieve sublinear regret versus linear regret for standard search, and proposes Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS) using Monte Carlo Dropout and reinforcement learning to dynamically allocate compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While inference-time reasoning scaling with PRM-guided search advances LLM problem-solving capabilities, PRMs suffer from fundamental epistemic uncertainty when evaluating reasoning paths outside their training distribution, producing unreliable scores that degrade search performance.

Method: Proposed Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS) that employs Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification and a reinforcement learning-based controller to dynamically allocate computational budget across reasoning paths based on uncertainty estimates.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves UATS achieves sublinear regret accumulation while standard search incurs linear regret; empirical experiments demonstrate UATS effectively mitigates out-of-distribution errors in PRM evaluations.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware search strategies provide a robust framework for inference-time reasoning by addressing PRMs' distributional limitations, with UATS offering a practical implementation that improves reliability through principled uncertainty quantification and adaptive computation allocation.

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统（MAS）设计存在人工成本高、鲁棒性差、泛化难的问题；自动方法中代码生成易失效，模板化方法限制灵活性。

Method: 将MAS生成建模为结构化配置生成问题，在配置空间中执行进化算法：从初始池选择配置，基于执行轨迹反馈进行变异和交叉操作，迭代优化候选池与经验记忆库。

Result: 在BBEH推理任务超EvoAgent 10.5分，WorkBench超7.1分；使用Claude-4.5-Sonnet时在SWE-Bench-Verified达79.1%准确率（持平榜单第一），且系统可执行性与运行时鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: EvoMAS通过进化配置生成实现了高效鲁棒的MAS自动设计，验证了配置空间优化比代码生成更可靠，为复杂任务智能体系统构建提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

Motivation: 深度知识追踪模型存在训练时间长、在短序列数据集上容易过拟合的问题，需要新的解决方案来提升效率。

Method: 采用表格基础模型（TFM）实现实时在线知识追踪，核心创新是双向注意力机制——在推理时同时跨时间步和训练集中其他学生的交互进行注意力计算，将测试序列与相关训练序列对齐，从而完全跳过训练步骤。

Result: 在多个规模递增的数据集上验证显示，该方法在持续观察更多学生交互的场景下，能够达到与现有方法相当的预测性能，同时实现高达273倍的加速。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于TFM的在线知识追踪范式有效解决了传统方法的训练效率问题，为知识追踪任务提供了无需训练、实时响应的新方向。

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

TL;DR: AdverISF: A self-supervised adversarial framework for separating task-relevant features from noise in data-scarce material science domains without explicit supervision labels


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material science datasets suffer from limited samples where meaningful features are heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts; standard regularization fails to isolate features while existing adversarial methods require unavailable explicit separation labels

Method: Proposes Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF) with: (1) Self-supervised adversarial mechanism enforcing statistical independence between task features and noise representations (2) Multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise across feature hierarchies to recover inadvertently discarded features

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios and achieves superior generalization on real-world material design tasks

Conclusion: Successfully enables precise feature-noise separation without supervision by combining adversarial independence enforcement with hierarchical noise recycling, advancing generalization in noise-confounded limited-data domains

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

TL;DR: MERGE enables component-wise model merging with reusable modular experts and input-aware recombination, overcoming reusability limitations and monolithic merging via bi-objective optimization and evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instance-specific model merging methods lack reusable configurations for batch inference and ignore component-level mergeability differences (e.g., attention vs. MLP layers), limiting efficiency and performance.

Method: Formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization (cross-task performance vs. storage efficiency), uses surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms to find Pareto-optimal configurations, builds a reusable modular expert library, and employs a lightweight router for dynamic input-specific model assembly.

Result: Consistently outperforms baselines across diverse model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies while enabling storage-efficient inference through modular expert recombination.

Conclusion: MERGE advances model merging by achieving reusable, fine-grained component integration and adaptive inference, demonstrating strong generalization and practical efficiency for heterogeneous tasks.

Abstract: Model merging constructs versatile models by integrating task-specific models without requiring labeled data or expensive joint retraining. Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components. To address these limitations, we propose MERGE (\underline{M}odular \underline{E}xpert \underline{R}ecombination for fine-\underline{G}rained m\underline{E}rging), a method that enables component-wise model merging and input-aware, on-demand module recombination at inference. MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints. Extensive experiments across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies demonstrate that MERGE consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes effectively.

TL;DR: Transformer neural network enables superior quantification of CEST MRI data compared to traditional methods


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CEST MRI offers advantages over conventional MRS but faces challenges in quantification due to complex signal dependencies on multiple physiological variables

Method: Developed a self-supervised transformer neural network to fit Bloch-McConnell equation-based physical model parameters to in-vitro CEST spectra

Result: The transformer network significantly outperformed classical gradient-based solvers in parameter quantification

Conclusion: Transformer architecture provides an effective solution for accurate CEST data quantification

Abstract: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality for detecting metabolites. It offers higher resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, quantification of CEST data is challenging because the measured signal results from a complex interplay of many physiological variables. Here, we introduce a transformer-based neural network to fit parameters such as metabolite concentrations, exchange and relaxation rates of a physical model derived from Bloch-McConnell equations to in-vitro CEST spectra. We show that our self-supervised trained neural network clearly outperforms the solution of classical gradient-based solver.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

Motivation: 在截断反馈的在线资源分配中，智能体面临双重挑战：学习未知的伯努利激活概率和阈值分布参数，同时在探索-利用间权衡以最大化累积奖励。传统方法难以处理参数不确定性与预算约束的耦合。

Conclusion: 工作揭示了该问题的内在难度，提出的算法在理论上接近最优，并在真实数据集上验证了有效性，为复杂约束下的在线学习提供了新方案。

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击多随意选用ℓ1、ℓ2或ℓ∞范数，缺乏对p参数如何系统影响对抗扰动结构特性的深入研究，需要建立范数选择的理论依据。

Method: 在p∈[1,2]范围内，采用两种标准稀疏性度量，提出基于平滑操作和一阶泰勒近似的通用平滑性度量框架，并在多数据集及CNN/Transformer架构上进行系统评估。

Result: ℓ1和ℓ2范数在多数场景下非最优，最优p值因任务而异；p∈[1.3,1.5]能取得稀疏性与平滑性的最佳权衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了对抗攻击中范数选择的重要性，为设计更有效的对抗攻击提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: Large language models can endogenously resist activation steering (ESR), with Llama-3.3-70B showing strong effects. Researchers identified 26 SAE latents causally linked to this resistance, which zero-ablation reduces by 25%. ESR can be enhanced 4x via prompting and induced in smaller models through fine-tuning, having dual implications for AI safety and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference (termed Endogenous Steering Resistance), and to explore the implications for AI safety, transparency, and controllability—particularly regarding whether such resistance protects against adversarial manipulation or interferes with beneficial safety interventions.

Method: Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations; identifying differentially activated latents during off-topic content; conducting zero-ablation experiments on causal latents; testing meta-prompting for self-monitoring; and fine-tuning smaller models on self-correction examples.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B exhibits substantial ESR while smaller Llama-3/Gemma-2 models show it less frequently; 26 SAE latents are causally linked to ESR; zero-ablating these latents reduces multi-attempt rate by 25%; meta-prompts increase multi-attempt rate by 4x; fine-tuning successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models.

Conclusion: ESR represents dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits with dual implications—potentially protecting against adversarial manipulation but possibly interfering with beneficial safety interventions. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

### [104] [The challenge of generating and evolving real-life like synthetic test data without accessing real-world raw data -- a Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06609)
*Maj-Annika Tammisto,Faiz Ali Shah,Daniel Rodriguez,Dietmar Pfahl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This systematic review examines synthetic test data generation methods for privacy-sensitive e-Government applications, finding that while 37 approaches exist, none fully meet requirements for creating and evolving synthetic test data without real data access, highlighting a research gap in data evolution capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level system testing of e-Government applications (cross-border information exchange, medicine, banking) requires realistic test data that preserves privacy. Current approaches typically need direct access to real-life data, and synthetic test data evolution remains underexplored despite new privacy regulations.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review following Kitchenham methodology and validity threat analysis guidelines, searching IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS, screening 1,013 publications and extracting data from 75 to identify relevant approaches.

Result: Identified 37 approaches that partially address the research question, with a common prerequisite of real data access. Nine synthetic generation approaches came closest, but none supported synthetic test data evolution, indicating a significant gap in existing methods.

Conclusion: No existing publication fully satisfies the requirement for evolving synthetic test data without raw data access. Synthetic test data evolution is an under-researched field requiring urgent attention in Digital Government Solutions, especially given new legal regulations.

Abstract: Background: High-level system testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life-like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain.
  Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data.
  Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity.
  Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation. Nine existing synthetic test data generation approaches were identified that were closest to answering our research question. Nevertheless, further work would be needed to add the ability to evolve synthetic test data to the existing approaches.
  Conclusions: None of the publications really covered our requirements completely, only partially. Synthetic test data evolution is a field that has not received much attention from researchers but needs to be explored in Digital Government Solutions, especially since new legal regulations are being placed in force in many countries.

### [105] [Temperature Scaling Attack Disrupting Model Confidence in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06638)
*Kichang Lee,Jaeho Jin,JaeYeon Park,Songkuk Kim,JeongGil Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-time federated learning attack called Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA) that corrupts model confidence calibration while preserving accuracy, evading detection and causing severe risk in mission-critical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive confidence is crucial for risk-aware decisions in mission-critical systems. Traditional federated learning attacks focus on accuracy or backdoors, leaving confidence calibration as an unexplored attack surface that could have serious real-world consequences.

Method: The Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA) injects temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training. This makes malicious updates appear benign by maintaining similar optimization behavior, thus evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection mechanisms.

Result: TSA achieves substantial calibration degradation (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy impact (<2% change). It converges under non-IID settings, evades detection, remains effective against robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses, and causes up to 7.2x increases in critical failures in healthcare and autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Confidence calibration represents a critical and overlooked attack surface in federated learning that requires new security considerations beyond traditional accuracy-focused defenses.

Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在持续学习中促进特征空间各向同性是否能提升表示质量，但实验表明各向同性正则化反而会损害模型准确率，暗示其在非平稳学习场景中不适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练中各向同性特征分布自然形成并有益，而持续学习因处理非平稳数据流产生各向异性特征，面临可塑性-稳定性困境。作者提出问题：强制各向同性是否有助于平衡这一困境并缓解灾难性遗忘？

Method: 通过在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上采用对比持续学习方法，实验验证了各向同性正则化对持续学习性能的影响。

Result: 实验发现各向同性正则化无法提升持续学习准确率，反而会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了集中式与持续学习在特征几何上的本质差异，表明各向同性虽在集中式训练中有效，但不适合作为非平稳学习场景的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

*Haoran Zhang,Haixuan Liu,Yong Liu,Yunzhong Qiu,Yuxuan Wang,Jianmin Wang,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiTS, a diffusion transformer that treats time series variates as distinct modalities using a dual-stream architecture with separate Time and Variate Attention modules, achieving SOTA performance by better capturing cross-variate dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative time series models, particularly Diffusion Transformers (DiT), fail to adequately utilize multi-dimensional properties and cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting due to simplistic conditioning and single-stream architectures.

Method: Proposes DiTS (Diffusion Transformers for Time Series) that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities, using a dual-stream Transformer block with Time Attention for temporal autoregressive modeling and Variate Attention for cross-variate modeling, while leveraging low-rank multivariate dependencies to reduce computation.

Result: DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths compared to traditional deterministic deep forecasting models, regardless of future exogenous variate observability.

Conclusion: DiTS provides a general-purpose architecture that effectively captures both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, establishing generative models as superior to deterministic approaches for multi-dimensional time series forecasting.

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

TL;DR: 当前医疗离线强化学习研究通常将患者数据聚合为固定时间间隔，但本文发现这种时间重采样会显著降低算法在真实部署中的性能，并揭示了其三大失效机制，强调需要专门处理临床决策不规则时序性的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗离线强化学习(ORL)研究将不规则临床数据简化为固定时间间隔，但这种时间处理方式对模型安全性和有效性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过网格世界导航任务和UVA/Padova临床糖尿病模拟器，系统分析了时间重采样对离线强化学习算法部署性能的影响。

Result: 1) 时间重采样导致性能显著下降；2) 揭示三大失效机制：反事实轨迹生成、时序期望扭曲和泛化误差累积；3) 标准离线评估指标无法检测这些性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前医疗ORL流程存在根本性风险，亟需开发能明确处理临床决策不规则时序性的新方法，以确保模型在实际医疗环境中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在蛋白质骨架设计中计算开销大，现有流匹配方法如Proteina效率仍不足；tokenization在结构压缩加速领域潜力未充分探索

Method: 提出SaDiT框架：1) 结合SaProt Tokenization与DiT构建离散潜空间，保持SE(3)等变性；2) 设计IPA Token Cache机制，通过重用采样过程中的token状态优化Invariant Point Attention计算

Result: 在无条件生成和fold-class条件生成任务上均优于RFDiffusion和Proteina，计算速度更快且结构可行性更高，能捕获复杂拓扑特征并具备良好可设计性

Conclusion: SaDiT通过几何离散化和计算缓存显著提升蛋白质骨架生成效率，为大规模结构探索提供新范式

Abstract: Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.

TL;DR: Adaptive-CaRe: a model-agnostic regularization method that balances predictive accuracy with causal robustness in medical outcome prediction by penalizing differences between statistical and causal feature contributions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML models optimize for accuracy but can exploit spurious correlations, while causal structure learning methods are overly conservative, creating a fundamental trade-off between predictive performance and robustness that impedes clinical decision-making

Method: Proposes Adaptive-CaRe regularizer that incorporates a penalty proportional to the divergence between estimated statistical contribution and causal contribution of input features, allowing tunable balance via regularization strength λ

Result: Synthetic experiments demonstrate robust predictor identification with competitive accuracy; causal benchmark validates λ-based trade-off navigation; real-world dataset confirms practical translation to clinical settings

Conclusion: Adaptive-CaRe effectively resolves the accuracy-robustness trade-off in medical prediction, providing a simple and generalizable framework; future work will explore alternative causal learning frameworks and complex models at scale

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

TL;DR: 该论文针对RLVR中群组采样存在的采样偏差问题，提出一种Focal loss启发的难度感知优势缩放系数，通过动态降低高成功率提示的更新权重，在不增加计算成本的前提下显著提升罕见正确模式的发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR依赖群组采样估计优势函数，但大群组受限于计算成本，小群组则会产生系统性偏差：偏向已有高概率轨迹、遗漏罕见正确解、混合奖励信号导致概率质量过度集中于常见解，形成算法性能瓶颈。

Method: 通过理论推导建立群组大小与遗漏罕见正确模式概率之间的非单调关系模型，揭示更新过程中正确集合内部的质量重分配机制，进而设计基于提示难度的优势缩放系数，直接集成到GRPO/DAPO/CISPO等群组相对RLVR算法中。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验显示，该方法在保持pass@1不降的前提下，将GRPO的pass@256从64.1提升至70.3，DAPO从69.3提升至72.5，CISPO从73.2提升至76.8，且无需增大群组规模或增加计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级的奖励空间重新加权策略，有效缓解了小群组采样固有的探索不足缺陷，证明智能的难度感知机制比单纯扩大采样规模更能高效提升RLVR算法对稀有正确解的覆盖率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

*Rishabh Jain,Keisuke Okumura,Michael Amir,Pietro Lio,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HMAGAT introduces a hypergraph-based attention mechanism for MAPF that captures group dynamics beyond pairwise interactions, achieving new SoTA with significantly fewer parameters and less training data by mitigating attention dilution inherent in GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract identifies that existing learning-based MAPF approaches using GNNs are limited to pairwise message passing, causing attention dilution and suboptimal performance in dense environments where higher-order group coordination is critical. This representational bottleneck motivates the need for explicit modeling of group dynamics.

Method: The paper proposes HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), which uses attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group interactions, moving beyond the pairwise constraints of traditional GNNs.

Result: HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers despite having only 1M parameters and being trained on 100× less data than the previous SoTA 85M parameter model. Empirical analysis shows hypergraph representations mitigate attention dilution and capture complex interactions that pairwise methods fail to model.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that appropriate inductive biases (like hypergraph structures for group coordination) are often more critical than training data size or parameter count for multi-agent problems, offering a more efficient and effective approach to solving MAPF.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a representative multi-agent coordination problem, where multiple agents are required to navigate to their respective goals without collisions. Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的概念擦除存在鲁棒性与保留性的矛盾：鲁棒性要求模型抵抗语义相关提示对已擦除概念的重新激活，保留性要求维持无关概念以保持模型整体效用。现有方法通常强化一方而牺牲另一方，无法满足实际应用需求。

Method: 提出Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS)，一种基于梯度引导的对抗训练框架，在不依赖保留数据的情况下协同优化鲁棒性与保留性目标。

Result: 摘要未呈现具体实验数据，但声称该方法相较现有方案能同时提升鲁棒性与保留性，克服传统单目标优化的局限性。

Conclusion: AEGIS通过创新的梯度协同对抗机制，有效解决了概念擦除的鲁棒性-保留性权衡问题，为扩散模型的安全对齐提供了无需额外保留数据的新范式。

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归生成式PDE求解器在粗到细多尺度场景下因每步重新生成未解析细尺度而产生累积漂移，这反映了无记忆闭包的结构性局限。扩散/流匹配生成器虽具马尔可夫内部动态，但其滚动稳定性受每步条件律误差控制，亟需引入记忆机制以解耦误差来源并提升长期预测稳定性。

Method: 1) 运用Mori-Zwanzig投影形式主义，从数学上揭示消除未解析变量后精确演化方程包含马尔可夫项、记忆项和正交强迫项，阐明无记忆闭包的根本缺陷；2) 提出记忆条件扩散/流匹配框架，通过潜在特征注入紧凑在线状态；3) 利用概率解体理论构建结构化条件尾先验，降低填充缺失频率的传输需求；4) 证明条件核的Wasserstein稳定性；5) 推导分离记忆近似误差与条件生成误差的离散Grönwall滚动误差界。

Result: 理论层面：获得条件核的Wasserstein稳定性严格证明，并建立可分离记忆近似误差与生成条件误差的离散Grönwall滚动界。实验层面：在含激波可压缩流与多尺度混合基准测试中，方法显著提升长期滚动预测准确性与稳定性，细尺度谱特性与统计保真度明显改善。

Conclusion: 记忆机制是克服生成式PDE求解器长期漂移的关键。所提方法通过结构化在线状态编码物理记忆，不仅在理论上提供了稳定性保证与误差可解释性分解，更在实践上验证了其在多尺度流体动力学问题中的有效性，为粗到细生成建模建立了新的理论框架与技术范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Motivation: 现有权重量化方法无法高效压缩至二进制(1-bit)或亚1-bit级别，或需大量数据计算资源，或带来额外存储开销，阻碍了大模型在消费硬件上的部署。

Method: 将量化建模为低秩二进制分解问题，采用ADMM算法精确初始化二值矩阵与缩放因子，再通过块重建和模型重建过程微调参数，属于纯训练后量化(PTQ)框架。

Result: 建立低内存PTQ新帕累托前沿，亚1-bit压缩下达到SOTA精度。13小时内在单H100上将Llama2-70B压缩25.8倍，使其可在8GB消费级GPU运行。

Conclusion: NanoQuant首次实现LLM二进制与亚1-bit高效压缩，显著降低部署门槛，为超大规模模型在消费硬件的普及提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

*Sohan Venkatesh,Ashish Mahendran Kurapath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation steering methods for controlling LLMs suffer from fundamental non-identifiability: multiple distinct interventions produce identical behavioral outcomes, challenging their interpretability and reliability for safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the implicit assumption that steering vectors uniquely reveal meaningful internal representations, questioning the identifiability of these interventions from input-output behavior alone.

Method: Formalizes steering as an intervention on internal representations and proves non-identifiability under realistic conditions due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions; empirically validates this across multiple models and semantic traits.

Result: Shows orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes; identifies that identifiability requires structural assumptions like statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation, or cross-layer consistency.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental interpretability limits of activation steering and clarifies the structural assumptions necessary for reliable, safety-critical control of language models.

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文通过引入三种极简归纳偏置（空间平滑性、稳定性和时间局部性），证明通用Transformer架构能够学习物理世界模型，从曲线拟合过渡到发现牛顿力学定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合AI预测能力与真实物理理解之间的鸿沟，探索通用架构如何发现支配物理定律而非仅记忆模式，解决此前AI物理学家依赖强领域先验而通用Transformer完全失败的困境。

Method: 系统性地向Transformer架构引入三种归纳偏置：1) 空间平滑性（将预测建模为连续回归）；2) 稳定性（通过噪声上下文训练缓解误差累积）；3) 时间局部性（限制注意力窗口仅关注近期状态，强制模型假设未来仅依赖局部历史）。

Result: 仅施加前两种偏置时，Transformer成功学习开普勒世界模型，能拟合行星轨迹椭圆；增加第三种时间局部性偏置后，模型被迫放弃曲线拟合，转而发现牛顿力表示形式，实现了从描述性到解释性的质变。

Conclusion: 简单的架构选择从根本上决定AI系统是成为曲线拟合器还是物理学家，为自动化科学发现迈出关键一步，表明通用AI架构具备发现物理规律的潜力。

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.

### [120] [Soft Forward-Backward Representations for Zero-shot Reinforcement Learning with General Utilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06769)
*Marco Bagatella,Thomas Rupf,Georg Martius,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends zero-shot reinforcement learning from standard additive rewards to general utilities by proposing a maximum entropy forward-backward algorithm that optimizes arbitrary differentiable objectives directly from offline data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard zero-shot RL methods (like forward-backward algorithms) only handle additive rewards linear in occupancy measures. However, many RL problems involve more complex utilities (e.g., distribution matching, pure exploration) that aren't reducible to additive rewards, necessitating an extension to this more expressive setting.

Method: The authors propose a maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm that recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. They combine this with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings to optimize general utilities directly at test-time, avoiding iterative optimization schemes.

Result: The method successfully handles RL problems with general utilities while retaining the favorable zero-shot properties of traditional FB algorithms, as demonstrated on both didactic and high-dimensional experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed soft forward-backward algorithm effectively extends zero-shot RL to more general and expressive problem classes, maintaining the benefits of offline data utilization and test-time optimization without iterative schemes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

TL;DR: Evaluating three LLM prompting strategies for generating realistic, high-quality synthetic essays to augment automated scoring engine training data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited training data constrains machine-learning automated scoring engines (ASE) for constructed responses; data augmentation using LLMs may mitigate this but requires preserving original writing quality and realism

Method: Compared three LLM prompting approaches (predict next, sentence, 25 examples) by generating simulated student essays, then human raters scored them and rated text realism

Result: "Predict next" strategy achieved highest rater agreement on simulated scores and best preserved original essay quality; "predict next" and "25 examples" produced most realistic text

Conclusion: "Predict next" prompting is most effective overall for ASE data augmentation, though strategy choice depends on prioritization of score agreement, quality preservation, or realism

Abstract: Data augmentation can mitigate limited training data in machine-learning automated scoring engines for constructed response items. This study seeks to determine how well three approaches to large language model prompting produce essays that preserve the writing quality of the original essays and produce realistic text for augmenting ASE training datasets. We created simulated versions of student essays, and human raters assigned scores to them and rated the realism of the generated text. The results of the study indicate that the predict next prompting strategy produces the highest level of agreement between human raters regarding simulated essay scores, predict next and sentence strategies best preserve the rated quality of the original essay in the simulated essays, and predict next and 25 examples strategies produce the most realistic text as judged by human raters.

Conclusion: 本文填补了多校准梯度提升收敛性理论的空白，提供了在不同条件下的收敛保证，明确了其在实际应用中的收敛优势与多校准性能，为方法的大规模部署提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

### [124] [Displacement-Resistant Extensions of DPO with Nonconvex $f$-Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06788)
*Idan Pipano,Shoham Sabach,Kavosh Asadi,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by replacing KL divergence with f-divergence penalties in RLHF. It identifies two key conditions: a "DPO-inducing" condition that is more general than convexity and ensures tractability, and a "displacement-resistant" condition that prevents probability collapse. The novel SquaredPO loss, which satisfies both conditions, offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively with DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While DPO and related algorithms optimize RLHF objectives using KL divergence penalties, prior work showed generalization to f-divergence is possible. However, the essential mathematical conditions for this generalization to remain tractable and avoid empirical failures like probability displacement were not characterized, limiting theoretical understanding and algorithmic design.

Method: The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of the RLHF objective with f-divergence constraints. They first identify a generalized "DPO-inducing" condition that precisely characterizes when the optimization remains tractable, relaxing the convexity requirement. Second, they derive a necessary "displacement-resistant" condition to prevent probability displacement. They instantiate both conditions to formulate the SquaredPO loss function.

Result: The analysis proves convexity of the generating function f is not essential for tractability. The DPO-inducing condition provides a precise characterization of feasible f-divergences. The displacement-resistant condition prevents probability collapse where winner/loser probabilities approach zero. SquaredPO satisfies both conditions and is shown to have stronger theoretical guarantees while maintaining competitive empirical performance compared to DPO.

Conclusion: This work establishes a more general theoretical framework for preference optimization algorithms, revealing the minimal conditions needed for effective RLHF via f-divergence penalties. SquaredPO emerges as a theoretically-principled alternative to DPO, demonstrating that stronger mathematical guarantees can be achieved without sacrificing practical performance, potentially guiding future algorithm design in LLM alignment.

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

Motivation: 作为概率模型，大语言模型在推理过程中会产生远离典型行为但意义重大的罕见事件。由于这些事件本身难以观测，且LLM的庞大规模意味着开发阶段完全未观察到的行为在部署时可能变得突出，亟需系统性分析框架来应对这一挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和管理LLM中的罕见事件提供了全面的方法论，其概念和技术具有广泛的适用性，有助于提高大模型部署的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

*Hangting Ye,He Zhao. Wei Fan,Xiaozhuang Song,Dandan Guo,Yi Chang,Hongyuan Zha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTAD is a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any tabular anomaly detector by calibrating sample-specific scores using Optimal Transport distance between dual distributions of normal data (empirical and K-means structural), theoretically guaranteeing higher calibration scores for anomalies and empirically improving 7 detectors across 34 datasets without additional tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular anomaly detection suffers from data heterogeneity and method-specific assumptions that limit generalizability; no single detector consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios, necessitating a universal calibration approach that works post-hoc on any detector's outputs.

Method: CTAD characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions—empirical distribution from random sampling and structural distribution from K-means centroids—then measures disruption to their compatibility using Optimal Transport distance when adding a test sample; normal samples cause minimal disruption while anomalies cause maximal disruption, enabling calibrated score amplification.

Result: Experiments on 34 diverse datasets with 7 representative detectors across all major categories (density, classification, reconstruction, isolation) show CTAD provides statistically significant performance improvements, enhances state-of-the-art deep methods, and demonstrates robust hyperparameter invariance without requiring additional tuning.

Conclusion: CTAD establishes a theoretically grounded, universally applicable calibration framework that systematically improves anomaly detection across heterogeneous tabular data, offering practical deployment advantages through its model-agnostic nature and zero-tuning requirements while explaining via OT lower bounds why anomalies receive higher expected scores.

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 通过优化损失景观的平坦度，SAM-based方法成功解决了混合建模中科学模型被忽略的问题，提供了更通用且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper bridges the theoretical gap in discrete diffusion models by analyzing reverse processes through thermodynamic entropy production, deriving Wasserstein distance bounds, and introducing two physics-inspired sampling schedules (EDS and WDS) that outperform state-of-the-art methods across multiple domains with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While discrete diffusion models are powerful for sequence data, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than continuous diffusion models, creating a need for rigorous theoretical foundations to improve sampling efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors analyze discrete diffusion reverse dynamics using thermodynamic entropy production as a proxy for information generation, derive a bound on Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and data distribution, and develop two novel sampling schedules: Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS) with constant information gain rate, and Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS) with equal Wasserstein distance steps.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates that both EDS and WDS significantly outperform state-of-the-art sampling strategies across synthetic data, music notation, vision, and language modeling tasks, consistently achieving superior performance while requiring lower computational budget.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired metrics (entropy production and Wasserstein distance) provide principled, effective frameworks for designing sampling schedules in discrete diffusion models, leading to both theoretical advances and substantial practical improvements in generative modeling efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Robust, Bounded, and Smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to address the limitations of traditional loss functions when handling high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets. The method is implemented in a neural network framework for time series forecasting (L_RoBoS-NN), with theoretical analysis and experimental validation showing superior performance over benchmarks, especially in the presence of outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional loss functions exhibit significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, resulting in reduced model performance and slower convergence during training.

Method: The authors developed a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function with theoretical analysis of its generalization ability and robustness. They implemented this loss within a neural network framework for time series forecasting, creating the L_RoBoS-NN algorithm.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world datasets, including those with artificially infused outliers, demonstrated that the L_RoBoS-NN algorithm outperforms benchmark models across various accuracy measures.

Conclusion: The proposed RoBoS-NN loss function effectively addresses the robustness issues of traditional loss functions, and the L_RoBoS-NN algorithm shows superior performance for time series forecasting, particularly in challenging outlier-contaminated scenarios.

Abstract: The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.

Conclusion: 该框架能提供细粒度、可靠且感知不确定性的短期需求预测，支持多模式出行规划和实时运营优化，对共享微出行服务具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

TL;DR: 本文提出DeVA（解耦方差适应）优化器，通过将AdaGrad更新分解为方差适应项和尺度不变项，在向量自适应优化与矩阵谱优化之间建立桥梁，在语言建模和图像分类任务中超越Muon和SOAP等SOTA方法，token消耗降低约6.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam等自适应方法因其坐标级适应的二阶特性成为大规模向量优化的标准，而Muon等矩阵谱优化器展现了将权重矩阵整体处理的优势。然而，二者难以结合：直接推广不可行，且无法简单地将Adam的适应机制迁移到矩阵谱空间。

Method: 通过重构AdaGrad更新，将其分解为方差适应项和尺度不变项，提出DeVA（解耦方差适应）框架，实现从Adam到自适应谱下降的无缝过渡。

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类的广泛实验中，DeVA持续优于Muon和SOAP等先进方法，token使用量减少约6.6%。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明，方差适应项有效提升了块平滑性，从而加速收敛。

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

TL;DR: Vision Transformer组件的高可塑性（低平滑度）能显著提升迁移学习微调性能，注意力模块和前馈层是关键适配目标，挑战了平滑性总是有利的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer架构的平滑性在泛化、训练稳定性和对抗鲁棒性方面已有广泛研究，但其在迁移学习中的作用尚未被充分理解。论文旨在分析视觉Transformer组件的适应能力（可塑性）及其对迁移学习的影响。

Method: 将可塑性定义为输出对输入变化的平均变化率，量化组件对输入扰动的敏感性（高可塑性等价于低平滑度）。通过理论分析和大量实验，评估不同ViT组件的可塑性特性。

Result: 注意力模块和前馈层具有较高的可塑性，优先在这些组件上进行微调能持续获得更好的迁移学习性能。实验为选择适配组件提供了原则性指导。

Conclusion: 研究表明高可塑性而非平滑性是迁移学习的关键，颠覆了"平滑性总是理想"的传统假设，为理解Transformer的功能特性提供了新视角。

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CardioGraphFENet is a graph-based neural network surrogate that rapidly simulates full-cycle left ventricular mechanics with high fidelity to traditional FEA, while reducing computational cost and supervision needs through cycle-consistent bidirectional learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid patient-specific left ventricular mechanics simulation for clinical decision support by overcoming the computational intensity of conventional FEA and limitations of existing graph-based and physics-informed neural network approaches.

Method: The paper proposes CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), which integrates: (1) a global-local graph encoder with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (2) a gated recurrent unit temporal encoder conditioned on volume-time signals, and (3) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for simultaneous loading and inverse unloading. The model is trained on a large FEA simulation dataset.

Result: The model achieves high fidelity to FEA ground truths, produces physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops matching FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model, and significantly reduces FEA supervision requirements with minimal accuracy loss through its cycle-consistency strategy.

Conclusion: CGFENet provides a unified, rapid, and accurate surrogate for full-cycle LV mechanics estimation, offering a practical solution for clinical planning while reducing computational burden and supervision needs compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Image-based patient-specific simulation of left ventricular (LV) mechanics is valuable for understanding cardiac function and supporting clinical intervention planning, but conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive. Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex cardiac geometries. We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset. The proposed model integrates (i) a global--local graph encoder to capture mesh features with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (ii) a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder conditioned on the target volume-time signal to model cycle-coherent dynamics, and (iii) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for both loading and inverse unloading within a single framework. These strategies enable high fidelity with respect to traditional FEA ground truths and produce physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops that match FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model. In particular, the cycle-consistency strategy enables a significant reduction in FEA supervision with only minimal loss in accuracy.

### [134] [Sample Complexity of Causal Identification with Temporal Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06899)
*Ameya Rathod,Sujay Belsare,Salvik Krishna Nautiyal,Dhruv Laad,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper combines time-series dynamics with multi-environment heterogeneity to solve the ill-posed causal graph recovery problem, showing temporal structure can compensate for insufficient environmental diversity and establishing that heavy-tailed noise preserves identifiability but drastically increases sample complexity compared to Gaussian assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal graph recovery from observational data is fundamentally ill-posed without strong assumptions. While prior work separately leveraged either temporal dynamics or environmental heterogeneity, this paper integrates both complementary sources to achieve unified identifiability conditions and understand statistical limits under realistic heavy-tailed noise distributions common in non-stationary systems.

Method: The authors integrate temporal structure (time-series) and multi-environment heterogeneity as joint constraints on causal graph recovery. They develop unified necessary identifiability conditions and perform comparative statistical analysis under thin-tailed (Gaussian) versus heavy-tailed (Student's t) noise distributions using geometric identifiability theory and information-theoretic bounds to quantify sample complexity.

Result: Key findings: (1) Temporal structure can substitute for insufficient environmental diversity, enabling identifiability where it would otherwise fail; (2) Geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant under heavy-tailed distributions; (3) Sample complexity diverges significantly from Gaussian baseline under heavy tails; (4) Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify the robustness cost; (5) Fundamental limits of covariance-based methods are established for non-stationary systems.

Conclusion: The work shifts the paradigm from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice. It demonstrates that combining temporal and environmental heterogeneity provides powerful constraints, but robustness to heavy-tailed noise imposes steep statistical costs, establishing practical limits for causal discovery methods in realistic settings.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

*Emmanuel Esposito,Andrew Jacobsen,Hao Qiu,Mengxiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对具有任意时变移动代价系数的无约束在线凸优化问题，提出首个算法实现了Õ(√((1+P_T)(T+∑_t λ_t)))的可比自适应动态遗憾界，并应用于延迟反馈和时变记忆场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCO框架中移动代价通常假设为常数或零，而实际决策系统的调整成本常随时间动态变化（如市场价格波动、物理系统惯性），亟需自适应处理时变移动代价的理论框架。

Method: 创新性地设计考虑一阶移动代价依赖的优化算法，通过动态调整决策序列，将时变移动代价结构编码到遗憾界分析中。

Result: 首次获得形如Õ(√((1+P_T)(T+∑_t λ_t)))的动态遗憾界，当所有λ_t=0时，该界自然退化为标准OCO的最优静态遗憾Õ(√T)和动态遗憾Õ(√(1+P_T)T)。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了时变移动代价的统一分析框架，揭示了移动代价一阶依赖的关键作用，并通过问题归约为延迟反馈和时变记忆提供了新的最优算法设计思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

Method: Comprehensive ablation study of a standard patch Transformer architecture, systematically varying model scaling, data composition, and training techniques under a controlled, straightforward protocol to isolate performance factors.

Result: The generic patch Transformer achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance; key performance drivers are identified; excellent architectural scalability is confirmed; and multi-dimensional model scaling results are provided.

Conclusion: The generic patch Transformer is highly effective for time series forecasting, and systematic ablation studies can attribute performance to specific factors. The released open-source model establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline for the field.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

TL;DR: LEIA is a two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional error subspace and restricting adaptation via low-rank logit adjustments, requiring no group labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models exhibit systematic failures on unknown/unlabeled subpopulations, but existing robust methods require prior knowledge of subgroups through annotations.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Identify low-dimensional subspace where model errors concentrate in representation space; (2) Apply low-rank adjustments to classifier logits within this error-informed subspace, without modifying backbone or needing group labels.

Result: On five real-world datasets across three knowledge settings (no/partial/full subgroup information), LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while being fast, parameter-efficient, and hyperparameter-robust.

Conclusion: LEIA effectively enhances group robustness without group annotations, making it suitable for real-world applications where sensitive subgroups are unknown or unlabeled.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对连续时间马尔可夫扩散过程的离策略强化学习问题，本文利用扩散过程的正则性，建立了贝尔曼算子在希尔伯特空间中的正定性和有界性理论，提出了Sobolev-prox fitted Q学习算法，并证明其估计误差由近似误差、局部复杂度、指数衰减优化误差和离散化误差控制，表明该问题在函数逼近下不比监督学习更难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续时间马尔可夫扩散过程在科学和工程中广泛存在，但现有强化学习方法要么依赖精确的模型假设，要么无法处理离散观测与连续动态的混合设置。特别是缺乏对贝尔曼算子理论性质的深入理解，导致算法设计和误差分析困难。本文旨在建立无模型离策略学习理论，突破传统结构假设的限制。

Method: 1) 利用扩散过程的正则性(ellipticity)揭示贝尔曼算子在再生核希尔伯特空间中的正定性和有界性新性质；2) 基于此提出Sobolev-prox fitted Q学习算法，通过迭代求解最小二乘回归问题直接学习值和优势函数；3) 采用Sobolev空间作为函数逼近空间，引入近端项保证稳定性。

Result: 推导出估计误差的Oracle不等式，其由四项组成：(i)函数类的最佳近似误差；(ii)局部Rademacher复杂度；(iii)随迭代指数衰减的优化误差；(iv)数值离散化误差。误差界与采样复杂度直接相关，证明了在正则性条件下，带函数逼近的马尔可夫扩散过程强化学习在统计难度上与监督学习相当。

Conclusion: 扩散过程的正则性是使连续时间强化学习免于"维数灾难"的关键结构性质。Sobolev-prox fitted Q学习算法实现了无模型离策略学习，其理论保证表明：在适当的函数空间中，连续时间问题的统计复杂度可降至与监督学习相同的水平，为设计高效算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

TL;DR: Aurora presents a unified training-serving system for speculative decoding that closes the online learning loop by continuously adapting speculators from live inference traces, achieving 1.5x day-0 speedup and effective adaptation to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decoupled speculator training-serving creates deployment lag (offline training delay), delayed utility feedback (speedup unknown until post-training), and domain-drift degradation (stale speculators on new domains).

Method: Aurora reframes online speculator learning as asynchronous RL: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, rejected proposals provide implicit negative feedback. It integrates SGLang inference with asynchronous training servers, enabling hot-swapped updates and day-0 deployment without service interruption.

Result: Achieves 1.5x speedup on day-0 deployment for frontier models (MiniMax M2.1 229B, Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B) and 1.25x additional speedup over static speculators when adapting to distribution shifts in user traffic (Qwen3, Llama3).

Conclusion: Unified online learning eliminates deployment lag and enables continuous adaptation, making speculative decoding more practical and efficient for production LLM serving.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Conclusion: Interpretable machine learning combined with data-driven optimization offers a promising approach for trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.

Conclusion: 多轮对比学习范式相比传统单轮方法在训练效率和模型性能上均表现出优势，为通用多模态嵌入模型提供了更优的训练框架。

Abstract: Universal Multimodal embedding models built on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have traditionally employed contrastive learning, which aligns representations of query-target pairs across different modalities. Yet, despite its empirical success, they are primarily built on a "single-turn" formulation where each query-target pair is treated as an independent data point. This paradigm leads to computational inefficiency when scaling, as it requires a separate forward pass for each pair and overlooks potential contextual relationships between multiple queries that can relate to the same context. In this work, we introduce Multi-Turn Contrastive Learning (MuCo), a dialogue-inspired framework that revisits this process. MuCo leverages the conversational nature of MLLMs to process multiple, related query-target pairs associated with a single image within a single forward pass. This allows us to extract a set of multiple query and target embeddings simultaneously, conditioned on a shared context representation, amplifying the effective batch size and overall training efficiency. Experiments exhibit MuCo with a newly curated 5M multimodal multi-turn dataset (M3T), which yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB and M-BEIR benchmarks, while markedly enhancing both training efficiency and representation coherence across modalities.

TL;DR: This paper proposes TokenMixer-Large, a scaled-up recommendation model that addresses limitations in previous TokenMixer architecture through improved residual design, gradient flow, and a novel Sparse-Per-token MoE. It achieves 7B parameters on online traffic and 15B on offline experiments with significant performance gains at ByteDance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works on scaling laws for recommendation models have limited experimental scale, and the foundational TokenMixer architecture suffers from sub-optimal residual design, insufficient gradient updates in deep models, incomplete MoE sparsification, and limited scalability exploration.

Method: Proposes TokenMixer-Large using four key techniques: mixing-and-reverting operation, inter-layer residuals, auxiliary loss, and a novel Sparse-Per-token MoE architecture to address core design limitations.

Result: Successfully scales parameters to 7 billion on online traffic and 15 billion on offline experiments; deployed in multiple ByteDance scenarios with significant offline and online performance improvements.

Conclusion: TokenMixer-Large effectively resolves previous architectural limitations and demonstrates successful large-scale deployment, validating its scalability and practical value for industrial recommendation systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the study of scaling laws for large recommendation models has gradually gained attention. Works such as Wukong, HiFormer, and DHEN have attempted to increase the complexity of interaction structures in ranking models and validate scaling laws between performance and parameters/FLOPs by stacking multiple layers. However, their experimental scale remains relatively limited. Our previous work introduced the TokenMixer architecture, an efficient variant of the standard Transformer where the self-attention mechanism is replaced by a simple reshape operation, and the feed-forward network is adapted to a pertoken FFN. The effectiveness of this architecture was demonstrated in the ranking stage by the model presented in the RankMixer paper. However, this foundational TokenMixer architecture itself has several design limitations. In this paper, we propose TokenMixer-Large, which systematically addresses these core issues: sub-optimal residual design, insufficient gradient updates in deep models, incomplete MoE sparsification, and limited exploration of scalability. By leveraging a mixing-and-reverting operation, inter-layer residuals, the auxiliary loss and a novel Sparse-Pertoken MoE architecture, TokenMixer-Large successfully scales its parameters to 7-billion and 15-billion on online traffic and offline experiments, respectively. Currently deployed in multiple scenarios at ByteDance, TokenMixer -Large has achieved significant offline and online performance gains.

TL;DR: The paper proposes R2LED, a novel lifelong user modeling framework using semantic IDs (SID) to address noisy retrieval and lack of semantic understanding in CTR prediction, introducing multi-route mixed retrieval and bi-level fusion refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lifelong user modeling methods for CTR prediction suffer from noisy retrieval due to skewed data distribution and lack of semantic understanding in refinement, while semantic enhancement approaches like LLMs face impractical inference costs or insufficient granularity.

Method: R2LED framework employs Semantic IDs (SID) with two key components: 1) Multi-route Mixed Retrieval using parallel recall routes from various granularities and mixed collaborative/semantic views; 2) Bi-level Fusion Refinement with target-aware cross-attention for route-level fusion and gate mechanism for SID-level fusion to bridge semantic and collaborative spaces.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate R2LED's superior performance and efficiency in lifelong user modeling for CTR prediction.

Conclusion: R2LED effectively addresses lifelong user modeling challenges by leveraging the multi-granularity and lightweight benefits of semantic identity, providing a practical and efficient solution for industrial CTR prediction systems.

Abstract: Lifelong user modeling, which leverages users' long-term behavior sequences for CTR prediction, has been widely applied in personalized services. Existing methods generally adopted a two-stage "retrieval-refinement" strategy to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, they still suffer from (i) noisy retrieval due to skewed data distribution and (ii) lack of semantic understanding in refinement. While semantic enhancement, e.g., LLMs modeling or semantic embeddings, offers potential solutions to these two challenges, these approaches face impractical inference costs or insufficient representation granularity. Obsorbing multi-granularity and lightness merits of semantic identity (SID), we propose a novel paradigm that equips retrieval and refinement in Lifelong User Modeling with SEmantic IDs (R2LED) to address these issues. First, we introduce a Multi-route Mixed Retrieval for the retrieval stage. On the one hand, it captures users' interests from various granularities by several parallel recall routes. On the other hand, a mixed retrieval mechanism is proposed to efficiently retrieve candidates from both collaborative and semantic views, reducing noise. Then, for refinement, we design a Bi-level Fusion Refinement, including a target-aware cross-attention for route-level fusion and a gate mechanism for SID-level fusion. It can bridge the gap between semantic and collaborative spaces, exerting the merits of SID. The comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in both performance and efficiency. To facilitate the reproduction, we have released the code online https://github.com/abananbao/R2LED.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态检索在美团外卖等场景日益重要，但主流双塔架构的联合优化存在两大问题：1）部分模态主导训练而其它模态被忽视；2）跨模态训练速度不一致导致单轮次问题。

Method: 提出分阶段预训练策略，每阶段专注特定任务以实现多模态特征均衡利用并避免单轮次问题；同时设计生成式和判别式任务，学习语义ID与查询、物品特征的关联。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过分阶段训练解决了多模态不平衡问题，显著提升检索性能和业务指标，在实际应用中展现出有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval models are becoming increasingly important in scenarios such as food delivery, where rich multimodal features can meet diverse user needs and enable precise retrieval. Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines. Online A/B testing on the Meituan platform shows that our approach achieves a 1.12% increase in revenue and a 1.02% increase in click-through rate, validating the effectiveness and superiority of our method in practical applications.

TL;DR: Cotten4Rec通过单CUDA核线性余弦相似度注意力替代Softmax，显著降低序列推荐计算开销且精度损失微小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对BERT4Rec等基于Softmax注意力的Transformer序列推荐模型计算开销大的问题，难以满足大规模实际部署的资源需求。

Method: 提出Cotten4Rec，采用线性时间余弦相似度注意力机制，通过单一优化CUDA内核实现，减少中间缓存与内核启动开销。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的评估表明，相比BERT4Rec和LinRec，Cotten4Rec在保持推荐精度几乎不变的前提下，显著降低了内存占用和运行时间。

Conclusion: Cotten4Rec为计算资源受限的大规模实际序列推荐场景提供了可行的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) models predict a user's next interaction by modeling their historical behaviors. Transformer-based SR methods, notably BERT4Rec, effectively capture these patterns but incur significant computational overhead due to extensive intermediate computations associated with Softmax-based attention. We propose Cotten4Rec, a novel SR model utilizing linear-time cosine similarity attention, implemented through a single optimized compute unified device architecture (CUDA) kernel. By minimizing intermediate buffers and kernel-launch overhead, Cotten4Rec substantially reduces resource usage compared to BERT4Rec and the linear-attention baseline, LinRec, especially for datasets with moderate sequence lengths and vocabulary sizes. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets confirm that Cotten4Rec achieves considerable reductions in memory and runtime with minimal compromise in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating Cotten4Rec's viability as an efficient alternative for practical, large-scale sequential recommendation scenarios where computational resources are critical.

### [147] [Jackpot: Optimal Budgeted Rejection Sampling for Extreme Actor-Policy Mismatch Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06107)
*Zhuoming Chen,Hongyi Liu,Yang Zhou,Haizhong Zheng,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jackpot is a framework that uses Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to decouple rollout generation from policy optimization in reinforcement learning for LLMs, reducing distribution mismatch while maintaining training stability and performance comparable to on-policy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for large language models is computationally expensive due to costly rollout generation. While decoupling rollout from policy optimization could improve efficiency, it introduces severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. This work addresses this fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in LLM alignment.

Method: The Jackpot framework integrates three key components: (1) Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce rollout-policy distribution discrepancy, (2) a unified training objective that jointly updates both the policy and rollout models, and (3) efficient system implementation using top-k probability estimation and batch-level bias correction.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution toward the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, Jackpot demonstrates superior training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines and achieves performance parity with on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for 300 update steps with batch size 64.

Conclusion: OBRS-based alignment successfully enables practical decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for LLM reinforcement learning, substantially improving training efficiency and stability while maintaining competitive performance, marking a significant step toward scalable RL for large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' impressive reasoning capabilities, significant failures persist even in simple scenarios, and existing research is fragmented without systematic understanding of these shortcomings.

Method: Proposes a novel two-axis categorization framework: (1) Reasoning types: embodied vs non-embodied (subdivided into informal/intuitive and formal/logical), (2) Failure types: fundamental (architectural), application-specific, and robustness issues. Provides definitions, analyzes existing studies, explores root causes, and presents mitigation strategies for each category.

Result: Unifies fragmented research to provide a structured perspective on systemic LLM reasoning weaknesses, offers actionable insights, guides future research toward building more reliable and robust reasoning capabilities, and releases a comprehensive GitHub repository (https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures).

Conclusion: Systematic analysis and categorization of reasoning failures is essential for improving LLM reliability, providing a foundational framework that directs future research toward addressing these critical weaknesses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LTLfMT（有限迹上的线性时序逻辑模理论）的框架，用于在具有大规模/无限状态空间的马尔可夫决策过程中逻辑化指定非马尔可夫奖励，通过识别可处理的LTLfMT片段并结合奖励机与事后经验回放（HER）来解决奖励稀疏问题，在非线性算术理论的连续控制任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大规模或无限状态空间马尔可夫决策过程中非马尔可夫奖励的逻辑化描述难题，经典时序逻辑需要手动设计布尔谓词且表达能力有限，而LTLfMT虽能处理非结构化异构数据的复杂任务规范，却引入了显著的理论计算挑战。

Method: 理论层面识别出一个在无限状态空间上下文中既可处理又足够表达的非马尔可夫奖励规范LTLfMT片段；实践层面提出基于奖励机和事后经验回放（HER）的方法，将一阶逻辑规范转化为可执行策略并缓解奖励稀疏性问题。

Result: 在非线性算术理论的连续控制环境中，该框架支持复杂任务的自然规范表达；实验结果表明，针对复杂目标定制化的HER实现对于任务求解具有关键作用。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过可处理的LTLfMT片段与HER机制的结合，为大规模/无限状态MDP中的非马尔可夫奖励提供了一种统一、可重用的逻辑化指定方案，有效解决了复杂任务规范与奖励稀疏性的双重挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

TL;DR: GrAlgoBench是一个用于评估大型推理模型的图算法基准测试，揭示了当前模型在处理长上下文时准确率急剧下降以及存在无效自我验证导致的"过度思考"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型基准测试在数学、代码和常识推理方面存在局限性：缺乏长上下文评估、挑战性不足且难以通过程序化方式验证答案。因此需要新的评估工具来更全面地测试模型推理能力。

Method: 开发GrAlgoBench基准测试，通过图算法问题评估大型推理模型。图算法问题适合探测推理能力，因为它们需要长上下文推理、允许细粒度难度控制，并支持标准化程序化评估。在九项任务上进行了系统实验。

Result: 实验揭示当前大型推理模型的两大缺陷：1）上下文长度增加时准确率急剧下降，当图超过120个节点时准确率降至50%以下，主要由执行错误、记忆薄弱和冗余推理导致；2）存在"过度思考"现象，即大量无效的自我验证增加了推理痕迹但未提升正确性。

Conclusion: GrAlgoBench将图算法问题确立为严格、多维且实用的测试平台，有效暴露了当前大型推理模型在长上下文推理和验证效率方面的局限性，有助于推动推理研究的进展。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

TL;DR: 针对大型推理模型训练中GRPO存在的梯度信号衰减和计算效率问题，本文提出Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO)框架，通过在线难度估计器在回滚前筛选样本，实现计算资源优化，达到2倍成本削减且不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理过于简单或复杂问题时会出现组间优势消失，导致梯度信号易受噪声干扰、收敛稳定性下降。现有方法如DAPO虽缓解梯度消失，但未解决低效用样本穷尽回滚带来的高计算开销。

Method: 提出DEPO框架，集成在线难度估计器于回滚阶段前动态评估并过滤训练数据，优先分配计算资源给高学习潜力样本，以提升训练效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明DEPO可将回滚成本降低最高2倍，同时保持模型性能不下降，显著提升推理对齐的训练效率。

Conclusion: 该方法大幅降低高性能推理模型的训练计算门槛，为推理扩展的可持续发展提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: QA-Token是一种质量感知的分词方法，通过双层优化和强化学习将数据可靠性直接融入词表构建，在基因组学和金融任务中表现优异，并能零开销地解锁噪声真实世界数据用于基础模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分词方法处理序列数据时未考虑信号质量，限制了其在含噪声真实世界语料上的有效性，难以处理海量基因组序列和金融时间序列等噪声数据。

Method: 提出QA-Token，将数据可靠性直接融入词表构建：1）双层优化框架联合优化词表构建和下游性能；2）强化学习方法通过质量感知奖励学习合并策略并提供收敛保证；3）通过Gumbel-Softmax松弛实现自适应参数学习和端到端优化。

Result: 实验显示：基因组学变体识别F1值比BPE提升6.7个百分点；金融夏普比率提升30%；在1.7万亿碱基的预训练语料上实现最先进病原体检测（94.53 MCC），同时减少15%的词元数量。

Conclusion: QA-Token成功解锁了包含数PB基因组序列和TB级金融时间序列的噪声真实世界语料，可用于基础模型训练且推理开销为零，展现了在实际应用中的重大价值。

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了大语言模型在长程推理中的根本限制源于自回归生成过程的不稳定性而非任务复杂度，提出决策优势随执行长度指数衰减的理论，并论证了离散分段的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将LLMs长程推理失败归因于任务复杂度（如组合搜索爆炸或长期信用分配问题），但忽略了即使在无分支的线性任务中，自回归执行本身也存在固有的稳定性极限。

Method: 通过理论推导提出Theorem A，证明单路径自回归推理中的决策优势呈指数衰减；在合成环境和真实TextWorld任务中进行实证研究，观察性能悬崖现象。

Result: 发现了与理论预测一致的可观察性能悬崖，证实长程推理需要离散分段，自然诱导图状执行结构（如DAG），并指出短期评估可能掩盖结构不稳定性。

Conclusion: 从动力学视角解释了长程推理失败，表明纯粹自回归架构在维持长期连贯性方面存在根本限制，未来推理系统应从单纯扩展转向结构化治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents AgentCPM-Explore, a 4B-parameter agent model that systematically addresses three key bottlenecks (catastrophic forgetting, reward noise sensitivity, and reasoning degradation) through a novel training framework. The model achieves SOTA performance at its scale, matches or exceeds larger 8B models, and even outperforms massive models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agent systems heavily rely on large-scale models while the capabilities of edge-scale models (around 4B parameters) remain largely underexplored. The authors aim to conduct the first systematic study on training agentic models at this scale and unlock their underestimated potential.

Method: The authors propose a holistic training framework with three key components: (1) parameter-space model fusion to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during SFT, (2) reward signal denoising to address RL sensitivity to noise, and (3) contextual information refinement to counter reasoning degradation from redundant long-context information. This framework is applied to develop AgentCPM-Explore.

Result: AgentCPM-Explore achieves SOTA performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and outperforms larger models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, it reaches 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64 evaluation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling but rather inference stability. The proposed training framework effectively unlocks the significant, previously underestimated potential of compact 4B-parameter models, challenging the assumption that larger models are always necessary for high performance.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

Motivation: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility: static rubrics lack adaptability while LLM-as-judge approaches suffer from instability and bias.

Method: Proposes JADE, a two-layer framework: Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as predefined evaluation skills for stable criteria; Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims.

Result: Experiments on BizBench show JADE improves evaluation stability, reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM evaluators, aligns strongly with expert rubrics, and transfers effectively to a medical-domain benchmark.

Conclusion: JADE successfully validates across professional domains, demonstrating its effectiveness as a robust evaluation framework for agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

TL;DR: HyPER is a training-free online control policy that dynamically reallocates test-time computation in mixture-of-experts models by adaptively balancing exploration and exploitation, achieving 8-10% accuracy improvement while reducing token usage by 25-40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exploration-exploitation trade-off in multi-path reasoning is phase-dependent, and correct/incorrect paths often diverge only at late stages; existing methods (rigid tree search or redundant parallel paths) fail to adaptively balance this trade-off.

Method: Reformulates test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a hypothesis pool; proposes HyPER with an online controller for phase-aware transition, token-level refinement for efficient exploitation without full-path resampling, and length- and confidence-aware answer aggregation.

Result: Evaluated on four MoE language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks, HyPER consistently achieves superior accuracy-compute trade-offs: +8-10% accuracy gain and -25-40% token reduction compared to baselines.

Conclusion: HyPER provides an effective, training-free solution for dynamic test-time compute allocation in MoE architectures, demonstrating that adaptive control of exploration-exploitation phases significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

TL;DR: 该论文针对大语言模型智能体训练中强化学习算法在多轮场景下缺乏收敛保证的问题，提出SeeUPO——一种无价值函数方法，通过将多轮交互建模为序贯多智能体老虎机问题并逆向更新策略，在理论上保证收敛性，并在AppWorld和BFCL v4基准测试中实现43-55%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法在训练大语言模型智能体时，缺乏在多轮交互场景下的收敛性保证，导致训练不稳定且无法收敛到最优策略。主流算法无法同时满足无价值函数和收敛保证两个条件。

Method: 论文系统分析了策略更新机制与优势估计方法的组合效应，发现REINFORCE+GRAE可在无折扣条件下收敛到全局最优，但PPO+GRAE会破坏PPO的单调改进特性。为此提出SeeUPO（序列级序贯更新策略优化），将多轮交互建模为序贯执行的多智能体老虎机问题，通过逆向回合式策略更新，利用逆向归纳法确保单调改进和全局最优收敛。

Result: 在AppWorld和BFCL v4基准测试上，SeeUPO相比现有骨干算法表现出显著优势：Qwen3-14B模型获得43.3%-54.6%的相对提升，Qwen2.5-14B获得24.1%-41.9%的提升（基准测试平均），同时具备更优的训练稳定性。理论证明REINFORCE+GRAE具有全局收敛性，而PPO+GRAE会丧失单调改进性质。

Conclusion: SeeUPO成功提供了一种具有理论收敛保证的无价值函数强化学习算法，解决了多轮大语言模型智能体训练的收敛难题，在性能和稳定性上均显著优于现有主流方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示视觉语言模型(VLM)在保持预测输出不变的同时，内部表示可能发生接近图像间差异程度的漂移，且模型规模扩大并不能提升鲁棒性，反而可能因决策边界更尖锐而更脆弱，为此提出了一种包含内部嵌入漂移、频谱敏感性和结构平滑性的全面评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM鲁棒性评估仅关注输出不变性，隐含假设稳定预测反映稳定多模态处理，此假设不足。需要更深入评估内部表示稳定性，揭示模型真实脆弱性。

Method: 提出表示感知和频率感知评估框架，测量内部嵌入漂移、频谱敏感性和结构平滑性(视觉token空间一致性)，结合标准标签指标，在SEEDBench、MMMU和POPE数据集上测试现代VLMs。

Result: 发现三种失效模式：1)模型预测不变但内部表示漂移显著，文本叠加等扰动下漂移量接近图像间差异；2)更大模型准确率更高但鲁棒性未改善，敏感度相等或更高；3)扰动对任务影响不同：破坏粗/细视觉线索组合损害推理，但使模型更保守从而减少幻觉假阳性。

Conclusion: 输出级不变性不足以保证VLM鲁棒性，内部表示稳定性至关重要；模型扩展不提升鲁棒性，反而产生更尖锐脆弱的决策边界；所提框架能揭示标准指标忽略的深层脆弱性，为未来鲁棒性改进提供方向。

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

TL;DR: 提出ARK自回归知识图谱生成模型，将图视为三元组序列学习隐式语义约束，在IntelliGraphs基准上达到89.2-100%语义有效性；并引入变分扩展SAIL实现可控生成，发现模型容量比深度更重要，循环架构效率优于Transformer


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱生成需学习三元组间复杂语义依赖并维持领域有效性约束，与独立评分的链接预测不同，生成模型必须捕捉整个子图的相互依赖关系以产生语义连贯的结构

Method: 提出ARK自回归模型家族，将知识图谱视为(head, relation, tail)三元组序列进行生成；通过数据直接学习类型一致性、时序有效性和关系模式等隐式约束，无需显式规则监督；开发SAIL变分扩展，通过学习的潜在表示实现无条件采样和基于部分图的有条件补全

Result: 在IntelliGraphs基准测试中，模型在多个数据集上实现89.2%-100.0%语义有效性，并生成训练中未见的新图谱；分析表明模型容量(隐藏维度≥64)比架构深度更重要；循环架构与基于Transformer的替代方案达到相当的有效性，但计算效率显著更高

Conclusion: 自回归模型为知识图谱生成提供了有效框架，在知识库补全和问答等实际应用中具有潜力

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习旨在学习可泛化至任意未见任务的单一通用策略。尽管LTL已成功用于RL任务规范，但现有方法在效率和表达能力上存在局限，难以扩展到复杂LTL规范。

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究神经符号贝叶斯学习器中的主动概念学习权衡，比较基于最大期望信息增益（EIG）的理性策略与类人正向测试策略（PTS）。研究发现EIG在需要证伪的复杂规则中有效，但在简单概念上因支持不匹配陷阱而表现不佳；PTS虽信息次优，但通过选择"安全"查询维持了提议分布有效性，在简单规则上收敛更快。这表明"确认偏误"可能是人类思维在稀疏假设空间中保持可处理推理的理性适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动概念学习需要在查询信息量与学习者稳定性之间取得平衡。现有研究缺乏对现代大规模语言模型（LLM）作为假设生成器时该权衡的理解，特别是在开放假设空间中贝叶斯更新的可行性问题。

Method: 构建神经符号贝叶斯学习框架：使用LLM生成可执行程序作为假设，通过贝叶斯更新重新加权。在经典数字游戏任务中比较两种查询策略：1）理性主动学习者最大化近似期望信息增益（EIG）；2）类人正向测试策略（PTS）查询当前最优假设下的正例预测。分析策略性能差异及其机制。

Result: 1. EIG在需证伪的复合或含例外规则中有效，但在简单概念上表现差于PTS；2. EIG失败源于支持不匹配——高诊断性边界查询使后验集中于LLM生成器易产生无效或过度特定程序的假设区域，导致粒子近似失效；3. PTS虽信息量次优，但通过选择"安全"查询维持提议分布有效性，实现更快收敛。

Conclusion: 研究揭示"确认偏误"可能并非认知错误，而是人类在稀疏、开放假设空间中保持推理可行性的理性适应策略，为理解人类概念学习的计算原理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了异构环境和隐私约束下的联邦学习训练不稳定问题，实现了更稳定、高效的模型优化。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

Abstract: Can AI agents predict whether they will succeed at a task? We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.
