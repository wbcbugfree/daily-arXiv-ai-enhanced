This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence.

Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop.

Modeling such rich contextual signals and\ntheir intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge.\nAlthough numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search\nmethods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual\ninformation, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced\ngenerative search framework for better \\textbf{understanding the complicated\ncontext}.

This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a\nstatistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of\nsource-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their\ninteraction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by\nmanipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level\nby varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled\nexperiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays\nin-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)\nfactual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some\ncases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity\nbecomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity\nprohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.\nBeyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical\ngeneralization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.\nThis shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level\nimpacts different generalization aspects.

Existing\nresearch focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices\nsource domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a\nfine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains).

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies.

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then\nemployed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the\nattachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a\nhierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to\naccelerate the reinforcement learning.

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and\ncounterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:\nhttps://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL."}

In\nthis work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential\nbasis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made\nat irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based\npredictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state\nrepresentation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular\nobservations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)\nobservation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state\nusing learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous\ntime. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on\nnext-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can\nindeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and\nreasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and\nautonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations\nfor explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in\nthe evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,\ncritical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,\ntrustworthy LLM explanations."}

In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI.

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then\nemployed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the\nattachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a\nhierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to\naccelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot\ndetection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the\nperformance of GNN-based detectors."}

In this\nstudy, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and\nfine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction\nmethods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing\ndifferent self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it\nreduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited\noptimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.\nInterestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline\ndemonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency.

This inconsistency raises a\ncritical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data\ndistribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a\nconservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and\nthus unable to discover completely novel solutions.

Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction\neffects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;\nzero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection\nunderperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and\nDeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs\ncompetitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis\nfor relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute\ndifferences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across\nprompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer\nattractive F1 at a small incremental cost.

To appear in IJCNN 2025", "summary": "Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex\nargumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim\netc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an\nargumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with\nthis task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of\nthe recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by\nflattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study\njointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using\nAutoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The\nproposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction\nframework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework\nmodels the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions\nwith the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build\nthe argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to\ncapture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP\nachieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks\nand delivers strong results in one benchmark."}

The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements.

We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications.

This\nlow-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons\nexchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and\ninter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant\nparameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal\nstability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the\ncontraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence\nprocessing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities\ncorrespond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the\nneural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.\nEmpirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate\nimproved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate\ncompression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and\ncross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude\nby discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured\nneuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional\nlearning systems."}

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale\natmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which\nexhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to\nobtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)\ndemonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve\nensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but\nthis method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency\nadequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex\nrelationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while\nmaintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer\npromising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study\nevaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification\nmechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models\ndistribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space\nsampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models\nare trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts\nto regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that\nprobabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty\nrepresentations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic\nmodel offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,\ndeterministic skill, and physical consistency.

For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier.

This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a\nstatistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of\nsource-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their\ninteraction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by\nmanipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level\nby varying which statistical streams each fact appears in.

In some\ncases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity\nbecomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity\nprohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.\nBeyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical\ngeneralization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.\nThis shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level\nimpacts different generalization aspects.

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery.

Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically\ntesting candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our\napproach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable\nreuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five\nbenchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer\nconsistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at\nsignificantly lower component costs compared to our baselines.

However, recent work has largely focused on applying\nnew methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,\nshying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus\non data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation\ntasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,\nand single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With\nour data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family\nof 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative\nrejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges\nlarger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for\nopen-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static\nbenchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,\nFARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,\nFARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.\nstring-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned\nFARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality."}

Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable\ncode, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent\ntechnical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.
