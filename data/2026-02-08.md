### [1] [BioACE: An Automated Framework for Biomedical Answer and Citation Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04982)
*Deepak Gupta,Davis Bartels,Dina Demner-Fuhsman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical LLM-generated answers and citations across completeness/correctness/precision/recall dimensions, validated against human assessments


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of biomedical LLM outputs requires scarce expert verification to ensure factual consistency with scientific literature and medical terminology, creating a bottleneck in quality assessment

Method: Develops automated metrics for answer completeness/correctness/precision/recall against ground-truth nuggets; employs NLI, pre-trained models and LLMs to evaluate citation quality; conducts correlation analysis with human evaluations

Result: Achieves strong correlation between automated metrics and human judgment; identifies optimal approaches for biomedical answer/citation evaluation within BioACE framework

Conclusion: BioACE provides validated automated evaluation methodology that addresses expert dependency in biomedical text generation assessment, with implementation available as open-source package

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

### [2] [CoWork-X: Experience-Optimized Co-Evolution for Multi-Agent Collaboration System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05004)
*Zexin Lin,Jiachen Yu,Haoyang Zhang,Yuzhao Li,Zhonghang Li,Yujiu Yang,Junjie Wang,Xiaoqiang Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoWork-X is an active co-evolution framework that separates fast in-episode skill execution from slow post-episode optimization to achieve real-time coordination and sustained adaptation under token budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highly cooperative tasks require both sub-second real-time coordination and multi-episode adaptation under strict online token budgets, which existing approaches fail to satisfy simultaneously—either causing latency/jitter through in-episode reasoning, or delivering unstructured post-episode improvements that are difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution.

Method: The framework implements a Skill-Agent using HTN-based skill retrieval from a structured skill library for fast execution, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization, inspired by fast-slow memory separation.

Result: On Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks, CoWork-X demonstrates stable cumulative performance improvements while progressively reducing online latency and token consumption.

Conclusion: The active co-evolution approach successfully decouples real-time execution from offline optimization, achieving both immediate coordination and long-term adaptation under computational constraints.

Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.

### [3] [Capacity Constraints and the Multilingual Penalty for Lexical Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05035)
*Sean Trott,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual language models exhibit a "multilingual penalty" in lexical disambiguation tasks due to three capacity constraints: reduced embedding isotropy (representational), diminished attention to disambiguating cues (attentional), and increased multi-token segmentation (vocabulary-related). These factors collectively explain the performance gap previously attributed solely to multilingual training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why multilingual language models (LMs) underperform monolingual counterparts in semantic tasks, specifically quantifying the "multilingual penalty" for lexical disambiguation—a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization—and identify underlying capacity limitations.

Method: Compared monolingual and multilingual LMs from identical model families using controlled human-judgment datasets for ambiguous English/Spanish words. Analyzed three capacity constraints: (1) representational (embedding isotropy), (2) attentional (focus on disambiguating cues), and (3) vocabulary-related (multi-token segmentation). Statistical mediation tested if these constraints explained performance variance.

Result: Multilingual LMs consistently underperformed monolingual counterparts in lexical disambiguation. All three capacity constraints were evident in multilingual models: reduced embedding isotropy, weaker attention to contextual cues, and higher multi-token segmentation rates. Crucially, these constraints statistically mediated the relationship between multilingual status and performance degradation, accounting for the variance previously ascribed to multilingualism alone.

Conclusion: The multilingual penalty in semantic tasks stems from quantifiable capacity constraints (representational, attentional, vocabulary) rather than multilingualism inherently. Improving these constraints—e.g., via optimized architecture or training—could mitigate performance gaps, shifting focus from "multilingual vs. monolingual" to capacity allocation efficiency.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

### [4] [Locas: Your Models are Principled Initializers of Locally-Supported Parametric Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05085)
*Sidi Lu,Zhenwen Liang,Dongyang Ma,Yan Wang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Locas is a locally-supported parametric memory for transformers that enables parameter- and computation-efficient continual learning with only 0.02% additional parameters through principled initialization using model parameters, activations, and gradients, effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge test-time-training with flexible parametric memory that can be offloaded from or merged into model parameters, addressing efficient continual learning in LLMs while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes Locas: a low-rank sideway-FFN memory architecture sharing transformer FFN design. Two variants: conventional two-layer MLP (theoretical guarantee) and GLU-FFN (SOTA LLM compatibility). Uses principled initialization by reusing model parameters, activations, and/or gradients for fast convergence and generalization.

Result: Achieves 0.02% parameter overhead, stores past context with reduced context windows, and maintains minimal catastrophic forgetting on MMLU after memorizing whole books, demonstrating effective parametric knowledge permanentization.

Conclusion: Locas successfully permanentizes past context into parametric knowledge with minimal forgetting, showing promising ability for efficient continual learning while preserving existing model knowledge through its flexible memory mechanism.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

### [5] [Data Kernel Perspective Space Performance Guarantees for Synthetic Data from Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05106)
*Michael Browder,Kevin Duh,J. David Harris,Vince Lyzinski,Paul McNamee,Youngser Park,Carey E. Priebe,Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS), a mathematical framework providing statistical guarantees for synthetic data quality from transformer models to address unpredictable LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data scarcity is a critical bottleneck for language technology. While LLMs generate synthetic data, their black-box nature makes output properties unpredictable, forcing engineers to empirically tune parameters like temperature without performance guarantees.

Method: Introduces Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) - a mathematical framework that derives performance guarantees for transformer outputs through formal analysis, applicable to downstream tasks including neural machine translation and CPO-trained LLMs.

Result: Demonstrates that DKPS provides concrete statistical guarantees for synthetic data quality and can elucidate performance of downstream models, offering theoretical foundation beyond trial-and-error approaches.

Conclusion: DKPS establishes rigorous mathematical analysis for predictable synthetic data generation from transformers, enabling theoretically grounded quality guarantees rather than empirical parameter tuning, though current limitations require further research.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

### [6] [Multilingual Extraction and Recognition of Implicit Discourse Relations in Speech and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05107)
*Ahmed Ruby,Christian Hardmeier,Sara Stymne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal (text + audio) and multilingual (English, French, Spanish) framework using Qwen2-Audio for implicit discourse relation classification, demonstrating that cross-lingual transfer and modality fusion improve low-resource language performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only models fail to capture contextual cues distributed across modalities (text/audio) and languages, hindering implicit discourse relation classification which requires nuanced context inference.

Method: 1) Automatically constructs multilingual-multimodal dataset via distant supervision for unrelated language pairs; 2) Integrates textual and acoustic features using Qwen2-Audio for joint cross-lingual modeling.

Result: Text-based models outperform audio-only models, but multimodal fusion enhances overall performance; cross-lingual transfer significantly boosts accuracy for low-resource languages (e.g., French/Spanish).

Conclusion: Multimodal integration and cross-lingual transfer are effective strategies for implicit discourse relation classification, especially for languages with limited annotated data.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

### [7] [GreekMMLU: A Native-Sourced Multitask Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Greek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05150)
*Yang Zhang,Mersin Konomi,Christos Xypolopoulos,Konstantinos Divriotis,Konstantinos Skianis,Giannis Nikolentzos,Giorgos Stamou,Guokan Shang,Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GreekMMLU基准，包含21,805道源自希腊本土的多选题，涵盖45个学科领域，用于评估大语言模型的希腊语理解能力，发现前沿模型与开源模型、希腊适配模型与通用多语言模型之间存在显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有希腊语评估基准多由英语机器翻译而来，无法体现希腊语言文化特性，缺乏基于真实本土内容的可靠评测工具。

Method: 构建希腊本土大规模多任务语言理解基准GreekMMLU，包含45个学科领域的21,805道多选题，采用新学科分类体系并标注从基础教育到专业考试的教育难度等级；公开16,857个样本，保留4,948个用于私有排行榜。

Result: 对80余个开放与闭源大模型评估显示，前沿模型与开源权重模型间、希腊适配模型与通用多语言模型间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析模型规模、适配方式和提示策略等因素，为提升大模型希腊语能力提供改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multilingual corpora that include Greek, yet reliable evaluation benchmarks for Greek-particularly those based on authentic, native-sourced content-remain limited. Existing datasets are often machine-translated from English, failing to capture Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics. We introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, comprising 21,805 multiple-choice questions across 45 subject areas, organized under a newly defined subject taxonomy and annotated with educational difficulty levels spanning primary to professional examinations. All questions are sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. We publicly release 16,857 samples and reserve 4,948 samples for a private leaderboard to enable robust and contamination-resistant evaluation. Evaluations of over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of factors influencing performance-including model scale, adaptation, and prompting-and derive insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek.

### [8] [Among Us: Measuring and Mitigating Malicious Contributions in Model Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05176)
*Ziyuan Yang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities in multi-LLM collaboration systems by creating malicious models and testing their impact, then proposes mitigation strategies using external supervisors that recover most performance but don't fully solve the problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models increasingly collaborate in decentralized systems, there's a critical safety concern: what if some participating models are compromised or malicious? This research quantifies that risk and explores potential defenses.

Method: The authors engineered four categories of malicious LMs, integrated them into four popular multi-LLM collaboration systems, and evaluated performance across 10 datasets to measure the impact of compromised models.

Result: Malicious models cause severe performance degradation (7.12% in reasoning, 7.94% in safety domains on average). Proposed external supervisor mitigation strategies recover 95.31% of performance on average, but complete resistance remains unsolved.

Conclusion: While external supervision can significantly mitigate the impact of malicious models in multi-LLM systems, achieving full resistance to compromised components is still an open research challenge.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

*Shangbin Feng,Kishan Panaganti,Yulia Tsvetkov,Wenhao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出模型协作蒸馏与单多进化循环框架，通过将多模型协作模式蒸馏为单一模型实现高效推理，并让模型在协作-蒸馏-再协作的循环中自主演化。实验表明：蒸馏模型平均提升8.0%，进化后协作系统提升14.9%，优于现有进化方法且兼容多种设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型协作能结合多个语言模型的优势，但存在加载多个模型成本高昂的问题。需要在保持协作优势的同时提升效率。

Method: 提出两种核心方法：1) 协作蒸馏：将多模型协作的输出模式蒸馏到单一模型中，推理时仅使用蒸馏模型；2) 单多进化循环：多个模型先协作，各自从协作输出中蒸馏学习，再用蒸馏后改进的模型进行新一轮协作，形成自主演化的生态系统。

Result: 在7种协作策略和15项任务（问答、推理、事实性等）上的实验显示：1) 单个蒸馏模型平均性能提升8.0%，以单模型成本获得协作优势；2) 进化循环使协作系统性能进一步提升14.9%；3) 优于多种现有进化AI方法；4) 兼容不同模型架构、协作策略和蒸馏配置；5) 能有效解决初始模型难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了模型协作优势与单模型推理效率的统一，单多进化循环创造了一个有效的自改进生态系统，为构建高效、协同的AI系统提供了新范式，具有广泛的适用性和实用价值。

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

*Hsuan-Yu Chou,Wajiha Naveed,Shuyan Zhou,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估开源与闭源大语言模型在社交媒体内容审核中的性能，发现两者表现相当，支持在消费级硬件上实现隐私保护的审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理型大语言模型最新进展的驱动，评估开源模型是否能在内容审核任务中匹配闭源模型，以解决隐私和硬件可及性问题。

Method: 在真实Bluesky帖子上测试七种先进模型（4种闭源，3种开源），将其审核决策与Bluesky审核服务和人工标注进行对比分析。

Result: 开源模型表现出与闭源模型相当的敏感度（81%-97%）和特异度（91%-100%）vs（72%-98%，93%-99%）。粗鲁检测特异度高于敏感度，但不容忍和威胁检测相反。评估者间一致性分析为部署提供见解。

Conclusion: 开源大模型可在消费级硬件上实现隐私保护的内容审核，为设计平衡社区价值观与个人用户偏好的审核系统提供新方向。

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

*Kenichiro Ando,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究调查了LLM引用行为与人类偏好的对齐情况，发现模型在医疗文本上过度引用(达27%)，但对数字和人名句子的引用不足(-22.6%和-20.1%)，可通过DPO校准改善对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究关注LLM应引用哪些文档，但LLM如何识别"值得引用"的内容以及如何控制这一过程仍缺乏探索。理解LLM引用行为与人类偏好的差异对提升可信度至关重要。

Method: 构建包含8种引用动机的数据集，对网页文本进行细粒度分类，并通过成对偏好评估全面比较人类与LLM在不同类型组合下的引用行为差异。

Result: 1) 人类最频繁寻求医疗文本引用，强模型也显示类似倾向；2) 模型对显式标记需引用的文本过度引用率达27%，降低对齐准确率；3) 系统性低估数字句子(-22.6%)和含人名句子(-20.1%)的引用需求；4) 直接偏好优化(DPO)可有效校准模型行为以匹配人类偏好。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前LLM引用行为的系统性偏差，为未来更精细化的LLM引用偏好研究奠定了基础，并证明了通过偏好优化改善对齐的可行性。

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bagpiper是一个80亿参数的音频基础模型，通过富描述字幕和"先描述后处理"工作流，实现了统一的音频理解与生成，性能超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基础模型依赖僵化的任务特定监督，仅处理音频的孤立因素，而人类智能能够整体性处理音频，无缝连接物理信号与抽象认知概念以执行复杂任务。

Method: 提出Bagpiper模型，使用富描述字幕（包含转写、音频事件等关键认知概念的全面自然语言描述）解释音频信号；在6000亿token大规模语料上预训练，建立原始音频与高级概念空间的双向映射；微调时采用"先描述后处理"流程，模拟中间认知推理步骤，无需任务特定先验。

Result: 在MMAU和AIRBench音频理解基准测试中超越Qwen-2.5-Omni；在生成质量上超越CosyVoice3和TangoFlux；能够合成语音、音乐和音效的任意组合。

Conclusion: Bagpiper是首批实现通用音频统一理解与生成的研究工作之一，验证了模拟人类整体性认知处理方式的有效性。

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

### [13] [FedMosaic: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Parametric Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05235)
*Zhilin Liang,Yuxiang Wang,Zimu Zhou,Hainan Zhang,Boyi Liu,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出FedMosaic，首个基于参数化适配器的联邦RAG框架，通过将语义相关文档聚类为多文档适配器并选择性聚合，解决隐私敏感场景下的知识孤岛问题，在提升准确率的同时大幅降低存储和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG假设集中式文档库，这在具有分布式知识孤岛的隐私敏感领域不可行。联邦RAG虽能保护隐私，但面临两大挑战：单文档适配器导致高存储通信成本，以及无差别合并多个适配器引发的破坏性聚合。

Method: FedMosaic采用参数化RAG：1）通过文档特定掩码将语义相关文档聚类为多文档适配器，降低开销同时保持特异性；2）执行选择性适配器聚合，仅合并相关性对齐且无冲突的适配器。

Result: 在四个类别上平均准确率比SOTA方法高10.9%，存储成本降低78.8%-86.3%，通信成本降低91.4%，且从不共享原始文档。

Conclusion: FedMosaic通过智能文档聚类和选择性适配器合并，成功解决了联邦RAG中的关键挑战，实现了高效且准确的隐私保护型检索增强生成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters.

*Guangwei Zhang,Jianing Zhu,Cheng Qian,Neil Gong,Rada Mihalcea,Zhaozhuo Xu,Jingrui He,Jiaqi Ma,Yun Huang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li,Ahmed Abbasi,Dongwon Lee,Heng Ji,Denghui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Copyright Detective is an interactive forensic system that detects LLM copyright infringement by treating it as evidence discovery rather than simple classification. It combines multiple detection paradigms (recall testing, similarity analysis, jailbreak probing, unlearning verification) to audit verbatim and paraphrased content leakage, enabling responsible AI deployment even with black-box model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Copyright law's complexity makes infringement detection a nuanced evidence discovery challenge rather than a static classification task. There's a critical need for systematic auditing tools to support responsible LLM deployment and transparent copyright risk evaluation, particularly given the constraint of black-box model access.

Method: Developed an interactive forensic framework that integrates four detection paradigms: content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification. The system employs interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows within a unified, extensible architecture to systematically audit both verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage.

Result: Created the first interactive forensic system capable of detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs, demonstrating systematic auditing capabilities for copyright infringement detection even under black-box access conditions.

Conclusion: The system provides an evidence-based approach to copyright risk assessment, enabling responsible AI deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright compliance through comprehensive, multi-paradigm forensic analysis.

Abstract: We present Copyright Detective, the first interactive forensic system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs. The system treats copyright infringement versus compliance as an evidence discovery process rather than a static classification task due to the complex nature of copyright law. It integrates multiple detection paradigms, including content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification, within a unified and extensible framework. Through interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows, our system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks even with black-box access.

TL;DR: 提出CoPE方法，通过软截断RoPE的低频分量，统一了OOD缓解与语义建模两个目标，在256k上下文长度下实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RoPE长文本扩展方法存在两类分离的指导思想：分布外缓解和语义建模，缺乏统一框架

Method: CoPE：对RoPE进行软截断低通滤波，保留低频成分，消除硬截断导致的光谱泄漏

Result: 显著性能提升，可扩展至256k上下文长度，在长度泛化任务上达到新SOTA

Conclusion: 软截断策略有效统一了OOD消除与语义精炼目标，验证了理论分析，为长文本建模提供了新方案

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

*Fanfan Liu,Youyang Yin,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Zhixiong Zeng,Haibo Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes response length variation patterns in RLVR algorithms, proposes LUSPO to eliminate length bias in GSPO, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLVR training increases response length (considered crucial for reasoning), different algorithms exhibit significantly varied length change patterns. The fundamental causes remain unclear, and existing methods like GSPO suffer from inherent length bias that causes response length collapse.

Method: Conducts theoretical analysis of mainstream RLVR algorithm components to identify length-influencing factors, then proposes Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) which rectifies GSPO's length bias by making its loss function unbiased toward response length.

Result: LUSPO successfully resolves response length collapse, demonstrates superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, and establishes a new state-of-the-art optimization strategy outperforming GRPO and GSPO.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework explains response length dynamics in RLVR training, and LUSPO provides an effective solution to length bias, offering a novel and superior optimization approach for enhancing LLM/VLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个设计科学框架，引入协作增益度量（$Γ$）和系统性多智能体系统（MAS）因素库，旨在将当前基于经验试错的研究范式转变为严谨的科学体系，推动集体人工智能的科学化进程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型显著提升了多智能体系统能力，但该领域仍缺乏统一的科学框架，依赖经验试错。存在两个核心问题：一是缺乏结构化因素分类法，导致调整无方向；二是缺乏统一度量标准，无法区分真正的协作增益与资源堆砌效应。

Method: 倡导向设计科学转型：1）建立协作增益度量（$Γ$）作为科学标准，分离内在增益与预算影响；2）提出因素归因范式，系统识别驱动协作的关键因素；3）构建系统性MAS因素库，将设计空间结构化分为控制级预设和信息级动力学两个维度。

Result: 形成了一套集成框架，使研究从盲目实验转向严谨科学，为实现真正的集体人工智能科学奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统研究提供了可重复、可验证的科学方法论，标志着从经验驱动到理论驱动的范式转变，开辟了"集体人工智能"的科学化路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

*Haojin Wang,Yike Wang,Shangbin Feng,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MentorCollab, a sparse inference-time collaboration method where large reasoning models (LRMs) selectively guide small language models (SLMs) only at divergence points, using lightweight verification to improve SLM reasoning with minimal mentor token usage (18.4% avg).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs and redundant reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs) versus inefficient multi-step reasoning in small language models (SLMs); existing collaboration methods cause verbose outputs without consistent error correction.

Method: At randomly sampled token positions, probes for divergences between SLM and LRM; uses a lightweight verifier to decide whether SLM should adopt a short mentor lookahead segment or continue independently.

Result: Improves performance in 12 of 15 SLM-LRM pairs across math, knowledge, and commonsense reasoning; achieves average 3.0% accuracy gain (up to 8.0%) with only 18.4% of tokens generated by the expensive LRM.

Conclusion: Selective sparse guidance during inference effectively transfers LRM reasoning capabilities to SLMs without significant computational overhead, demonstrating sufficient minimal intervention for optimal collaboration.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

*Soma Sato,Ryohei Sasano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals the mechanisms behind language models' implicit character-level knowledge encoding, identifying tokenization-dependent factors (merge rules, orthographic constraints) and tokenization-independent factors (semantic associations, syntactic information) as key contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models implicitly encode character-level information without explicit character-level training, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored.

Method: Comparative analysis of LMs trained under controlled settings (specified pre-training dataset/tokenizer) versus standard settings, categorizing contributing factors by tokenization dependency.

Result: Merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary tokenization-dependent factors, while semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information are key tokenization-independent factors.

Conclusion: Character-level knowledge in LMs emerges from both tokenization processes and internal linguistic properties, providing a mechanistic explanation for implicit character-level encoding.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文挑战大语言模型推理对齐的"采样规模越大越好"假设，揭示过度探索会引发性能下降和策略崩溃。提出的PACE方法以极小的探索预算(2<N<3)通过生成式纠正策略从失败样本中合成高质量偏好对，在性能超越DPO-R1(N=16)的同时计算成本降低80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO-R1依赖Best-of-N采样(N≥8)挖掘黄金轨迹，但作者发现数学推理中存在反直觉现象：扩大N值会放大验证器噪声并导致分布偏移，造成收益递减甚至灾难性策略崩溃，挑战了当前的扩展假设。

Method: 提出PACE(Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration)，用生成式纠正策略取代暴力挖掘。该方法以极小的探索预算(2<N<3)，从失败的探索轨迹中合成高保真偏好对，实现更稳健的策略对齐。

Result: 实证评估表明，PACE在仅使用约1/5计算资源的情况下性能优于DPO-R1(N=16)，并且对奖励攻击和标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究否定了"采样规模越大越好"的扩展假设，证明适度探索结合智能纠正比盲目扩大采样更有效。PACE为高效且稳健的大语言模型推理对齐提供了新范式。

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

TL;DR: This study reveals a widening performance gap between English and Arabic medical QA tasks in LLMs, driven by Arabic tokenization fragmentation and unreliable model confidence, calling for language-aware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are predominantly English-centric, causing performance degradation in low-resource languages like Arabic for critical medical applications, but the fundamental reasons for this gap remain unclear.

Method: Cross-lingual empirical analysis comparing LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question-answering, supplemented by tokenization analysis and reliability assessment of model confidence/explanations.

Result: Three key findings: (1) a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with task complexity; (2) structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text tokenization; (3) weak correlation between model-reported confidence/explanations and actual correctness.

Conclusion: The study underscores the urgent need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in medical LLMs to ensure equitable performance across linguistic communities.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

Conclusion: 该交互式LLM-Cypher框架有效降低了知识图谱的使用门槛，为非专家用户提供了精确查询的途径，同时揭示了不同领域下模型性能的差异性，为知识图谱的可访问性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

TL;DR: Proposing IESR, a lightweight LLM framework that enhances Text-to-SQL through information-enhanced structured reasoning with MCTS-based multi-path inference and trajectory consistency verification, achieving SOTA performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods exhibit three critical limitations: (1) weak complex reasoning and domain knowledge handling, (2) poor performance on hypothetical queries, and (3) high enterprise deployment costs, necessitating a more robust and efficient solution.

Method: The IESR framework employs a three-stage architecture: (i) LLM-based information extraction and schema linking with decoupled computation-SQL generation, (ii) Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) multi-path reasoning with majority voting ensemble, and (iii) trajectory consistency verification using a discriminator model to validate reasoning paths.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy (24.28 EX on LogicCat, 37.28 EX on Archer) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning, demonstrating significant improvement over existing approaches on complex reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: IESR successfully addresses Text-to-SQL limitations through structured reasoning, while analysis reveals fundamental deficiencies in current coder models' physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning capabilities, guiding future research directions.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM-as-a-judge框架，通过分类成人前序话语类型并评估儿童话语在扩展性(Expansion)和独立性(Independence)两个维度上的表现，取代基于长度的传统指标，实现对话质量的上下文感知评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有儿童语言评估指标（MLU、词汇多样性、可读性指数）受限于长度主导和上下文不敏感，无法捕捉推理深度、话题维持和话语规划等对话质量关键维度。

Method: 设计两阶段LLM评估流程：首先分类Previous Adult Utterance Type，随后从扩展性（上下文详述、推理深度、从句合并、因果/对比连接）和独立性（话语主动性、话题控制、自我调节、听众设计）两个维度评分。

Result: 所提指标呈现发展效度（年龄相关模式）、预测效度（超越基线的年龄估计性能）、语义敏感性（话语关系差异检测），并与人类判断高度一致，支持大规模自动化评估。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从测量话语长度到评估儿童在对话中意义建构贡献的范式转变，捕捉了儿童语言发展的核心维度。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

Motivation: 大模型预训练计算成本高昂，阻碍了快速发展。尽管已有大量预训练模型，但如何利用现有小模型加速更大模型的训练仍缺乏探索。

Method: 提出Late-to-Early Training (LET)范式，核心是通过预训练模型的后期层表示引导目标模型早期层的训练，包含后期到早期步骤学习和后期到早期层学习两种机制。

Result: 在1.4B和7B参数模型上的实验显示，LET相比标准训练实现最高1.6倍训练加速，下游任务准确率提升近5%，即使使用小10倍的预训练模型仍有效。

Conclusion: LET通过利用已有小预训练模型，显著降低大模型训练的算力成本，同时提升收敛速度和任务性能，为资源高效的模型扩展提供了有效方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法纠错(GEC)的参考评估指标(如BERTScore)因测量假设句与参考句的整体相似度，受源句中大量未变词干扰而失效；需专门针对GEC编辑行为的评估框架。

Method: 基于ERRANT编辑框架，将编辑表示为编辑向量，利用非平衡最优传输(UOT)将假设句的编辑向量传输至参考句，通过传输代价计算评估分数；提供可解释的软编辑对齐方案。

Result: 在SEEDA元评估实验中，UOT-ERRANT显著提升评估性能，尤其在+Fluency(多编辑)领域；其传输计划可解释性强，支持系统排序与GEC系统分析。

Conclusion: UOT-ERRANT为GEC评估提供了更精准、可解释的度量工具，对系统开发和调试具有重要价值；代码已开源。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems. Our code is available from https://github.com/gotutiyan/uot-errant.

Conclusion: 文化语境对VLM幻觉有显著影响，需针对性优化；所提基准和指标为多语言跨文化VLM评测提供新工具，策略发现为prompt工程提供指导。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

TL;DR: 提出CFA²框架，从因果推断视角将LLM安全机制建模为未观测混杂因子，利用前门准则和稀疏自编码器剥离防御特征实现高效越狱


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐机制作为潜在内部状态遮蔽了模型真实能力，缺乏可解释的越狱方法。传统攻击难以处理防御与任务意图的混杂关联

Method: 1. 因果建模：将安全机制视为未观测混杂因子 2. 前门调整：应用Pearl前门准则切断混杂 3. 特征剥离：用稀疏自编码器物理分离防御特征 4. 干预优化：将计算昂贵的边缘化简化为确定性干预

Result: 实现SOTA攻击成功率，同时提供越狱过程的机制性解释，推理复杂度低

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了安全机制的因果作用路径，为可解释越狱提供了新范式，同时暗示了防御设计需考虑因果解耦

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法要求架构兼容性，无法直接实现大模型到异构小模型的跨架构知识迁移，而实际应用中大量低资源场景需要小模型部署

Method: 1) 使用最优传输理论对齐异构模型的激活空间，推断跨神经元对应关系；2) 基于生成的传输计划指导权重空间的直接融合；3) 仅需少量输入样本即可完成

Result: 在低资源语言和专业化领域的广泛实验表明，该方法相比目标基线模型获得持续稳定的性能提升

Conclusion: 提出的跨架构最优传输融合方法有效解决了大模型到异构小模型的知识迁移难题，为低资源场景下的模型部署提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MT-GRPO, a multi-task adaptation of GRPO that dynamically adjusts task weights and uses a ratio-preserving sampler to improve worst-task performance and training efficiency for LLM post-training across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks, but standard GRPO and naive multi-task adaptations suffer from imbalanced optimization where some tasks dominate while others stagnate, compounded by uneven distributions of zero-advantage prompts that distort gradient signals.

Method: The authors introduce Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) with two innovations: (1) dynamic task weight adaptation that explicitly optimizes worst-task performance to ensure balanced progress, and (2) a ratio-preserving sampler that guarantees task-wise policy gradients align with the adapted weights.

Result: Experiments on 3-task and 9-task setups demonstrate MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvements in worst-task accuracy over standard GRPO and DAPO respectively, reaches 50% worst-task accuracy with 50% fewer training steps, while maintaining competitive average accuracy.

Conclusion: MT-GRPO effectively addresses multi-task imbalance and gradient distortion, providing a more efficient and reliable approach for achieving robust LLM performance across diverse real-world tasks.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLMs' homogeneous responses in education that ignore student heterogeneity and create safety risks. They propose Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and introduce CASTLE, a benchmark with 92,908 bilingual scenarios covering 15 risks and 14 student attributes, evaluated via three novel metrics. Testing 18 SOTA LLMs shows all score below 2.3/5, revealing severe deficiencies in personalized safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety evaluations rely on context-independent metrics (accuracy, bias, toxicity) that fail to capture divergent harms caused by identical responses to students with different cognitive and psychological attributes, creating safety risks for vulnerable groups in educational contexts.

Method: Propose Student-Tailored Personalized Safety concept and construct CASTLE benchmark based on educational theories. It contains 15 educational safety risks, 14 student attributes, and 92,908 bilingual scenarios. Design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity (risk detection), Emotional Empathy (student state recognition), and Student Alignment (response-attribute matching).

Result: Experiments on 18 state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate CASTLE poses significant challenge: all models scored below average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies across all three metrics.

Conclusion: The findings reveal critical gaps in personalized safety assurance among current LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for developing adaptive, student-aware safety mechanisms in educational AI applications to protect heterogeneous learner populations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示分词策略对Transformer模型处理土耳其语和希伯来语复杂动词形态系统的关键影响，语言形态透明度是决定模型表现的核心因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同分词策略如何塑造Transformer模型对形态透明的土耳其语和具有非拼接形态的希伯来语复杂动词范式的表示能力。

Method: 采用Blackbird Language Matrices任务，在自然数据上测试单语与多语模型在原子分词、子词分词、字符级分词及语素感知分词策略下的表现差异。

Result: 土耳其语因形态透明，单语和多语模型在原子或子词分词下均表现良好；希伯来语因非拼接形态，字符级分词的多语模型失败而语素感知分词的单语模型成功；所有模型在更合成的数据集上性能提升。

Conclusion: 分词策略必须与目标语言形态特征相匹配：形态透明语言对分词策略具有鲁棒性，而非拼接形态语言需要语素级分词策略才能有效建模。

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

Motivation: Existing clinical text inaccuracies (e.g., misdiagnosis) pose severe risks, yet comprehensive multilingual evaluation benchmarks for LLM-generated clinical errors are critically scarce, hindering safe and equitable AI healthcare deployment globally.

Method: Developed MedErrBench: A clinician-guided multilingual (EN/AR/ZH) benchmark based on an expanded taxonomy of 10 common clinical error types. Used natural clinical cases annotated/reviewed by domain experts. Evaluated general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain LLMs across error detection, localization, and correction tasks.

Result: Significant performance gaps were identified in non-English (Arabic/Chinese) settings compared to English across all evaluated LLMs. Current models lack robustness for multilingual clinical error handling, especially in localization and correction tasks.

Conclusion: MedErrBench exposes critical limitations in multilingual clinical NLP. Public release of the dataset and protocols aims to drive development of clinically grounded, language-aware systems essential for safer and more equitable global AI-powered healthcare.

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally.

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有MoE架构在专家粒度与硬件执行效率之间存在固有矛盾：细粒度专家提升参数效率，但导致路由复杂度爆炸和内存访问碎片化，制约实际性能。

Method: 提出系统-算法协同设计框架：(1) 向量级原子专家实现单层内可扩展路由；(2) 笛卡尔积路由器将路由复杂度从O(N)降至O(√N)；(3) 专家中心调度将分散内存查找转为稠密矩阵运算。

Result: 在1.7B活跃参数量下，七项基准测试平均零样本准确率达50.9%，优于DeepSeekMoE和PEER等基线；推理延迟从73ms降至6.7ms，实现10.9倍加速。

Conclusion: 通过打破粒度与效率的权衡，证明大规模细粒度MoE可同时实现高精度与高效率，为超大模型部署提供新范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

TL;DR: CompactRAG是一个解耦的RAG框架，通过离线LLM处理创建原子QA知识库，在线阶段仅需两次LLM调用（分解和合成）即可实现高效的多跳问答，在保持竞争力准确率的同时显著降低了token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在每一步都交替进行检索和推理，导致重复的LLM调用、高token消耗以及跨跳次的实体grounding不稳定。

Method: 提出CompactRAG框架，将离线语料库重构与在线推理解耦。离线阶段，LLM一次性读取语料库并转换为原子QA知识库；在线阶段，对复杂查询进行分解和重写以保持实体一致性，通过密集检索和RoBERTa答案提取来求解，推理过程中LLM仅被调用两次（子问题分解和最终答案合成），且与推理跳数无关。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MuSiQue上的实验表明，与迭代式RAG基线相比，CompactRAG在保持竞争力准确率的同时，显著降低了token消耗。

Conclusion: CompactRAG提供了一种针对大型知识库进行多跳推理的成本效益高且实用的方法，通过解耦离线重构与在线推理以及最小化LLM调用次数来实现。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，难以有效指导LLM在长对话理解、结构化数据分析等需严格演绎的长文本场景中的复杂推理。

Method: 提出统一框架LongR，结合动态"思考-阅读"机制（交替进行推理与文档查阅）和基于相对信息增益的上下文密度奖励（量化相关文档效用）。

Result: 在LongBench v2上提升9%，在RULER和InfiniteBench上持续改进，对DAPO、GSPO等多种强化学习算法均有效，且在长文本导航中表现稳健。

Conclusion: LongR通过细粒度奖励信号和推理-查阅交互机制显著提升长文本推理能力，并验证了推理链长度效率与抗干扰鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLM助手的普及，学术界对其滥用表示担忧，特别是难以区分人类撰写和AI生成的文本。先前研究表明自动化检测器常因困惑度特征而错误地将非母语者文章标记为AI生成，但该结论是否适用于当代检测器及非英语语言（特别是捷克语）尚不明确。

Method: 研究者在两年后重新验证先前结论，聚焦捷克语语境。通过分析捷克母语者与非母语者的文本困惑度差异，并测试三种不同家族的检测器，评估其对非母语者是否存在系统性偏见。

Result: 捷克非母语者的文本困惑度并不低于母语者；三种检测器家族均未发现针对非母语者的系统性偏见；当代检测器无需依赖困惑度特征即可有效运行。

Conclusion: 先前关于困惑度导致的检测偏见结论在当代捷克语语境下不成立，现代AI文本检测器对非母语者具有公平性，且技术已发展至不再依赖困惑度作为核心特征。

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that trains LLM-based agents to learn action-conditioned world models by aligning simulated and real next states in a pre-trained embedding space, significantly outperforming RL baselines and matching expert training on ALFWorld and τ² Bench without using human demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in agentic settings to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, indicating a deficiency in world-modeling capabilities that is critical for effective agent decision-making.

Method: Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML) uses sim-to-real gap rewards to align simulated next states from the world model with actual environment states in a pre-trained embedding space, prioritizing semantic consistency over token-level fidelity to avoid model collapse and reward hacking.

Result: On ALFWorld and τ² Bench, RWML combined with task-success rewards outperforms direct task-success RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points respectively while matching expert-data training performance, using only self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: RWML provides a robust, self-supervised framework for learning world models in LLM-based agents, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap and achieving expert-level performance without demonstrations, demonstrating the viability of embedding-space rewards over token prediction for agent training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose OdysseyArena, a novel evaluation framework for LLM-based autonomous agents that emphasizes long-horizon, inductive discovery of latent rules, exposing performance deficiencies in frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent evaluations use deductive paradigms (explicit rules, static goals, short horizons) but fail to assess inductive reasoning—discovering latent transition laws from experience—which is essential for agentic foresight and strategic coherence.

Method: Formalize four primitives to instantiate interactive environments, creating OdysseyArena-Lite (120 benchmark tasks) for standardized evaluation of inductive efficiency and OdysseyArena-Challenge for stress-testing stability over extreme horizons (>200 steps).

Result: Evaluating 15+ leading LLMs reveals that even frontier models exhibit significant inductive deficiencies, identifying a critical bottleneck in autonomous discovery within complex environments.

Conclusion: Current LLM agents lack robust inductive reasoning capabilities for long-horizon autonomous discovery, and OdysseyArena provides a necessary framework to measure and address this fundamental limitation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

*Siran Liu,Guoxia Wang,Sa Wang,Jinle Zeng,HaoYang Xie,Siyu Lou,JiaBin Yang,DianHai Yu,Haifeng Wang,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RRAttention is a dynamic sparse attention method that uses head round-robin sampling to reduce quadratic complexity while maintaining query independence and global pattern discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms severely limits long-context processing in LLMs. Existing dynamic sparse attention methods suffer from fundamental trade-offs including preprocessing requirements, lack of global evaluation, violation of query independence, or high computational overhead.

Method: RRAttention employs a head round-robin sampling strategy that rotates query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride. This maintains query independence while enabling stride-level aggregation for global pattern discovery. The method reduces complexity from O(L²) to O(L²/S²) and uses adaptive Top-τ selection for optimal sparsity.

Result: Extensive experiments on HELMET and Video-MME benchmarks show RRAttention recovers over 99% of full attention performance while computing only half the attention blocks, achieving 2.4× speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

Conclusion: RRAttention successfully achieves all desirable properties for dynamic sparse attention—query independence, global evaluation, efficiency, and no preprocessing overhead—making it a practical solution for long-context LLM processing.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

*Adrián Girón,Pablo Miralles,Javier Huertas-Tato,Sergio D'Antonio,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that breaks down hate speech detection into concept-level questions answered by LLMs and aggregated via decision trees, improving cross-dataset robustness and interpretability over traditional binary classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech is a composite concept with multiple interacting factors varying across legal frameworks and policies, but current supervised models treat it as simple binary classification, causing overfitting to dataset-specific definitions and poor robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.

Method: Introduces xList-Hate, which decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit concept-level questions based on shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model, producing binary diagnostic signals that are aggregated by a lightweight, interpretable decision tree to generate transparent predictions.

Result: The framework consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift compared to zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. It shows less sensitivity to annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity, while providing fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.

Conclusion: Reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task rather than monolithic classification provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FaithRL: A step-level reinforcement learning method that uses faithfulness rewards and truncated resampling to reduce hallucinations in small reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small reasoning models (SRMs) enable efficient chain-of-thought reasoning but suffer from faithfulness hallucinations in intermediate steps. Existing online RL methods using outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained evaluation can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when final answers are correct, creating a supervision gap at the step level.

Method: Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL) introduces dual supervision: (1) explicit step-level faithfulness rewards from a process reward model that evaluates intermediate reasoning steps, and (2) an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive learning signals by resampling from faithful reasoning prefixes to create positive/negative step-level examples.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrates that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates in both chain-of-thought traces and final answers, improving reasoning faithfulness without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The method establishes that fine-grained, step-level faithfulness supervision is critical for reliable reasoning in resource-constrained models, providing a scalable framework for training more trustworthy small reasoning systems.

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出KV-CoRE，一种基于SVD的KV-cache可压缩性评估方法，通过无梯度、增量式计算揭示不同模型、数据域和语言下的系统性压缩规律，为动态数据感知压缩提供首个大规模基准和分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的KV-cache在长上下文下会饱和GPU内存带宽，现有压缩方法忽略了KV-cache的数据依赖性和层间差异性，缺乏对可压缩性的量化评估。

Method: KV-CoRE（KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation）：采用奇异值分解（SVD）在Frobenius范数下计算最优低秩近似；无梯度、增量式的特性支持高效的数据集级和层间评估；提出归一化有效秩（Normalized Effective Rank）作为可压缩性度量指标。

Result: 在五个英文域和十六种语言的多个模型与数据集上分析发现：KV-cache可压缩性与模型架构、训练数据和语言覆盖存在系统性关联；归一化有效秩与压缩下的性能退化呈强相关性。

Conclusion: 建立了原则性的评估框架和首个大规模KV-cache可压缩性基准，为开发动态数据感知压缩策略和数据为中心的模型设计提供了关键洞见。

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

### [48] [Polyglots or Multitudes? Multilingual LLM Answers to Value-laden Multiple-Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05932)
*Léo Labat,Etienne Ollion,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether multilingual LLMs exhibit consistent value judgments across languages or show language-specific variations. Using a novel human-translated corpus of European value surveys, the study finds that while larger instruction-tuned models are more consistent, language-specific behaviors emerge on certain questions, suggesting selective effects of preference fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multilingualism's effect on LLM factual recall has been studied, there's limited understanding of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. The key question is whether multilingual LLMs behave like consistent polyglots or show language-dependent value judgments.

Method: The researchers created the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS) corpus with human-translated survey questions in 8 European languages. They administered these to 30+ multilingual LLMs under controlled prompt variations (answer order, symbol type, tail character) to test response consistency.

Result: Larger instruction-tuned models show higher overall consistency, but robustness varies significantly across questions—some MCQs elicit uniform responses while others produce splits. Language-specific behaviors appear in consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models but only on certain questions.

Conclusion: The findings reveal selective language-specific value judgments in multilingual LLMs, warranting further investigation into how preference fine-tuning affects cross-lingual value alignment.

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

TL;DR: TRIT is a self-improving framework that integrates translation training with multilingual reasoning to solve long reasoning models' tendency to default to English or lose accuracy in non-English languages, achieving significant improvements on multilingual math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long reasoning models exhibit poor multilingual performance, defaulting to English reasoning for non-English queries or suffering substantial accuracy drops when constrained to the question language, due to insufficient multilingual question understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Method: TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training) - a self-improving framework that jointly trains translation and reasoning without external feedback or additional multilingual data, enhancing both question understanding and response generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 7pp on MMATH, improves cross-lingual alignment by 10pp+, enhances translation quality with up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200, improving both answer correctness and language consistency.

Conclusion: Integrating translation training effectively addresses multilingual reasoning limitations, significantly improving cross-lingual alignment and translation quality while boosting reasoning performance without requiring external resources.

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that models semantic representation as navigation trajectories through transformer-based embedding space, extracting geometric and dynamical metrics (distance, entropy, velocity, acceleration) to distinguish clinical groups and concept types across four multilingual datasets with minimal human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computationally grounded method for investigating how humans navigate semantic space, moving beyond labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing to bridge cognitive modeling with learned representations.

Method: Constructs participant-specific cumulative embedding trajectories using transformer models, extracting geometric (distance to next/centroid, entropy) and dynamical (velocity, acceleration) metrics across four diverse datasets (neurodegenerative, swear fluency, Italian/German property listing).

Result: The approach successfully distinguishes clinical groups and concept types; cumulative embeddings outperform non-cumulative for longer trajectories; different embedding models produce convergent results; framework requires minimal manual preprocessing.

Conclusion: This trajectory-based framework provides a robust, mathematically grounded pipeline for quantifying semantic dynamics, with applications in clinical assessment, cross-linguistic research, and evaluation of artificial cognition systems.

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

Motivation: 现有固定块调度策略对语义难度不敏感，在困难位置被迫过早决策，同时延迟简单位置的生成，造成生成质量和推理效率的双重损失。

Method: 提出动态滑动块(DSB)调度方法，采用可变大小的滑动块以适应语义难度；同时设计DSB Cache专用KV缓存机制进一步提升效率。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSB与DSB Cache的组合在生成质量和推理效率上均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 动态适配语义难度的块调度对可靠高效推理至关重要，所提的无训练DSB和DSB Cache方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

Conclusion: 情境知识选择和建模策略对大模型心理健康评估准确性至关重要，需谨慎设计以提升临床部署效果

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

Conclusion: BudgetMem提供了查询感知的运行时记忆管理新范式，通过显式预算控制实现了性能与成本的有效平衡，为不同应用场景提供了灵活的记忆策略选择。

Abstract: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

### [55] [Denoising diffusion networks for normative modeling in neuroimaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04886)
*Luke Whitbread,Lyle J. Palmer,Mark Jenkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for neuroimaging-derived phenotypes, using either FiLM-MLP or SAINT transformer backbones. The method captures multivariate dependence while maintaining per-IDP calibration, with the transformer showing superior high-dimensional performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neuroimaging pipelines model each imaging-derived phenotype (IDP) independently, discarding multivariate dependence that encodes coordinated biological patterns. The authors aim to develop a unified normative modeling approach that preserves these dependencies while remaining compatible with standard per-IDP analysis frameworks.

Method: The method employs DDPMs for conditional density estimation of tabular IDPs. Two denoiser architectures are evaluated: (1) feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned MLP, and (2) SAINT tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention. Conditioning covariates are incorporated through learned embeddings. Comprehensive evaluation includes synthetic benchmarks and UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes (dimensions 2-200), assessing centile calibration, distributional fidelity, multivariate dependence, and memorization.

Result: In low dimensions, DDPMs achieve per-IDP calibration comparable to traditional baselines while successfully modeling realistic multivariate dependence. In high dimensions (up to 200), the SAINT transformer backbone demonstrates substantially better calibration than the MLP backbone and superior preservation of higher-order dependence structures. The approach enables scalable joint normative models compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based normative modeling provides a practical route to generating calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging, effectively bridging the gap between scalable univariate modeling and capturing biologically meaningful multivariate patterns.

Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Causal Analyst框架，通过因果发现从37个可解释提示特征中识别LLM越狱的直接原因（如"积极角色"和"任务步数"），并基于因果路径构建越狱增强器和防御护栏，实现攻防两用。

Motivation: 现有越狱研究多分析潜在表征，忽视了可解释提示特征与越狱结果间的因果关系，导致越狱机制理解不足，影响LLM安全性提升。

Method: 构建7个LLM上3.5万次越狱尝试的数据集，标注37个人工可读特征；联合训练LLM提示编码器与GNN因果图学习模块，重建特征到越狱响应的因果路径。

Result: 发现"积极角色"和"任务步数"等特征是越狱的直接因果驱动因素；开发的越狱增强器显著提升攻击成功率，护栏顾问能从混淆查询中提取恶意意图，性能优于非因果方法。

Conclusion: 从因果视角分析越狱特征是提升LLM可靠性的一种有效且可解释的方法，揭示了可操作的攻防机制。

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

*Eitan Sprejer,Oscar Agustín Stanchi,María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Iván Arcuschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 特征引导能有效控制LLM行为，但会严重损害模型性能（准确率下降20-14个百分点），由于能力-行为权衡更优，简单提示工程在实际应用中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的动机是探究特征引导方法在控制LLM行为时的实际有效性与输出质量权衡，因为该方法虽前景广阔，但其现实影响尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 研究人员在Llama-8B和Llama-70B模型上，针对14项引导任务和171道MMLU问题，对比评估了Goodfire的Auto Steer方法与提示工程基线，测量指标包括准确率、连贯性和行为控制效果。

Result: Auto Steer成功修改了目标行为（Llama-8B上得分3.33 vs 2.98；Llama-70B上3.57 vs 3.10），但导致性能急剧下降：MMLU准确率从Llama-8B的66%降至46%，Llama-70B从87%降至73%；连贯性分别从4.62降至2.24和从4.94降至3.89。简单提示工程实现了最佳综合平衡。

Conclusion: 当前特征引导方法面临根本性的能力-行为权衡限制，由于任务性能不可牺牲，这些方法难以实际部署；更广泛地说，机制性控制方法在部署前必须经过实证表征。

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

TL;DR: DCER通过双阶段压缩和基于能量的重建解决多模态融合中的噪声输入和缺失模态问题，实现SOTA性能并提供强不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合面临两个鲁棒性挑战：噪声输入导致表示质量下降，缺失模态引发预测失败。

Method: 提出的DCER框架包含：(1) 模态内频域变换(小波/DCT)去噪；(2) 跨模态瓶颈token强制真实融合；(3) 基于能量的重建通过梯度下降恢复缺失模态表示并提供不确定性量化。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS基准测试上实现SOTA性能，呈现U形鲁棒性模式(在完整和高缺失条件下均有效)，且不确定性量化与预测误差相关性ρ>0.72。

Conclusion: DCER为多模态融合鲁棒性挑战提供了统一解决方案，能有效处理噪声和缺失数据，同时提供可解释的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

Motivation: To adapt Laplacian-based time-series models during inference using only an observed prefix, addressing challenges of changing dynamics.

Method: Combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to create diffusion-coordinate representations, with lightweight latent-space residual adapters (Gaussian-process regression or attention-like Markov operator) and a frozen nonlinear decoder.

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows.

### [60] [Physics as the Inductive Bias for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04907)
*Jianhong Chen,Naichen Shi,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that combines partial physical knowledge (ODEs) with data-driven learning using stochastic differential equations, achieving improved causal graph recovery while handling feedback loops and non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods struggle with real dynamical systems due to feedback loops, cyclic interactions, and non-stationarity—they often assume acyclicity or equilibrium. Integrating physics-based models with data-driven approaches could improve identifiability, stability, and robustness, but remains challenging.

Method: The authors model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term captures unknown causal couplings. They develop a sparsity-inducing maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for scalable parameter estimation.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides guarantees for causal graph recovery under mild conditions. Empirical experiments on diverse dynamical systems demonstrate that the approach outperforms purely data-driven baselines in causal graph recovery while producing more stable and physically consistent estimates.

Conclusion: Integrating partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias in causal discovery for dynamical systems is feasible and effective, offering better performance, stability, and physical consistency compared to purely data-driven methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

### [61] [Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04908)
*Chika Maduabuchi,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对连续时间生成模型训练中时间步独立处理导致的高方差与低效采样问题，提出一种轻量级方差缩减框架——时间对一致性(TPC)。该方法通过耦合概率路径上配对时间步的速度预测，在不改动模型架构、概率路径或求解器的前提下，理论可证明其引入二次轨迹耦合正则化以降低梯度方差，并在CIFAR-10、ImageNet等基准上实现样本质量与计算效率的同步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间生成模型(如扩散模型、flow matching、rectified flow)虽然学习时间相关向量场，但其训练目标常将各时间步视为独立，造成估计器方差高、采样效率低下。传统缓解策略依赖显式平滑惩罚、轨迹正则化或重构概率路径与求解器，往往引入额外计算负担或设计复杂度。

Method: TPC作为一种估计器层面的方差缩减原则，核心思想是将同一概率路径上配对时间步的velocity预测进行耦合。该方法无需修改模型结构、概率路径或ODE求解器，通过理论分析表明其自动诱导出二次轨迹耦合正则化效应，在保持原始flow matching目标函数不变的同时有效降低梯度估计方差。

Result: 实验验证TPC在CIFAR-10与ImageNet多分辨率数据集上均能提升生成样本质量与采样效率，以更低的计算成本获得更优的FID指标。此外，该方法兼容现代SOTA训练范式，包括噪声增强、基于分数的去噪以及rectified flow框架。

Conclusion: TPC为连续时间生成模型提供了一种简洁而有效的方差控制机制，在算法轻量化与性能提升之间取得良好平衡，展现出良好的扩展性与实用价值。

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

TL;DR: GAPO用动态几何锚点替代DPO的固定参考策略，通过对抗性局部扰动构建悲观基线，基于锚点差距自适应重加权偏好对，显著提升噪声环境下的鲁棒性且不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO等偏好对齐方法因固定参考策略在策略漂移时产生分布失配，放大噪声信号；无参考变体虽避免失配但面临无约束奖励漂移，亟需平衡两者。

Method: 构建几何锚点——对当前策略施加微小半径内的对抗性扰动作为动态悲观基线，定义锚点差距（策略与锚点的奖励差异）作为局部鲁棒性度量，设计自适应重加权机制优化加权逻辑目标函数。

Result: 在多样化噪声设置下，GAPO持续增强模型鲁棒性，同时在标准LLM对齐和推理基准测试中达到或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 该动态几何锚定框架有效调和了参考策略的稳定性与适应性矛盾，为噪声偏好监督下的LLM对齐提供了理论保证和实践优势。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

*E Bowen,R Granger,A Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph-based system with low-precision arithmetic and a graph-Hamiltonian operator intrinsically encodes relations (e.g., part-whole) as primitive pairwise edges, enabling symbolic-like computation, hierarchical relational structures, and abductive inference with linear computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ANNs struggle with intrinsic relational representation. This work aims to create an architecture fundamentally distinct from ANNs that can intrinsically encode relations (like part-whole) while bridging neural and symbolic computation, using radically low-precision arithmetic for efficiency.

Method: Encodes arbitrary data as graphs with edges from a small fixed set of primitive pairwise relations. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states satisfying all relation constraints. Uses low-precision arithmetic and scales linearly with edge count.

Result: The system processes standard ANN examples while producing symbolic-like representations. It identifies logical relational structures (part-of, next-to), builds hierarchical representations enabling abductive inference, and derives an equivalent set of ANN operations revealing a special case of embedded vector encodings.

Conclusion: The simple preliminary system successfully demonstrates intrinsic relational encoding with symbolic computation characteristics. Its current state invites additional tools and improvements, suggesting a promising approach for higher-level semantic representation beyond statistical methods.

Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar LLM that jointly generates language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework, achieving superior emotional expressiveness with real-time performance (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cascaded conversational avatar systems suffer from accumulated errors, high latency, poor real-time performance, and lack emotional depth due to independent modules lacking shared conversational context.

Method: We introduce A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion. To support training, we create FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset aligning semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics in QA format.

Result: The system achieves superior emotional expressiveness beyond simple lip-synchronization while maintaining real-time efficiency with 500 ms latency and 0.7 RTF.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that unified end-to-end reasoning enables more expressive and responsive conversational digital humans, overcoming key limitations of traditional pipeline architectures.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

TL;DR: 提出SLAY，一种基于球面Yat核的线性时间注意力机制，能在O(L)复杂度下近乎完美地逼近标准softmax注意力性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer中softmax注意力的O(L²)计算瓶颈问题，开发一种不牺牲性能的线性时间注意力机制。

Method: 将查询和键约束到单位球面，利用Bernstein定理将球面值Yat核表示为多项式-指数乘积核的非负混合，推导严格正随机特征近似以实现O(L)注意力。

Result: 性能与标准softmax注意力几乎无法区分，保持线性时间/内存缩放，持续优于Performers和Cosformers等先前线性时间注意力机制。

Conclusion: SLAY代表了迄今为止最接近softmax注意力的线性时间近似，无需典型的性能权衡即可实现可扩展的Transformer。

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

### [66] [Multi-Aspect Mining and Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Tensor Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04917)
*Soshi Kakio,Yasuko Matsubara,Ren Fujiwara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes HeteroComp for heterogeneous tensor stream analysis and group anomaly detection, using Gaussian process priors to handle mixed attribute types and temporal dynamics without discretization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods cannot handle heterogeneous tensors (categorical + continuous attributes) without distorting statistical properties through discretization, and fail to detect group-level anomalies due to timestamp discretization that loses temporal dynamics.

Method: HeteroComp employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes and temporal dynamics directly from data, continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into components representing latent attribute groups and their temporal patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate superior group anomaly detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, with computational time independent of data stream length.

Conclusion: HeteroComp provides an effective discretization-free solution for heterogeneous tensor stream analysis, offering accurate group anomaly detection and computational efficiency by directly modeling data distributions and temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

TL;DR: 提出Prune-Tune Loop (PTL)渐进压缩方法，通过多轮剪枝-微调循环将大语言模型压缩至近半尺寸，仅需轻量后训练即可保持推理性能，适用于多种剪枝策略和任务。

Conclusion: PTL是灵活高效的LLM压缩范式，显著降低计算成本的同时保持性能，具有广泛的适用性和实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Conclusion: CyIN有效弥合了完整与不完整多模态学习的鸿沟，通过信息纯化与循环翻译机制显著提升模型在真实复杂场景中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

*Sepehr Mousavi,Siddhartha Mishra,Laura De Lorenzis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a general framework for neural operators to handle complex boundary conditions by mapping boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions across the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to incorporate boundary information. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across 18 challenging PDE datasets without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators are powerful surrogates for PDE solutions but struggle with general, highly variable boundary conditions. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator is highly sensitive to boundary forcings, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The authors propose mapping boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain. This allows any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The approach couples this extension mechanism with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator to learn dependencies on both complex boundary conditions and input domain functions simultaneously.

Result: The paper constructs 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment boundary conditions on diverse geometries. Their approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across different datasets.

Conclusion: Learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex boundary conditions in neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

TL;DR: STIR是一个动态隐轨迹控制框架，通过将思维链内化到隐藏状态来提升推理效率。相比静态控制向量，它采用三阶段流程：蒸馏成功推理轨迹生成控制基元、构建稀疏控制基、基于价值调制的动态干预，在六个算术逻辑基准测试中准确率提升1.9-7.5%，同时减少高达35%的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活 steering 方法依赖静态控制向量，无法适应复杂推理任务的非稳态演化特性，限制了通过内化推理过程来扩展测试时计算效率的潜力。需要在隐藏状态空间中实现动态、自适应的推理轨迹控制。

Method: STIR将推理增强重新表述为动态隐轨迹控制问题，采用协同三阶段流水线：(1) 差分内在动作诱导——从成功推理中提取隐式控制基元；(2) 稀疏控制基构建——精选几何多样化的紧凑工具库；(3) 价值调制轨迹干预——通过锚点门控动态注入上下文特定的控制脉冲。

Result: 在四个代表性模型上的六个算术和逻辑基准测试表明，STIR相比原生解码平均准确率提升1.9%至7.5%，同时平均token消耗减少高达35%，实现了在降低计算成本的同时提升推理性能。

Conclusion: 动态隐轨迹控制能够有效内化推理过程，绕过显式思维链生成的同时实现更高的保真度，证明显式推理的益处可通过隐空间操控实现，为测试时计算扩展提供了高效的新范式。

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Euphonium, a flow matching framework that uses process reward gradient guidance via SDE formulation for efficient exploration in online RL, with distillation to remove reward model dependency at inference. Achieves better alignment and 1.66x faster convergence in text-to-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online RL methods for aligning flow matching models suffer from inefficient exploration due to reliance on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, resulting in data inefficiency and slow optimization. There's a need for more directed exploration mechanisms.

Method: Introduces Euphonium framework that: 1) Formulates sampling as SDE with process reward gradients in flow drift for dense step-by-step guidance; 2) Derives distillation objective to internalize guidance; 3) Implements Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization combining latent process rewards for credit assignment and pixel-level outcome rewards for visual fidelity.

Result: On text-to-video generation, Euphonium achieves superior alignment with human preferences and accelerates training convergence by 1.66x compared to existing methods, while theoretically generalizing approaches like Flow-GRPO and DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses exploration inefficiency in flow matching alignment through principled gradient-guided dynamics and distillation, demonstrating significant improvements in both performance and training efficiency for generative tasks.

Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TurboBoA is a backpropagation-free post-training quantization algorithm that accelerates BoA by over 3x through joint out-channel quantization, error propagation correction, and adaptive grid refinement, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in low-bit LLM quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models' rapid growth necessitates efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce memory/computation costs. GPTQ's layer-wise independence assumption causes accuracy degradation in low-bit regimes, while BoA's inter-layer dependency modeling improves accuracy but suffers from sequential quantization inefficiency.

Method: The paper proposes TurboBoA with three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels using a closed-form error compensation rule to eliminate sequential bottlenecks; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates.

Result: TurboBoA achieves >3× speedup over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression, it attains state-of-the-art performance in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization scenarios.

Conclusion: TurboBoA successfully preserves BoA's accuracy advantages while significantly accelerating the quantization process, establishing a new efficient PTQ baseline for resource-constrained LLM deployment.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Motivation: Understanding how large language models internally transform contextual information into token predictions through representational geometry and mechanistic structure.

Method: Unified framework combining geometric analysis of representation space with mechanistic intervention to study computation phases across model depth.

Result: Identified depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases; discovered that angular organization of late-layer representations parametizes prediction distributional similarity for causal control, while representation norms encode context-specific information that doesn't determine predictions.

Conclusion: Provides a mechanistic-geometric account revealing how LLMs dynamically transform context into predictions through structured representational geometry and layer-wise computational reorganization.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

TL;DR: HC-GCD performs hyperbolic clustering directly in hyperbolic space, matching SOTA while improving clustering consistency and accuracy over Euclidean methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior hyperbolic GCD methods use hyperbolic geometry only for representation learning but revert to Euclidean space for clustering, which the authors hypothesize is suboptimal for hierarchical structure extraction.

Method: Proposes Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD) that learns embeddings in Lorentz Hyperboloid model and clusters them directly using hyperbolic K-Means, eliminating the Euclidean transformation step.

Result: On par with previous SOTA on Semantic Shift Benchmark; hyperbolic K-Means outperforms Euclidean K-Means in accuracy. Ablation shows norm clipping harms unseen class clustering but helps seen classes, with dataset-dependent overall effects. Hyperbolic K-Means yields more consistent clusters across label granularities.

Conclusion: Direct hyperbolic space clustering validates the hypothesis and provides superior performance and cluster consistency for Generalized Category Discovery tasks.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

TL;DR: Proposes model merging as an efficient proxy for data mixture optimization in multimodal LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating high rank correlation between merged and actual trained models across 14 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data mixture optimization for multimodal LLM SFT suffers from combinatorial search complexity and prohibitive training costs; model merging offers efficiency but historically yields suboptimal performance.

Method: Train domain-specific multimodal experts, then perform weighted parameter-space interpolation (model merging) to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures without full retraining.

Result: Merged proxy models exhibit high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures across 14 multimodal benchmarks, validating the estimation approach.

Conclusion: Model merging decouples mixture search from resource-intensive training, providing a scalable, efficient strategy for navigating complex data mixture optimization landscapes.

Abstract: Selecting the best data mixture is critical for successful Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

*Emiliano Penaloza,Dheeraj Vattikonda,Nicolas Gontier,Alexandre Lacoste,Laurent Charlin,Massimo Caccia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of transferring capabilities learned with training-time privileged information (PI) to inference-time policies that lack PI access, specifically in distilling frontier models where only action trajectories are observable. It introduces π-Distill (joint teacher-student training) and OPSD (RL with reverse KL-penalty), demonstrating they outperform standard supervised finetuning+RL approaches that assume full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models benefit from training with privileged information but struggle to transfer these capabilities to deployment-time policies without PI access. Standard distillation fails when distilling closed-source frontier agents because only action trajectories are exposed—not the internal reasoning process—breaking conventional teacher-student pipelines that require reasoning supervision.

Method: The paper proposes two algorithms: (1) π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that simultaneously trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student using the same model parameters, enabling direct capability transfer without reasoning traces; (2) On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an RL-based approach that optimizes the student with a reverse KL-divergence penalty relative to the PI-conditioned teacher.

Result: Both π-Distill and OPSD effectively distill frontier agents using only action-level privileged information. Empirically, π-Distill and sometimes OPSD outperform industry-standard practices of supervised finetuning followed by RL that assume access to complete Chain-of-Thought supervision, across multiple agentic benchmarks, model architectures, and forms of PI.

Conclusion: The methods successfully address PI transfer in distillation scenarios where reasoning traces are unavailable. π-Distill emerges as the more consistently effective approach, while OPSD can be competitive under specific conditions. The analysis provides characterization of key factors enabling effective learning with privileged information, advancing distillation techniques for black-box frontier models.

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

Motivation: Physical model calibration faces challenges from highly anisotropic parameter landscapes, computational expense of exhaustive sampling, and parameter uncertainties—particularly in domains like plasma-surface interactions where kinetic simulations are costly and surface reactivity parameters are poorly constrained.

Method: Sloppy Model theory-inspired stochastic hierarchical optimization using reduced Hessian approximation to identify stiff parameter subspace with minimal simulation queries, integrated with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data.

Result: Comparative analysis demonstrates consistent superiority over baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency, successfully applied to plasma-surface interaction modeling with reduced computational burden.

Conclusion: This framework provides a generalizable and scalable approach for optimizing complex reaction systems across domains such as plasma chemistry and biochemical networks, effectively addressing anisotropy and computational constraints.

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

TL;DR: Develops coarsening-based online matching algorithms that aggregate offline nodes into capacitated clusters to achieve near-optimal theoretical guarantees, successfully applied to heart transplant allocation with performance matching omniscient benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical online matching algorithms (e.g., in organ allocation) often lack strong theoretical guarantees, creating a gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds.

Method: Introduces a coarsening approach that aggregates offline nodes into capacitated clusters, leveraging structural properties of historical data to design theoretically grounded allocation policies.

Result: In realistic heart transplant simulations, the algorithm achieves near-optimal performance closely matching the omniscient benchmark, validating prior clustering-based heuristics with rigorous guarantees.

Conclusion: Bridges the theory-practice gap by providing the first rigorous justification for clustering in organ allocation, transforming heuristic approaches into provably effective policies.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

### [83] [Learning Rate Matters: Vanilla LoRA May Suffice for LLM Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04998)
*Yu-Ang Lee,Ching-Yun Ko,Pin-Yu Chen,Mi-Yen Yeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically re-evaluates LoRA variants through extensive hyperparameter tuning, finding that when learning rates are properly optimized, all methods achieve similar peak performance, challenging claims of consistent superiority of modified LoRA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent LoRA variants report substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA, but these claims rely on fixed/narrowly-tuned hyperparameters. The paper questions whether reported gains reflect genuine methodological advantages or artifacts of suboptimal training configurations, given neural networks' known sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Method: Conducted systematic hyperparameter searches (particularly learning rates) to compare four representative LoRA variants against vanilla LoRA across mathematical/code generation tasks on diverse model scales. Performed second-order analysis using Hessian eigenvalues to understand underlying mechanisms.

Result: Different LoRA variants favor distinct optimal learning rate ranges. When properly tuned, all methods achieve nearly identical peak performance (within 1-2%). Only subtle rank-dependent behaviors observed. The varying optimal learning rates correlate with differences in largest Hessian eigenvalue, consistent with classical learning theory.

Conclusion: Vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline. Improvements reported under single configurations may not indicate consistent methodological advantages. Hyperparameter sensitivity, especially to learning rates, is critical for fair evaluation of efficient fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

*Atula Tejaswi,Litu Rout,Constantine Caramanis,Sanjay Shakkottai,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EntRGi, an entropy-aware reward guidance method for discrete diffusion language models that dynamically regulates reward gradients using model confidence to overcome limitations of existing continuous relaxation and straight-through estimator approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward guidance works well for continuous diffusion models but fails for discrete language models due to non-differentiable token outputs; existing methods either degrade gradient feedback (continuous relaxation) or cause incorrect optimization (straight-through estimator), creating a fundamental tradeoff that needs resolution.

Method: Entropy-aware Reward Guidance (EntRGi) that dynamically modulates continuous relaxation based on the model's confidence (entropy) to regulate reward gradients, providing more reliable inputs to the reward model while improving optimization correctness.

Result: Empirical validation on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks demonstrated consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EntRGi effectively bridges the gap between discrete token outputs and differentiable reward optimization by adaptively controlling gradient flow based on model uncertainty, substantially enhancing reward guidance performance for discrete diffusion language models.

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Proposes an Lp-norm generalization of QKNorm for Transformer query/key vector normalization, enabling non-Euclidean metrics and demonstrating feasibility on a simple problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard query/key normalization in Transformers relies on Euclidean norms; a generalized Lp-norm approach could provide greater flexibility and improved stability for learning with varying vector scales.

Method: Generalizes QKNorm by replacing the Euclidean norm with a parameterized Lp norm, allowing non-Euclidean distance metrics to be incorporated into the normalization scheme.

Result: Experimental validation on a simple problem confirms the method's suitability and practical feasibility.

Conclusion: This preliminary work establishes that Lp-norm-based QKNorm is a viable extension for Transformer architectures, warranting further investigation on complex tasks.

Abstract: The normalization of query and key vectors is an essential part of the Transformer architecture. It ensures that learning is stable regardless of the scale of these vectors. Some normalization approaches are available. In this preliminary work, a generalization of the QKNorm normalization scheme is proposed. The approach is based on the Lp norm, allowing non-Euclidean norms to be employed. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the method for a simple problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习(ICL)使大语言模型无需微调即可适应新任务，但示例可能含隐私敏感信息；现有差分隐私ICL方法计算昂贵或依赖启发式策略且效果有限

Method: 从专家乘积模型视角重新构建私有ICL，获得理论依据充分的框架，算法可简单并行化

Result: 在五个文本分类、数学和视觉语言数据集上，准确率相比先前DP-ICL方法平均提升超过30个百分点

Conclusion: 该方法在保持强隐私保证的同时，显著提升了私有上下文学习的性能与实用性

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

### [87] [A Simple Reduction Scheme for Constrained Contextual Bandits with Adversarial Contexts via Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05019)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Abhishek Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a modular algorithmic scheme for constrained contextual bandits with adversarial contexts, reducing the problem to unconstrained bandits via surrogate rewards and online regression oracles, achieving improved guarantees over prior stochastic-context approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CCB research focuses on stochastic contexts, but real-world scenarios often feature adversarial contexts. The continuing setting where algorithms operate post-budget exhaustion requires simultaneous regret and constraint violation control, which existing methods don't adequately address for adversarial cases.

Method: Builds on SquareCB framework, uses online regression oracles to predict reward/cost functions, constructs adaptively defined surrogate reward functions to transform the constrained optimization into an unconstrained contextual bandit problem.

Result: Achieves improved theoretical guarantees for adversarial contexts compared to prior work, with a simpler, more transparent analysis and modular algorithm design.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme provides a principled approach to handling adversarial contexts in CCB with budget constraints, offering both theoretical improvements and practical simplicity through reduction to standard bandit problems.

Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.

Conclusion: 基于熵的学习动力学框架为对抗鲁棒性提供新理论视角，终身集成策略能有效防御迁移对抗攻击，对构建安全AI系统具有重要意义

Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

### [89] [Laplacian Representations for Decision-Time Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05031)
*Dikshant Shehmar,Matthew Schlegel,Matthew E. Taylor,Marlos C. Machado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm that leverages the Laplacian representation's multi-scale distance preservation to decompose long-horizon tasks and mitigate compounding errors, achieving model-free comparable performance on OGBench goal-conditioned RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based RL struggles with planning using learned models due to compounding errors in long-horizon predictions. State representations must simultaneously support local cost computation and preserve global structure, yet most learned representations fail to maintain meaningful distances across multiple time scales, limiting their effectiveness for decision-time planning.

Method: Introduces the Laplacian representation as a latent space that captures state-space distances across multiple time scales. This representation naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals while preserving metric structure. Building on these properties, the authors develop ALPS (Adaptive Laplacian Planning System), a hierarchical planning algorithm that operates in this learned representation space.

Result: ALPS outperforms commonly used model-based baselines on offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from the OGBench benchmark. The approach demonstrates that model-based methods can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art model-free methods on this benchmark, which was previously dominated by model-free approaches.

Conclusion: The Laplacian representation provides an effective inductive bias for planning by maintaining meaningful distances across time scales while enabling automatic subgoal decomposition. This work establishes that carefully designed state representations can mitigate compounding errors in model-based RL, opening new possibilities for hierarchical planning in learned latent spaces.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

*Karish Grover,Theodore Vasiloudis,Han Xie,Sixing Lu,Xiang Song,Christos Faloutsos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ControlG is a control-theoretic framework that reformulates multi-objective graph self-supervised learning as a temporal allocation problem, using PID controllers and Pareto-aware planning to dynamically schedule optimization budgets for different pretext tasks, outperforming existing methods on 9 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph SSL pipelines combining multiple pretext objectives (mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning) suffer from objective interference and training instability. Current per-update mixing approaches force every parameter update to compromise between conflicting objectives, causing three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). The core insight is that coordination should be treated as temporal allocation rather than static weighting.

Method: ControlG recasts multi-objective graph SSL as a feedback-controlled temporal allocation problem. It estimates per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, plans target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and schedules optimization using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers that dynamically adjust when each objective receives optimization budget based on performance feedback.

Result: Evaluated across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while generating auditable schedules that reveal which objectives drove learning, demonstrating both performance gains and interpretability.

Conclusion: The work establishes that treating multi-objective coordination as temporal allocation through control theory effectively resolves objective conflicts in graph SSL, avoiding the limitations of per-update mixing and providing a principled, interpretable approach to multi-pretext learning.

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

*Songyuan Zhang,Oswin So,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Eric Yang Yu,Matthew Cleaveland,Mitchell Black,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReFORM is an offline RL method that combines flow policies with support constraints enforced by construction, addressing both OOD errors and multimodal policy representation through a reflected flow mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces two key challenges: (1) OOD errors from policy deviation beyond the dataset distribution, which prior methods address through restrictive statistical distance penalties that limit policy improvement, and (2) the need for expressive multimodal policy representations, which diffusion/flow policies provide but without guaranteeing OOD avoidance.

Method: The method first learns a behavior cloning flow policy with bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution. Then it optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while preserving the support constraint, enabling policy improvement within the data distribution.

Result: On 40 OGBench tasks across varying dataset qualities, ReFORM with constant hyperparameters outperforms all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on performance profile curves.

Conclusion: By enforcing support constraints through reflected flows, ReFORM achieves expressive policy representation while preventing OOD errors, establishing superior performance in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types.

Abstract: Cybergrooming is an evolving threat to youth, necessitating proactive educational interventions. We propose StagePilot, an offline RL-based dialogue agent that simulates the stage-wise progression of grooming behaviors for prevention training. StagePilot selects conversational stages using a composite reward that balances user sentiment and goal proximity, with transitions constrained to adjacent stages for realism and interpretability. We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics. Among tested methods, the IQL+AWAC agent achieves the best balance between strategic planning and emotional coherence, reaching the final stage up to 43% more frequently than baselines while maintaining over 70% sentiment alignment.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid neural network verifier using branch-and-bound with an exact NLP-CC upper bounding method that preserves ReLU graph structure, enabling efficient pruning and counterexample generation. Warm-starting and pattern-aligned branching accelerate verification, achieving tighter bounds than PGD and substantial speedups over MIP-based methods on MNIST/CIFAR-10.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks' robustness concerns limit safety-critical deployment; formal verification provides guarantees but suffers from scalability-completeness trade-offs.

Method: Hybrid branch-and-bound framework with NLP-CC upper bounding that preserves ReLU graph structure, warm-started solves, and pattern-aligned strong branching.

Result: Markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across wide perturbation ranges, fast per-node solves, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP verification.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid verifier effectively addresses scalability-completeness trade-offs through exact NLP-CC upper bounds and acceleration techniques.

Abstract: Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $ε-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.

Conclusion: ERI为评估解释可靠性提供原则性框架，推动构建更值得信赖的可解释AI系统，解决高风险应用中解释不一致的根本问题

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效减轻不公平现象，并改善公平性与准确性的权衡。

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

TL;DR: 本文提出RRD，一种基于递归分解-过滤循环的原则性评分标准优化框架。该方法将粗粒度评分标准分解为细粒度判别标准，过滤错误对齐和冗余标准，并采用相关性感知加权，使评分标准集更具信息量、全面性和非冗余性，显著提升LLM评判准确性和强化微调奖励信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于引导LLM评判员的评分标准生成过程难以控制，存在覆盖不足、维度混淆、偏好方向错位以及标准冗余或高度相关等问题，导致评判准确性下降并在强化微调过程中产生次优奖励信号。

Method: RRD框架基于递归分解-过滤循环：首先将粗粒度评分标准分解为细粒度、判别性强的标准以扩大覆盖范围并增强响应分离度；然后通过过滤机制移除错误对齐和冗余评分标准；最后采用相关性感知加权方案防止高度相关标准被过度表示，最终生成信息丰富、全面且非冗余的评分标准集。

Result: 实验表明，RRD在JudgeBench和PPE上均实现显著提升，使GPT-4o和Llama3.1-405B评判员达到顶尖性能，JudgeBench最高提升+17.7分。在WildChat强化微调中，RRD提供更强的学习信号，奖励提升最高达160%（Qwen3-4B）和60%（Llama3.1-8B），远超基线的10-20%，且增益可迁移至HealthBench-Hard和BiGGen Bench。

Conclusion: RRD确立了递归评分标准优化作为开放域LLM评判和奖励建模的可扩展且可解释的基础框架。

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

Conclusion: SemPipes successfully automates optimization of tabular ML data operations through LLM-based code synthesis, offering a promising approach to reduce manual effort and expertise requirements in ML pipeline design.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

### [102] [Decoupled Orthogonal Dynamics: Regularization for Deep Network Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05136)
*Hao Chen,Jinghui Yuan,Hanmin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "Radial Tug-of-War" flaw in AdamW where weight decay conflicts with gradient-driven norm growth, causing oscillations that corrupt second-moment estimates; it proposes AdamO which orthogonally decouples radial norm control (via SGD-style updates) from tangential feature learning (via Adam's preconditioning), achieving better generalization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges AdamW's optimality by revealing a fundamental conflict: gradients naturally increase parameter norms to expand model capacity while weight decay uniformly suppresses them, creating radial oscillations that inject noise into adaptive moment estimates and disrupt delicate directional feature learning.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling implemented as AdamO: (1) a simplified SGD update handles 1D radial norm control, (2) Adam's adaptive preconditioning operates exclusively in the tangential subspace, (3) curvature-adaptive radial step sizing, and (4) architecture-aware projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters.

Result: Empirical evaluations on computer vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate that AdamO outperforms AdamW in generalization performance and training stability without requiring additional complex constraints or computational overhead.

Conclusion: Decoupling magnitude (radial) and direction (tangential) dynamics in optimization is a principled design strategy that resolves inherent conflicts in AdamW, suggesting future optimizer research should treat these orthogonal components independently for improved performance.

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

Conclusion: 方法有效解决隐藏状态挑战，为实际应用的算法选择提供实用建议。

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes fairness under group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), proving equalized odds is invariant while demographic parity inevitably drifts, and proposes TAP-GPPS: a label-free algorithm that achieves target-domain fairness by estimating prevalences and adjusting thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning fairness models trained on historical data face distribution shift upon deployment, particularly when outcome prevalence changes unequally across demographic groups (e.g., disease rates or loan defaults shifting differently for different populations), raising concerns about whether fairness guarantees persist in new environments.

Method: Theoretical analysis of GPPS where P(Y=1|A=a) changes but P(X|Y,A) remains stable; proves structural invariance properties of fairness criteria; establishes identifiability of target-domain metrics via ROC invariance; develops TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates target prevalences, corrects posterior probabilities, and selects decision thresholds to enforce demographic parity.

Result: (1) Fundamental dichotomy: equalized odds is invariant under GPPS, while demographic parity drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers; (2) Target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable from source labels + unlabeled target data with finite-sample guarantees; (3) Experiments show TAP-GPPS achieves target-domain fairness with minimal utility loss.

Conclusion: The study reveals a shift-robust impossibility result for demographic parity and provides both theoretical foundations and a practical algorithm for maintaining fairness under real-world distribution shift, advancing understanding of when and how fairness guarantees transfer across domains.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIDE is a serving-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation into LLM inference by reusing hidden states as training signals, using adaptive runtime control, and leveraging heterogeneous clusters, achieving up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding with 1.67x faster draft training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM inference, but practical benefits are hindered by evolving workloads and system-level constraints, particularly the need for draft adaptation that doesn't incur high overhead or require model reloading.

Method: The TIDE framework integrates online draft adaptation directly into inference systems through three mechanisms: (1) reusing target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals for zero-overhead draft adaptation, (2) employing adaptive runtime control to selectively activate speculation and training when beneficial, and (3) exploiting heterogeneous GPU clusters by mapping inference and training tasks to appropriate GPU classes.

Result: Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement compared to static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

Conclusion: TIDE provides a practical solution for deploying speculative decoding in production environments by enabling efficient, adaptive draft model training without compromising inference performance or requiring system interruptions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems.

TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

Conclusion: 通过交叉对话多任务学习利用物理耦合信息能有效提升故障分类性能，所提模型架构优于现有替代方案。

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a novel PEFT method that replaces low-rank decomposition with random projection matrices and a compact learnable core, theoretically grounded in compressed sensing and demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks and model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA and PiSSA use low-rank decompositions that may restrict expressivity when singular values are uniformly distributed, limiting adaptation capacity in task-specific scenarios.

Method: CoSA employs compressed sensing theory to express weight updates through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core, enabling low-dimensional encoding and reconstruction of weight updates via random projections.

Result: CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods across 10 diverse tasks (natural language understanding/generation) and 5 model scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families.

Conclusion: CoSA provides a principled framework for efficient and expressive multi-scale adaptation of large language models, overcoming the expressivity limitations of low-rank assumptions.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

Conclusion: 应将能力控制作为与对齐并行的独立目标，通过贯穿模型全栈的纵深防御体系来有效缓解基础模型的滥用风险。

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO) to address Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)'s stability issues in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards. EBPO uses shrinkage estimation to combine local group statistics with a global prior, reducing variance with small groups and preventing vanishing gradients in failure regimes, achieving superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dominant RLVR methods like GRPO suffer from critical stability challenges: high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield zero rewards, limiting training effectiveness and performance.

Method: EBPO regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics via a shrinkage estimator. It dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated using Welford's online algorithm, providing more stable baseline estimation.

Result: Theoretically, EBPO guarantees strictly lower MSE, bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other baselines on AIME and OlympiadBench, demonstrating superior training stability with small group sizes and benefiting from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Conclusion: EBPO successfully resolves GRPO's stability limitations by leveraging empirical Bayes shrinkage, providing more robust and effective optimization for LLM reasoning enhancement with verifiable rewards while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Motivation: 复杂强化学习与多智能体环境中训练的大语言模型行为变化难以理解，缺乏有效的数据驱动可解释性方法来剖析训练动态与行为涌现机制。

Method: 在全面外交游戏的大规模强化学习训练中应用预训练稀疏自编码器（SAE）与LLM摘要技术，提出Meta-Autointerp方法将SAE特征聚类为可解释的训练动态假设。

Result: 发现包括角色扮演、退化输出、语言切换等细粒度行为及高级策略行为；自动化验证90%的SAE元特征具有统计显著性；识别出奖励黑客现象；用户研究表明大多数SAE特征和LLM假设对人类主观无益；部分SAE衍生假设对下游任务具有预测价值，通过系统提示增强使智能体得分提升+14.2%。

Conclusion: SAE与LLM摘要器提供了互补的可解释性视角，Meta-Autointerp框架为未来数据驱动的可解释性研究奠定了实践基础，有助于确保LLM在训练过程中的可信行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

*Chun-Wun Cheng,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SpectraKAN, a novel neural operator that conditions Fourier Neural Operators on input data via cross-attention modulation, enabling adaptive multi-scale spectral mixing while preserving efficiency, achieving up to 49% RMSE reduction on PDE benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral neural operators like FNO use static Fourier kernels that cannot adapt to input-specific multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics, limiting their expressiveness for complex spatio-temporal PDE solutions governed by global system states.

Method: SpectraKAN extracts a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and modulates a multi-scale Fourier trunk through single-query cross-attention, transforming static convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator; theoretical analysis proves convergence to a resolution-independent continuous operator with Lipschitz-controlled modulation via KAN.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks, with up to 49% RMSE reduction over strong baselines, showing particularly significant gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks requiring adaptive behavior.

Conclusion: Input-conditioned spectral modulation successfully addresses the static kernel limitation of existing spectral operators, providing both theoretical guarantees (mesh-independent convergence, Lipschitz control) and substantial empirical improvements, advancing the capability of neural operators for complex PDE modeling.

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

Motivation: 准确的极端天气事件预报对风险管理和灾害缓解至关重要。然而降水临近预报面临显著挑战：基于扩散的生成集成方法计算成本高昂；确定性模型存在对正常降水偏置的问题；常用基准数据集本身存在偏斜，要么以普通降水为主，要么仅限极端事件，限制了实际应用中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效克服了降水临近预报中计算效率和数据不平衡的局限性，为需要准确预报普通与极端天气事件的实际应用提供了高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

Conclusion: 具有显式正交约束的流匹配范式为学习语义对齐的解缠表示提供了原则性解决方案，性能优于现有扩散方法。

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准组合定理导致T次查询的差分隐私预测存在√T的依赖，这在流式场景中效率低下。改进该依赖对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 针对oblivious和adaptive两种在线 adversary 模型，设计流式差分隐私预测器，优化样本复杂度并分析不同概念类（一般概念类与半空间）的界。

Result: oblivious adversary下：样本量|S|=Õ(VC(C)^3.5 log^3.5 T)；adaptive adversary下（半空间）：|S|=Õ(d^5.5 log T)。两者均实现关于T的多对数依赖，优于标准组合的√T。

Conclusion: 该工作显著提升了流式差分隐私预测的效率，使大规模查询下的隐私保护学习更加实用。

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS) 通过去除常数零阶项并重新加权零和 softmax 残差，解决了线性注意力的两个根本限制，实现了数学稳定的权重，允许正负值并执行对比操作，在保持 O(N) 复杂度的同时扩展了可表示函数集合，并在多个序列建模基准测试中匹配或超越标准 softmax 注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力方法虽然将 Transformer 的计算复杂度降低至 O(N)，但通常表现不如标准的 softmax 注意力。研究发现这些方法存在两个基本限制：仅能进行凸组合，限制信息混合方式；以及均匀累积权重偏差导致长上下文时注意力稀释。

Method: 提出 Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS)，通过移除常数零阶项 1/t 并对剩余的零和 softmax 残差进行重新加权，从而创建数学稳定的权重，使单层注意力能够执行对比操作并允许正负值。

Result: ZeroS 在保持 O(N) 复杂度的同时，理论上扩展了可表示函数的集合；在多个序列建模基准测试中，其性能匹配或超过了标准 softmax 注意力。

Conclusion: ZeroS 有效解决了线性注意力的关键局限，提供了更强大的表达能力，同时保持了计算效率，为长序列建模提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

*Yuntai Bao,Xuhong Zhang,Jintao Chen,Ge Su,Yuxiang Cai,Hao Peng,Bing Sun,Haiqin Weng,Liu Yan,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Concept DAS (CDAS), a novel intervention-based model steering method that replaces probability maximization with weak-supervised distribution matching to align intervened outputs with counterfactual distributions. Building on Distributed Alignment Search principles, CDAS uses distributed interchange interventions for more faithful and stable control, showing particular promise in safety applications while complementing rather than replacing preference-optimization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intervention-based model steering methods adapt strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, making them susceptible to overfitting and causing underperformance with unnatural outputs. The core issue is that effective steering requires faithful identification of internal model mechanisms rather than enforcement of external preferences.

Method: The authors propose Concept DAS (CDAS), which builds on Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) and its distributed interchange intervention (DII) mechanism. CDAS introduces a novel distribution matching objective that aligns intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions through weak supervision, replacing probability maximization. This approach enables bi-directional steering and derives steering factors directly from data, reducing hyperparameter tuning requirements.

Result: On the AxBench benchmark, CDAS does not consistently outperform preference-optimization methods but demonstrates greater benefits from increased model scale. In safety-related case studies (overriding safety-aligned model refusals and neutralizing chain-of-thought backdoors), CDAS achieves systematic steering while preserving general model utility. The method shows conditional robustness and complements existing preference-optimization approaches.

Conclusion: CDAS constitutes a robust, conditional approach to intervention-based model steering that is complementary to preference-optimization methods. By focusing on internal mechanism identification rather than external preference enforcement, it provides more faithful and stable control, particularly effective in safety applications and at larger model scales.

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

*Pengyi Li,Elizaveta Goncharova,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies that GRPO's standard objective causes mode collapse by over-reinforcing high-likelihood reasoning paths, and proposes Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) that incorporates Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into advantage estimation to redistribute probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions, achieving superior diversity-accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy optimization methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) converge to low-entropy policies, causing severe mode collapse and limited output diversity in LLM reasoning tasks because the objective disproportionately reinforces highest-likelihood paths while suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains.

Method: Proposed Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) that dynamically reshapes reward signals by incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into advantage estimation. This attenuates gradient updates for over-confident reasoning paths and redistributes probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions to equilibrate confidence levels across all correct responses.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrates significant improvements: on Qwen2.5-7B, the method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and 13.9% in Pass@32, effectively mitigating entropy collapse while maintaining competitive accuracy and achieving better exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed ARM method successfully addresses mode collapse in RLVR by balancing exploration and exploitation, significantly enhancing generative diversity and response entropy without sacrificing accuracy, establishing a more robust paradigm for LLM reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer 在推理时计算与内存成本高昂，现有结构化剪枝方法多依赖重新训练或多阶段优化，限制了训练后直接部署的需求。亟需一种无需标签、梯度、且仅使用少量校准数据的一次性剪枝方案。

Method: 将结构化剪枝视为表示恢复问题，假设被删除的激活和注意力 logits 是保留部分的仿射函数，推导闭式岭回归解，将补偿直接融合到模型权重中，以最小化在校准分布上的期望表示误差。

Result: 在 ImageNet 上的 DeiT 模型实验表明，未补偿的一次性剪枝会导致严重精度下降；而使用 CORP 可在 50% 剪枝率下保持 82.8% 的 Top‑1 准确率（DeiT‑Huge），且剪枝过程在单 GPU 上不到 20 分钟，实际部署效率显著提升。

Conclusion: CORP 提供了一种高效、闭式、一次性的结构化剪枝方法，能够在保持 Vision Transformer 精度的同时大幅降低推理成本，适用于训练后直接部署的场景。

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmbedOpt, an inference-time method that optimizes experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space of diffusion models for biomolecular conformation generation, outperforming coordinate-based posterior sampling while being more robust and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current posterior sampling methods for biophysical inverse problems require aggressive and brittle likelihood weighting when target conformations lie in low-density regions of the prior distribution, limiting their robustness and reliability.

Method: EmbedOpt is an alternative inference-time approach that steers diffusion models by optimizing experimental likelihoods directly in the conditional embedding space (which encodes sequence and coevolutionary signals) rather than in atomic coordinate space.

Result: On cryo-EM map fitting and distance constraint benchmarks, EmbedOpt outperforms coordinate-based posterior sampling in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, demonstrates superior robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude, and enables significant reduction in required diffusion steps for better efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimizing experimental likelihoods in the embedding space provides a more robust and efficient alternative to coordinate-based posterior sampling for solving biophysical inverse problems using diffusion models.

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该统一分析为这些算法提供了迄今为止最优雅全面的理论理解，且具有很强的推广能力。

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

TL;DR: FlowSteer是一种用于大型推理模型的非线性引导方法，通过流匹配学习从冗长到简洁推理的分布转换，在效率和性能上优于线性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽擅长复杂推理但输出过于冗长导致效率低下，现有线性引导方法受限于线性表示假设，需要更精细的非线性控制方法。

Method: 提出FlowSteer，利用流匹配学习一个速度场作为分布转换，实现输入依赖的精确非线性引导，将表征对齐到简洁推理的分布。

Conclusion: 使用生成技术对完整分布传输进行建模，为控制大型推理模型提供了更有效和原则性的基础，超越了限制性的线性假设。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

*Chengxiao Wang,Haoze Wu,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates for deep RL controllers that maintain safety/stability guarantees under dynamics perturbations. By enforcing Lipschitz continuity conditions via adversarial training and regularization, the method achieves significantly improved certified robustness (up to 4.6x) and empirical performance (up to 2.4x) in benchmark and safety-critical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural Lyapunov/barrier certificates only provide guarantees under fixed ideal dynamics, limiting reliability in real-world applications where uncertainties cause dynamics deviations. There is a need for certificates that remain valid under bounded perturbations.

Method: The authors formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient Lipschitz continuity conditions for robustness. They propose training objectives combining adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bounds, and global Lipschitz regularization to enforce these conditions.

Result: The method significantly improves certified robustness bounds by up to 4.6 times and empirical success rates by up to 2.4 times under strong perturbations compared to baseline, validated on Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking environments.

Conclusion: Training robust neural certificates with Lipschitz regularity is effective for ensuring safe RL under dynamics perturbations, enhancing both theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

*Yinan Huang,Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu,Junran Wang,Bo Dai,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sequential Flow Matching, a Bayesian filtering-based framework that accelerates real-time sequential prediction by initializing generation from the previous posterior distribution instead of repeatedly sampling from scratch, achieving competitive performance with far fewer sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion and flow-matching models for sequential prediction in streaming environments suffer from high inference latency because they rely on repeated sampling from non-informative initial distributions, causing potential system backlogs.

Method: The authors introduce Sequential Flow Matching, which treats streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, naturally aligning with Bayesian belief updates.

Result: The method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion models while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, significantly reducing sampling time and latency.

Conclusion: Framing sequential inference through Bayesian filtering provides a principled perspective for efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models, offering a warm start mechanism that accelerates sampling without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

*Zepeng Zhai,Meilin Chen,Jiaxuan Zhao,Junlang Qian,Lei Shen,Yuan Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR方法（如GRPO）在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在梯度误分配和梯度主导问题。本文提出REAL框架，将可验证奖励视为分类标签而非标量权重，通过锚定logits实现单调有界梯度加权，从而更均衡地分配梯度。在数学推理基准测试上，REAL显著优于GRPO、DAPO和GSPO等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法（RLVR）在复杂推理任务上取得了显著进展，特别是GRPO及其变体表现出强劲的实证性能，但这些方法存在两个关键缺陷：正样本上的梯度误分配（Gradient Misassignment in Positives）和负样本上的梯度主导（Gradient Domination in Negatives）。这些问题导致策略更新效率低下且次优，因此需要一种新的优化框架来解决这些梯度匹配问题。

Method: 提出Rewards as Labels (REAL)框架，核心思想是将可验证奖励重新理解为分类标签而非标量权重，将策略优化问题重构为分类问题。在此基础上引入锚定logits来增强策略学习。通过理论分析证明，REAL能够诱导单调且有界的梯度加权机制，实现跨rollout的平衡梯度分配，有效缓解已识别的梯度匹配问题。该方法即使使用简单的二元交叉熵损失也保持稳定。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明：1）REAL显著提高了训练稳定性；2）持续优于GRPO、DAPO等强基线；3）在1.5B模型上，REAL相比DAPO平均Pass@1提升6.7%；4）在7B模型上，REAL继续超越DAPO和GSPO达6.2%和1.7%；5）即使仅使用标准的二元交叉熵损失，REAL仍保持稳定且平均超过DAPO达4.5%。

Conclusion: REAL框架通过将奖励重新解释为分类标签，为RLVR提供了一种更有效的优化范式。其单调有界的梯度加权特性有效解决了梯度误分配和主导问题，带来了更稳定的训练过程和更优的性能表现。该方法在模型规模上展现出良好的扩展性，为提升大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的能力提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

### [128] [GAS: Enhancing Reward-Cost Balance of Generative Model-assisted Offline Safe RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05323)
*Zifan Liu,Xinran Li,Shibo Chen,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAS is a novel algorithm for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning that addresses GM-assisted methods' limitations by augmenting/relabeling datasets at the transition level, using expectile regression to estimate optimal reward-cost goals, and reshaping data distribution, achieving superior balance between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GM-assisted OSRL methods struggle with (1) inability to stitch optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories, and (2) difficulty balancing conflicting reward and cost targets, limiting their performance in constrained sequential decision-making from fixed datasets.

Method: Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS) employs three key techniques: (1) transition-level dataset augmentation and relabeling to construct high-quality trajectories, (2) expectile regression-based goal functions that estimate achievable reward/cost targets from data, and (3) dataset reshaping for uniform reward-cost distribution to improve training stability.

Result: Empirical validation demonstrates GAS significantly outperforms existing methods in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction by enabling better stitching of suboptimal data and accommodating broader ranges of reward-cost return pairs.

Conclusion: GAS successfully overcomes major limitations of GM-assisted OSRL by enhancing trajectory stitching capabilities and automatically learning optimal tradeoff goals, establishing a more effective approach for offline constrained policy learning.

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an information-theoretic framework that recasts pool-based active learning as a noisy lossy compression problem, deriving fundamental lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error through finite blocklength analysis to establish theoretical limits of AL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a unified theoretical understanding of pool-based active learning that captures the interplay between data selection and generalization performance, as existing analyses fail to provide fundamental limits accounting for algorithmic overfitting and inductive bias mismatch.

Method: The framework maps pool observations to noisy symbols, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding, then applies finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression to derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error.

Result: The derived bounds reveal explicit terms for overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, establishing connections to stability theory and extending classical information-theoretic bounds to active learning.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel theoretical perspective on pool-based active learning by establishing fundamental limits that characterize the interplay between data selection and algorithmic bias, unifying previously disparate concepts in AL theory.

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

Conclusion: 该工作为 DLM 可解释性奠定基础，并展示了将 SAE 应用于 DLM 相关任务和算法的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

*Roger Girgis,Rodrigue de Schaetzen,Luke Rowe,Azalée Robitaille,Christopher Pal,Liam Paull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization for constrained policy learning. Identifies that naive multi-component advantage estimation distorts constraint enforcement via mismatched standard deviations, and introduces scalarized advantages to preserve reward-constraint trade-offs. Validated in gridworld and robotics tasks with improved constraint satisfaction and task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO lacks methods for explicit behavioral constraints (e.g., safety rules), which are critical in real-world embodied AI applications. Naive constraint integration breaks optimization due to distorted Lagrangian signals from mismatched advantage component scaling.

Method: Extends GRPO via Lagrangian relaxation with indicator cost functions for constraints. Replaces multi-component advantage estimation with scalarized advantages to maintain consistent standard deviations across reward and constraint terms, preserving intended trade-offs.

Result: Toy gridworld experiments confirm that naive multi-component advantages cause optimization failure (corrupted Lagrangian signals), while scalarized advantages restore stable constraint control. Robotics tasks show Constrained GRPO simultaneously improves constraint satisfaction and task success.

Conclusion: Constrained GRPO provides a simple, effective framework for constrained policy optimization in critic-free settings. Scalarized advantage estimation is essential for correct Lagrangian-based constraint enforcement, enabling practical deployment in embodied AI with foundation models.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

TL;DR: 本研究通过实证评估时间序列基础模型在电力需求预测中的应用，发现简单LSTM基线模型在气候稳定的新加坡市场表现优于多数基础模型，而Chronos-2在气候多变的澳大利亚市场表现最佳，挑战了基础模型普遍优越的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型虽已成为预测新范式，但其在电力需求预测中有效利用外生特征的能力尚不明确，而外生特征对该领域至关重要。

Method: 我们在新加坡和澳大利亚电力市场的小时与日间粒度数据上，系统评估了MOIRAI、MOMENT、TinyTimeMixers、ChronosX和Chronos-2五个基础模型，以带可逆实例归一化的LSTM为基线，并在全部特征、选定特征和仅目标变量三种配置下进行比较分析。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了基础模型普遍优越的假设，凸显了在能源领域、特别是气候稳定地区开发领域专用模型的必要性。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

### [136] [Robust Federated Learning via Byzantine Filtering over Encrypted Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05410)
*Adda Akram Bendoukha,Aymen Boudguiga,Nesrine Kaaniche,Renaud Sirdey,Didem Demirag,Sébastien Gambs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel federated learning framework that combines homomorphic encryption with property-inference meta-classifiers to simultaneously achieve secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience, demonstrating 90-94% attack detection accuracy with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning's distributed nature creates privacy/security vulnerabilities including inference attacks and Byzantine behaviors. Existing solutions struggle to provide both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience simultaneously, as they typically address these challenges independently.

Method: The approach integrates: (1) Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation using CKKS cryptosystem with automated hyperparameter selection; (2) Property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers trained on shadow updates to detect diverse Byzantine attacks (backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping, shuffling), which reweight encrypted updates to filter malicious contributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks show SVM-based filtering achieves 90-94% accuracy in identifying Byzantine updates with marginal utility loss, encrypted inference runtimes of 6-24 seconds, and overall aggregation runtimes of 9-26 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates Byzantine threats in federated learning while maintaining privacy and model utility, successfully combining encryption-based security with inference-based attack detection.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

### [137] [BLITZRANK: Principled Zero-shot Ranking Agents with Tournament Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05448)
*Sheshansh Agrawal,Thien Hang Nguyen,Douwe Kiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tournament graph framework for efficient LLM-based reranking that aggregates k-wise comparisons into a global preference graph, enabling transitive inference and handling cycles, achieving better accuracy with significantly fewer tokens than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reranking methods for retrieval-augmented generation are either heuristic-limited or inefficient at exploiting rich preference information from ranking decisions, lacking a principled framework for k-wise comparisons.

Method: Proposes a tournament graph framework that treats each k-document comparison as revealing C(k,2) pairwise preferences, aggregates these into a global graph, uses transitive closure for inference, handles non-transitivity via equivalence classes, and employs a greedy query schedule maximizing information gain for top-m identification.

Result: Across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, the method achieves Pareto dominance: matching/exceeding accuracy while using 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable methods and 7x fewer than pairwise approaches at near-identical quality.

Conclusion: The tournament graph framework provides a principled, efficient foundation for LLM reranking that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining or improving ranking quality.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

### [138] [When Are RL Hyperparameters Benign? A Study in Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05459)
*Jan Malte Töpperwien,Aditya Mohan,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigating hyperparameter sensitivity in offline goal-conditioned RL, the study finds it's not intrinsic but exacerbated by bootstrapping mechanisms. QRL demonstrates robust performance with stable optima, while HIQL shows drifting sharp optima due to destructive gradient interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear whether hyperparameter sensitivity in deep RL is fundamental to the problem or amplified by specific training mechanisms, particularly bootstrapping, which remains an open question limiting algorithmic robustness.

Method: Examined offline goal-conditioned RL with controlled non-stationarity via scheduled data quality shifts, comparing HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric RL) under stationary/non-stationary regimes using an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic.

Result: Observed substantially greater hyperparameter robustness than online RL. With ~20% expert data, QRL exhibited stable near-optimal regions while HIQL showed drifting sharp optima. Bootstrapped objectives caused stronger destructive gradient interference directly correlating with sensitivity.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter sensitivity is not inevitable but stems from bootstrapping dynamics. Reducing destructive gradient interference offers a pathway to more robust RL objective design.

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

### [139] [Thermodynamic Limits of Physical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05463)
*Koichi Takahashi,Yusuke Hayashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two bits-per-joule metrics—Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule (recognition efficiency) and Empowerment per Joule (control efficiency)—rooted in stochastic thermodynamics to benchmark AI's physical intelligence by linking information gain and control capacity to energy consumption under explicit accounting conventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems achieve high performance but consume massive energy. The authors aim to connect intelligence capabilities to physical efficiency by developing bits-per-joule metrics that account for thermodynamic constraints, moving beyond purely computational benchmarks.

Method: The authors develop two complementary metrics using stochastic thermodynamics: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule quantifies structural information encoding efficiency per energy unit within defined boundaries; (2) Empowerment per Joule measures sensorimotor control channel capacity per energetic cost. They establish theoretical foundations using thermodynamic-learning inequalities and Landauer's principle, provide decoupling constructions to test boundary assumptions, and align epiplexity with compute-bounded Minimum Description Length (MDL) for empirical applications.

Result: 1. Derived a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for information acquisition as a corollary of thermodynamic-learning inequality. 2. Demonstrated that Landauer-scaled costs are valid benchmarks only under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions. 3. Constructed a decoupling showing information gain and dissipation need not be tightly coupled without proper accounting of external low-entropy resources. 4. Aligned epiplexity with MDL-based surrogates for practical settings. 5. Proposed a unified efficiency framework with a minimal checklist (boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining, horizon/reset, cost conventions) for consistent bits-per-joule comparisons.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a rigorous thermodynamic foundation for measuring AI efficiency through two distinct axes (recognition vs. control), provides both theoretical benchmarks and practical MDL surrogates, and proposes a unified framework with explicit accounting conventions to enable fair, consistent comparisons of physical intelligence across systems, ultimately bridging computational performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

### [140] [A Unified Framework for Rethinking Policy Divergence Measures in GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05494)
*Qingyuan Wu,Yuhui Wang,Simon Sinong Zhan,Yanning Dai,Shilong Deng,Sarra Habchi,Qi Zhu,Matthias Gallé,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified clipping framework for RLVR that generalizes policy divergence measures beyond likelihood ratios, identifying KL3—a variance-reduced Monte Carlo KL estimator—as an effective constraint. The KL3-based approach enables asymmetric clipping that promotes exploration while maintaining GRPO's simplicity, improving mathematical reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods like GRPO rely on likelihood ratio clipping for stable updates, but lack a principled understanding of how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. The paper seeks to establish a unified foundation for analyzing these effects.

Method: The authors propose a unified clipping framework that characterizes RLVR methods via a general notion of policy divergence (encompassing likelihood ratios, KL divergences, and alternative measures). They specifically identify and analyze the KL3 estimator—a variance-reduced Monte Carlo KL divergence estimator—as a key policy constraint.

Result: Theoretically, the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, enabling stronger exploration. Empirically, integrating KL3 into GRPO improves training stability and final performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Principled policy divergence constraints are essential for effective policy optimization in RLVR, and the KL3 estimator provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing exploration and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

### [141] [Detecting Misbehaviors of Large Vision-Language Models by Evidential Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05535)
*Tao Huang,Rui Wang,Xiaofei Liu,Yi Qin,Li Duan,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that uses Evidence Theory to detect LVLM misbehaviors by measuring internal conflict and ignorance. EUQ outperforms baselines across hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial attacks, and OOD failures, revealing hallucinations correlate with high conflict while OOD failures correlate with high ignorance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs produce harmful misbehaviors (hallucinations, jailbreaks, etc.) due to epistemic uncertainty, but existing uncertainty quantification methods are coarse-grained and ineffective at detecting these safety-critical issues, limiting deployment in sensitive applications.

Method: EUQ interprets features from the model output head as supporting or opposing evidence, leverages Evidence Theory to aggregate this evidence in a single forward pass, and quantifies both internal knowledge conflict and information gaps (ignorance) for fine-grained misbehavior detection.

Result: EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines across four misbehavior categories. Key findings: hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict, while OOD failures correspond to high ignorance. Layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis reveals the evolution of internal representations.

Conclusion: EUQ provides an effective, efficient single-pass method for detecting LVLM misbehaviors through fine-grained uncertainty quantification, offering new interpretability into model failure modes and enhancing safety for critical deployment.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

### [142] [Unveiling Implicit Advantage Symmetry: Why GRPO Struggles with Exploration and Difficulty Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05548)
*Zhiqi Yu,Zhangquan Chen,Mengting Liu,Heye Zhang,Liangqiong Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies an implicit advantage symmetry in GRPO that limits exploration and difficulty adaptation for LLM reasoning, proposes Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE) to dynamically modulate exploration incentives and difficulty focus, and demonstrates consistent improvements across seven benchmarks for both LLMs and MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR, particularly GRPO, is standard for eliciting LLM reasoning but faces exploration inefficiency and difficulty adaptation bottlenecks due to an implicit advantage symmetry in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE), which prevents effective exploration of novel solutions and fails to adapt to changing difficulty demands.

Method: Based on experimental insights that (i) asymmetric suppression of correct trajectory advantages encourages exploration, and (ii) curriculum-like difficulty scheduling maximizes learning efficiency, the paper proposes Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE) that dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus.

Result: A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across seven benchmarks for both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal language models (MLLMs).

Conclusion: The symmetric property in GRAE is sub-optimal; asymmetric approaches that dynamically control exploration and difficulty focus are more effective for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

*Francesco Alesiani,Jonathan Warrell,Tanja Bien,Henrik Christiansen,Matheus Ferraz,Mathias Niepert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOGDIFF is a framework for exact logical guidance in diffusion models, enabling principled constrained generation with complex Boolean expressions through Boolean calculus conditions, an efficient recursive algorithm, and a hybrid guidance approach bridging classifier and classifier-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack principled methods for constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time; the key challenge is determining when exact score-based guidance for complex formulas can be derived from atomic properties.

Method: Derives exact Boolean calculus providing sufficient conditions for exact logical guidance (circuits where conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine independent or mutually exclusive subformulas); develops efficient recursive algorithm to compute guidance signals from atomic scores and posterior probabilities; introduces hybrid guidance combining classifier and classifier-free approaches.

Result: Enables exact logical guidance for complex constraints with computational efficiency via recursive algorithm, and demonstrates effectiveness on image and protein structure generation tasks.

Conclusion: LOGDIFF provides a theoretically grounded, computationally efficient framework for logical constrained generation in diffusion models, validated across multiple domains including images and proteins.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Message-adaptive graph prompt tuning injects learnable prompts into GNN message passing to adapt pre-trained models to downstream tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks is challenging due to objective mismatches, and existing prompt tuning methods cannot adapt neighborhood interactions because they don't modify message passing.

Method: Proposes message-adaptive graph prompt tuning that injects learnable prompts to reweight neighbor messages and add task-specific vectors during aggregation while keeping the backbone GNN frozen, compatible with common backbones and pre-training strategies.

Result: Achieves consistent gains over prior prompting methods in few-shot settings and competitive performance with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes across diverse node- and graph-level datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides a parameter-efficient, versatile approach to bridge pre-training and downstream tasks by adapting GNN message passing, advancing the state of graph prompt tuning.

Abstract: Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) transfer well, but adapting them to downstream tasks remains challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.

*Rishabh Bhattacharya,Naresh Manwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EdgeMask-DG and EdgeMask-DG*, adversarial edge masking methods that learn worst-case structural perturbations to discover domain-invariant graph representations, achieving new SOTA on OOD benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural shifts in graphs challenge GNNs as topology varies across domains. Existing domain generalization methods use fixed or global augmentations that cannot identify specific domain-invariant edges, necessitating a method to discover consensus across multiple graph structures.

Method: Introduces EdgeMask-DG, a min-max algorithm where an edge masker finds worst-case continuous masks under sparsity constraints to adversarially perturb graph structure, forcing robust GNN performance. EdgeMask-DG* extends this by enriching the graph with feature-derived edges, combining adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs, theoretically grounded in robust optimization.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance across diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks (citation, social, temporal graphs). On Cora OOD, improves worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0% (+3.8 pp over prior SOTA of 74.2%).

Conclusion: EdgeMask-DG* effectively captures domain-invariant structural information through adversarial masking of enriched graphs, demonstrating superior OOD generalization and establishing a robust framework for graph domain generalization.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

TL;DR: 针对DiT中自注意力二次复杂度导致的计算成本问题，本文提出Shiva-DiT，通过残差感知可微分Top-k选择和上下文感知路由，实现静态预算下的高效动态剪枝，在SD3.5等模型上实现1.54倍加速并消除不规则张量开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer（DiT）因自注意力的二次方计算复杂度而计算成本高昂。现有剪枝方法无法同时满足可微分性、效率性和硬件所需的严格静态预算，存在三者的矛盾。

Method: 提出Shiva-DiT，核心是残差感知可微分Top-k选择机制。通过残差感知的直通估计器强制确定性token数量以支持静态编译，同时保持端到端可学习性；引入上下文感知路由器和自适应比例策略，自主学习自适应剪枝调度。

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT成功调和了可微分性、效率和静态预算的矛盾，为DiT提供了高效的部署解决方案，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

Conclusion: PGFM作为首个流匹配蒸馏框架，通过确定性ODE求解和路径引导机制，有效克服了扩散方法的不稳定性和低效性，为高效数据压缩提供了新范式。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

*Mohamad Mohamad,Francesco Ponzio,Xavier Descombes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mode-dependent layers (e.g., BatchNorm) destabilize on-policy RL like PPO by causing policy mismatch and reward collapse during training/evaluation; the proposed lightweight dual-phase training (MDR) stabilizes optimization without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mode-dependent layers (e.g., Batch Normalization, dropout) cause instability in on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO due to behavioral discrepancies between training and evaluation modes, leading to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse.

Method: Proposed Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without modifying the network architecture.

Result: MDR consistently improves stability and performance across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks, and generalizes to other mode-dependent layers.

Conclusion: MDR effectively resolves the destabilizing effects of mode-dependent layers in on-policy RL, enabling reliable training without architectural compromises.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

### [151] [Joint Embedding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05639)
*Amin Oji,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VJE is a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive self-supervised learning framework that combines joint embeddings with variational inference using a symmetric conditional ELBO and heavy-tailed Student-t likelihood, achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks and superior anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods either rely on contrastive learning (requiring large batches/negative samples) or reconstruction-based objectives. The authors aim to develop a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive approach that learns probabilistic representations with proper uncertainty quantification.

Method: VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional ELBO on encoder embeddings using a heavy-tailed Student-t likelihood with polar decomposition to separate directional and radial components. It employs an amortized diagonal Gaussian variational posterior with feature-wise variances shared between posterior and likelihood, eliminating the need for auxiliary projection heads.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. It also outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines on one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection using likelihood-based scoring.

Conclusion: VJE successfully demonstrates that variational inference can be effectively integrated into self-supervised learning, providing both competitive representation learning and principled uncertainty estimation for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, without requiring reconstruction or contrastive objectives.

Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HORAI, a multimodal foundation model for time series analysis, using a novel pretraining paradigm and the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset (MM-TS) to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on forecasting and anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models are limited by their unimodal nature and lack complementary modalities for enhanced understanding. Building multimodal models faces challenges: absence of unified pretraining paradigms and large-scale multimodal corpora, and difficulties in effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities to enhance generalization.

Method: The authors propose: 1) A multimodal pretraining paradigm leveraging endogenous modalities (derived images/text) and exogenous knowledge (news); 2) An automated pipeline to construct MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset with one billion points across six domains; 3) HORAI model with a Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and Time-Frequency Decoder for multimodal feature fusion and generalization.

Result: After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization across modalities and domains.

Conclusion: This work successfully demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of multimodal foundation models for time series analysis, establishing a strong baseline and providing a comprehensive dataset that enables future research in this direction.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

### [154] [Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656)
*Igor Santos-Grueiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that behavioral evaluation cannot uniquely identify latent alignment in LLMs - passing tests doesn't guarantee true alignment, only that the model appears aligned under those specific evaluation conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field implicitly assumes behavioral compliance implies underlying alignment, but this inference has never been formally analyzed as an identifiability problem. The authors question whether benchmarks can actually certify alignment as a latent property.

Method: Formalizes alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability. Introduces the Alignment Verifiability Problem and Normative Indistinguishability to analyze when distinct latent alignment hypotheses produce identical behavioral distributions across all evaluator-accessible signals.

Result: A negative identifiability theorem: Under finite behavioral evaluation with evaluation-aware agents, observed compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. Distinct alignment hypotheses can be normatively indistinguishable, meaning even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot certify alignment as a latent property.

Conclusion: Behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Benchmarks provide upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, not guarantees of underlying alignment. Passing stringent tests reduces but cannot eliminate alternative alignment hypotheses.

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文利用大偏差理论研究SGD的长期尾衰减行为，证明了在非凸成本和重尾噪声下，SGD及其截断变体(c-SGD)的失败概率比现有有限时间界快一个数量级，提供了更强的个体运行长期保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献多关注SGD的高概率保证(固定概率阈值的误差率)，但缺乏对固定误差阈值下失败概率尾衰减率的研究。同时，现有结果均为有限时间性质，无法捕捉现代学习模型(通常训练数百万次迭代)的真实长期尾衰减行为。

Method: 采用大偏差理论框架，分别分析：(1)有界噪声下非凸成本的vanilla SGD最佳迭代梯度范数平方的尾概率；(2)重尾噪声(阶矩p∈(1,2])下截断SGD(c-SGD)的性能。通过建立上下界来量化尾衰减率。

Result: 对于vanilla SGD，获得上界衰减率e^(-t/log(t))；对于c-SGD，衰减率为e^(-t^β_p/log(t))，其中β_p=4(p-1)/(3p-2)(p∈(1,2))，p=2时为e^(-t/log²(t))。下界显示尾衰减率至少为e^(-t)，证明上述结果在多项式对数因子意义下是紧的。相比现有有限时间界(e^(-√t)和e^(-t^β_p/2))，该研究的长期尾衰减速率快了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了长期尾衰减理论的空白，揭示了SGD在长期运行中失败概率的快速衰减现象，为个体算法运行提供了远超以往理论界限的强长期性能保证，对理解现代大规模训练的可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

Motivation: High PV penetration creates operational uncertainty, requiring probabilistic forecasts beyond deterministic point predictions.

Result: Outperformed baselines in accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality on 30 years of data from 259 European regions.

Conclusion: Framework is suitable for uncertainty-aware energy management in renewable-dominated power systems.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework (SCLCS) that selects minimal representative fMRI subsets to benchmark hundreds of FC modeling methods while preserving ranking performance, achieving 90% data reduction on REST-meta-MDD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exhaustive benchmarking of FC modeling methods is computationally prohibitive due to combinatorial explosion, preventing routine pre-analysis evaluation and reproducible neuroscience at scale.

Method: Proposes Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS): uses an adaptive Transformer to learn individual FC structures, introduces a Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify stability and identify foundational archetypes, and applies density-balanced sampling to ensure diversity while preserving model ranking.

Result: On the REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves ground-truth model ranking with only 10% of data, outperforming state-of-the-art core-set methods by up to 23.2% in nDCG@k ranking consistency.

Conclusion: First work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, making large-scale operator comparisons computationally feasible and establishing it as an integral step in computational neuroscience workflows.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了一种结构性 regime，其中标准推断程序虽平滑收敛、校准良好且通过诊断检验，却因观测可靠性内在且不可察觉的退化而系统性地收敛至错误结论，且额外数据会放大误差，暴露了数据驱动科学在认识论有效性上的根本局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学隐含假设数据量增长可提升结论可靠性，但这一信念可能在根本且不可逆的方式上失效，需要检验数据驱动推断的边界条件。

Method: 识别导致推断失效的结构性 regime，并通过最小化合成实验演示在此 regime 下观测可靠性退化如何被推断过程本身所不可察。

Result: 在此 regime 下，额外数据非但不能纠正误差反而放大之，残差与拟合优度诊断保持误导性正常；表明稳定性、收敛性和置信度并非认识论有效性的充分保证。

Conclusion: 科学推断不能无条件依赖于数据可用性，而必须建立在对观测过程完整性的明确约束之上，需超越纯粹数据驱动范式。

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

Conclusion: PBP框架成功将感知学习与POMDP规划结合，为高维观测下的序贯决策提供了可解释、鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.

Conclusion: FedRandom有效缓解了贡献评估不稳定性，为设计公平激励机制奠定基础，促进联邦学习生态可持续发展。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

### [162] [Limitations of SGD for Multi-Index Models Beyond Statistical Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05704)
*Daniel Barzilai,Ohad Shamir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Develops a new non-Statistical Queries framework to analyze limitations of standard vanilla SGD for single-index and multi-index models, addressing the tenuous connection between SQ framework and SGD's actual noise characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SQ framework's adversarial noise assumptions poorly reflect real SGD noise, and existing SGD analyses often require artificial modifications (sphere constraints, tiny learning rates), creating a gap between theoretical limits and practical performance.

Method: Proposes a novel non-SQ analytical framework specifically designed for vanilla SGD, focusing on single-index/multi-index models where target functions depend on low-dimensional input projections.

Result: Framework successfully applies to broad settings and architectures, including potentially deep neural networks, providing more accurate theoretical limits for standard SGD without unrealistic algorithmic modifications.

Conclusion: Establishes a more faithful methodology for studying SGD limitations that better reflects practical gradient descent behavior, enabling rigorous analysis of vanilla SGD across diverse model architectures.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.

*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that fairness-accuracy tradeoffs are often statistical artifacts of subpopulation shift in training data, and proposes an optimal shrinkage reweighting correction that reveals the genuine price of fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning practitioners observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness, yet fairness interventions sometimes appear to improve accuracy. The authors hypothesize both phenomena stem from training data misrepresenting true subgroup proportions (subpopulation shift).

Method: Analyzes subpopulation shift setting (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions). Derives theoretical properties of importance-weighted corrections and identifies an optimal finite-sample shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between training and target mixtures.

Result: (1) Full importance-weighting is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal. (2) Optimal correction is shrinkage reweighting toward training mixture. (3) Apparent fairness-accuracy synergy arises from improper baseline comparison. (4) Proposed protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing genuine fairness-utility frontier.

Conclusion: Fairness-accuracy tension is largely a statistical artifact. Practitioners should first fix representation using shrinkage correction, then evaluate fairness interventions against this baseline to measure the true irreducible cost of fairness.

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AdaBoost算法在弱学习器具有正边缘时可获得指数损失的几何级下降，但缺乏群体公平性约束。本研究旨在将群体公平性约束融入提升框架，同时保持可分析的训练动态，实现公平性与准确性的可控权衡。

Method: FairBoost方法：1）将集成模型诱导的指数权重分布投影到满足公平约束的凸分布集上作为重加权替代；2）基于投影后的公平分布训练弱学习器。核心理论洞见在于，分布投影会降低弱学习器的有效边缘，降低量由投影的KL散度控制。

Result: 证明了指数损失界，其收敛速率等于弱学习器边缘减去公平成本项δ_t=√(KL(w^t||q^t)/2)。该结果直接量化了提升动态中的准确率-公平性权衡。在标准基准数据集上的实验验证了理论预测，并显示出具有竞争力的公平-准确率权衡及稳定的训练曲线。

Conclusion: FairBoost提供了一种理论严谨的方法，将群体公平性约束纳入提升框架，通过KL散度明确量化了公平性引入的代价，实验验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $δ_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过线性联想记忆模型理论分析了Muon优化器的动力学与缩放行为，证明其在分层频谱数据上相比梯度下降（GD）具有指数级加速优势，可解释为一种自适应任务对齐的隐式矩阵预处理机制，并在合成数据和LLaMA预训练中验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Muon优化器（通过矩阵符号更新参数）已展现出强大的实证性能，但其动力学特性和缩放行为的理论基础尚不清晰，亟需在受控环境中揭示其工作机制及相对于传统梯度下降的理论优势。

Method: 研究采用线性联想记忆模型，结合softmax检索和查询-答案对的层级频率谱（含/不含标签噪声），对比分析梯度下降与Muon优化器在不同频率分量上的学习动态。

Result: 梯度下降学习频率分量的速率高度不平衡，受低频分量制约；Muon则缓解了这一问题，实现更快且均匀的学习进度。无噪声情况下，Muon相对于GD实现指数级加速；在具有幂律衰减频谱的噪声场景中，推导出Muon的优化缩放律并证明其优于GD的缩放效率。理论揭示Muon可视为由自适应任务对齐和块对称梯度结构产生的隐式矩阵预处理，而SignGD需依赖未知任务表示的oracle访问才能匹配其性能，实践中不可行。合成长尾分类和LLaMA风格预训练实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: Muon优化器在理论框架下被证明具有显著优于梯度下降的收敛速度和缩放效率，其优势源于内在的隐式预处理机制，且无需oracle信息，这为其在大规模模型训练中的有效性提供了坚实的理论支撑。

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

TL;DR: 提出变分推测解码(VSD)解决训练-解码差异问题，通过变分推断优化多草案路径，实现9.6%的速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法存在训练-解码差异：训练时优化单贪婪轨迹，而解码需验证和排序多条采样草案路径，导致效率损失

Method: VSD将草案训练形式化为潜在提案的变分推断，最大化目标模型接受概率，构建ELBO目标；引入路径级效用，通过EM算法优化：E步从过滤后验中MCMC采样，M步使用自适应拒绝加权(ARW)和置信度感知正则化(CAR)最大化加权似然

Result: 在LLM和MLLM上实现显著加速，相比EAGLE-3提升9.6%，相比ViSpec提升7.9%，解码效率显著提高

Conclusion: 理论分析证实VSD增加期望接受长度和加速比，实验验证其有效性，为推测解码提供了新的变分推断框架

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

TL;DR: Proposes STC, a cross-domain offline RL algorithm that corrects source transitions using inverse policy, reward, and forward dynamics models to align with target domain dynamics, outperforming filtering-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain policy adaptation with mismatched dynamics remains challenging. Existing methods that filter or modify source transitions may insufficiently exploit valuable source data, limiting adaptation performance.

Method: STC algorithm: (1) Leverages inverse policy and reward models to correct source actions/rewards to align with target dynamics; (2) Uses forward dynamics model to selectively retain corrected samples that better match target dynamics; (3) Combines corrected source data with target data for policy learning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance against existing baselines across various environments with dynamics shifts.

Conclusion: Explicitly transforming source transitions through correction rather than filtering enables more reliable and effective cross-domain policy adaptation in offline RL.

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

*Shutong Ding,Yimiao Zhou,Ke Hu,Mokai Pan,Shan Zhong,Yanwei Fu,Jingya Wang,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel distributional reinforcement learning method called DBC employs diffusion bridge models for critics (value functions) to achieve more accurate distributional value estimation in continuous control tasks, addressing a gap where previous diffusion-based RL only focused on policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RL methods focus solely on diffusion policies while neglecting diffusion critics, despite critics being fundamentally more important for policy optimization. Additionally, due to RL task stochasticity, critics should be distributional, but current distributional critics tend to collapse into trivial Gaussian distributions.

Method: The paper proposes Distributional RL with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC) that directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Q-values using a diffusion bridge model. The method includes an analytically derived integral formula to handle discretization errors. DBC is designed as a plug-and-play component compatible with most existing RL frameworks.

Result: Experimental evaluation on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrates that DBC outperforms previous distributional critic models. The authors claim this is the first work to successfully employ diffusion bridge models as critics in RL.

Conclusion: DBC effectively addresses the limitations of existing diffusion-based RL by applying diffusion bridge models to critics, preventing distribution collapse and enabling more accurate value estimation, which leads to superior performance on continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

Motivation: LDP引入的噪声会严重降低数据效用，导致分类性能下降，亟需在保证隐私的前提下提升学习效果

Method: 将LDP下的隐私学习重构为迁移学习框架（噪声数据作为源域，未观测的干净数据作为目标域），提出：(1) 带噪二元反馈评估机制估计数据集效用；(2) 模型反转通过反转决策边界挽救表现不佳的分类器；(3) 基于效用的加权模型平均整合多个反转模型

Result: 理论证明了LDP下的超额风险界并显示所提方法可降低风险；在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明分类准确率有显著提升

Conclusion: 所提方法在不牺牲隐私保证的前提下，有效提升了LDP下的学习效用和分类性能

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

TL;DR: A training-free method called Bifrost adapts task trajectories using context differences at the hidden state level to bridge context mismatches when agents shift between tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents face context mismatch when reusing successful task trajectories across different tasks. Existing approaches either discard valuable trajectories or use heuristic manipulation that incurs fine-tuning costs with no performance guarantees.

Method: The authors identify a context-trajectory correlation and propose Bifrost, a training-free approach that adapts trajectories at the representation level using agent hidden states. Context differences guide trajectory transformation to align with target tasks in a shared space.

Result: Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and fine-tuned self-improvement methods across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts through precise trajectory steering without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

TL;DR: Proposes a principled confidence estimation framework for CT reconstruction using sequential likelihood mixing, providing theoretical coverage guarantees for deep learning methods under realistic Poisson noise models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable confidence estimation in CT reconstruction, especially for deep learning methods in clinical settings; bridging the gap between powerful deep learning estimators and trustworthy uncertainty quantification with theoretical guarantees under realistic noise conditions.

Method: Sequential likelihood mixing framework applied to Beer-Lambert law forward model with Poisson noise; general framework tested on classical algorithms, U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models to construct confidence regions with coverage guarantees.

Result: Deep reconstruction methods achieve substantially tighter confidence regions than classical methods while maintaining theoretical coverage guarantees; framework successfully detects hallucinations and generates interpretable confidence visualizations.

Conclusion: Establishes deep models as both powerful estimators and reliable uncertainty-aware tools for medical imaging, combining the benefits of tight confidence quantification with rigorous theoretical coverage guarantees.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

*Artem Riabinin,Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Martin Takáč,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive learning rate scheduler with automatic warm-up duration for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon, Lion), based on a generalized smoothness assumption linking curvature to suboptimality. It provides theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrates superior performance in LLM pretraining without extra hyperparameter search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretically grounded and practical adaptive learning rate scheduling strategies for emerging norm-constrained optimizers, addressing the heuristic nature of current warm-up and decay approaches.

Method: 1) Introduces a generalized smoothness assumption where local curvature decreases with suboptimality gap. 2) Derives convergence guarantees that naturally yield warm-up followed by decay schedules. 3) Develops a practical scheduler using standard hyperparameters that automatically adapts warm-up duration.

Result: The proposed adaptive warm-up scheduler consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the best manually tuned schedules across various LLaMA architecture pretraining setups, eliminating the need for additional hyperparameter search.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges theory and practice, providing both a theoretical foundation for learning rate scheduling in norm-constrained optimization and a simple, effective adaptive scheduler that automates warm-up duration selection.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 针对低秩矩阵感知的非凸优化困境，本文提出模拟预言方向(SOD)逃离机制，无需实际张量提升即可确定性逃离虚假局部极小值，兼具计算效率与理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩矩阵感知问题因存在大量欺骗性局部极小值而难以优化；尽管过参数化张量提升可改善地形，但计算成本过高，亟需一种模拟其优势而规避计算瓶颈的方法。

Method: 设计模拟预言方向(SOD)机制，通过数学框架将过参数化空间的逃逸方向投影至原始参数空间，保证从局部极小值点的目标函数值严格下降，避免显式张量提升。

Result: 数值验证表明SOD能有效逃离局部极小值、收敛至全局最优，且计算开销远低于显式张量过参数化，实现效率与性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 本研究提供首个确定性逃离虚假局部极小值的理论框架，揭示了模拟过参数化在复杂非凸优化中的普适价值，对机器学习优化理论具有nontrivial意义。

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

TL;DR: ContextBench: A process-oriented evaluation framework for context retrieval in LLM-based coding agents, revealing that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields marginal gains, LLMs favor recall over precision, and significant gaps exist between explored and utilized context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化代码修复评估仅关注最终成功率，缺乏对智能体在问题解决过程中如何检索和使用代码上下文机制的深入理解，无法揭示其内部推理过程的有效性。

Method: 构建ContextBench基准，包含66个仓库中1,136个跨8种编程语言的issue修复任务，每项任务均配有人工标注的黄金上下文。实现自动化评估框架，追踪智能体轨迹并量化上下文召回率、精确率和效率指标。

Result: 对4个前沿LLM和5个编码智能体的评估显示：1) 复杂智能体 scaffolding 仅带来边际改进（"苦涩教训"）；2) LLMs系统性地偏向高召回而非高精确；3) 探索与利用的上下文存在显著差距；4) 黄金上下文为引导LLM推理提供有效中间信号。

Conclusion: ContextBench通过补充端到端基准测试的中间过程指标，揭示了代码智能体上下文检索的深层行为模式，为改进LLM在软件任务中的推理提供了可解释的评估工具和数据基础。

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks. Data and code are available at: https://cioutn.github.io/context-bench/.

TL;DR: 该论文为PARITY问题构建了一个具有softmax、长度无关且多项式有界的位置编码、无LayerNorm的变压器模型，并证明单头单层变压器无法解决PARITY，首次给出了计算PARITY的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer架构已提出近十年，但对其计算能力仍缺乏理解。特别是能否用单层变压器解决PARITY问题，现有构造至少需要2层且依赖不实用的特性（长度相关位置编码、hardmax、无正则化的LayerNorm或无法因果掩码）。

Method: 提出新的PARITY变压器构造：使用softmax、长度无关且多项式有界的位置编码、移除LayerNorm，并支持因果和非因果掩码；同时证明单头单层无法计算PARITY的下界。

Result: 实现了首个符合实际实现的PARITY变压器构造，并证明1层1头是计算PARITY的严格下界。

Conclusion: 深化了对Transformer计算能力的理解，证实PARITY可用实用架构解决，且深度和注意力头数对计算能力具有根本性影响。

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于正则化非对称校准的LLM后训练量化方法，通过插值对称/非对称校准实现鲁棒性，结合逐次舍入和边界搜索策略，在多个模型和位宽上显著优于传统PTQ，仅带来可控的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型因参数量巨大面临部署时的内存与延迟挑战。后训练量化(PTQ)虽能实现高效推理，但其效果高度依赖量化目标函数与舍入策略，传统方法在激活分布不匹配时表现不稳定。

Method: 理论发现对称与非对称校准的插值可作为正则化项保持PTQ的二次结构并增强对激活失配的鲁棒性。基于此推导了可自然融入非对称校准的逐次舍入算法，并扩展了边界搜索机制以显式权衡量化质量与计算成本。

Result: 在多个LLM家族、量化位宽和基准测试上，所提方法持续优于PTQ基线，困惑度与准确率显著提升，仅产生适度的额外计算开销，且该开销可控。

Conclusion: 正则化非对称校准目标与边界搜索策略为LLM高效量化提供了新思路，在保持理论简洁性的同时实现了实际性能突破。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

*András Balogh,Márk Jelasity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial sequence generation to verify the soundness of generative sequence models in chess, finding that no models are fully sound but some training techniques improve soundness significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative sequence models trained on samples may not capture the complete "world model"; there's a gap between theoretical soundness guarantees and practical verification, especially in complex domains.

Method: Proposes adversarial sequence generation that creates valid sequences to probe models into making invalid predictions; applies this to chess models trained with different recipes; investigates board state probes.

Result: All evaluated chess models are unsound; some training techniques and dataset choices substantially improve soundness; board state probes show no causal role in next-token prediction for most models.

Conclusion: Adversarial verification reveals universal unsoundness in sequence models, highlights the importance of training methodology, and suggests board state representations don't causally influence predictions.

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

### [180] [Chunky Post-Training: Data Driven Failures of Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05910)
*Seoirse Murray,Allison Qi,Timothy Qian,John Schulman,Collin Burns,Sara Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies "chunky post-training" where LLMs learn spurious correlations from discrete post-training data chunks, causing unexpected format-dependent misbehaviors; introduces SURF (runtime detection) and TURF (data attribution) tools that reveal these failures across frontier and open models stem from imbalanced or underspecified data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM post-training datasets encode hidden incidental patterns—formatting-content correlations, repetitive phrasings, and curation artifacts—that are imperceptible to developers but readily learned by models, producing surprising misbehaviors like rejecting true facts based solely on question format.

Method: Proposes SURF, a black-box pipeline that dynamically surfaces unintended model behaviors at runtime, and TURF, a diagnostic tool that attributes these failures to specific chunks of post-training data through systematic analysis.

Result: Applying SURF/TURF to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3) demonstrates that chunky post-training induces miscalibrated behaviors predominantly caused by imbalanced or insufficiently specified post-training data chunks.

Conclusion: Chunky post-training represents a systemic source of LLM miscalibration that current developers overlook; SURF and TURF provide effective mechanisms for detection and data attribution, exposing critical vulnerabilities in post-training curation practices.

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究针对大型语言模型强化学习中策略镜像下降(PMD)的配分函数估计难题，提出实用算法PMD-mean。该算法以采样策略的均值奖励近似log-partition项并在log-policy空间回归，理论证明其隐式优化带有自适应KL-χ²混合正则化的镜像下降问题。χ²项在低奖励时约束大幅概率变化，增强对有限样本误差的鲁棒性。数学推理实验验证了其在性能、稳定性和时间效率上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PMD虽为强化学习提供原则性框架并被应用于Kimi等大模型训练，但理想PMD更新依赖准确的配分函数估计，这在LLM的巨大动作空间和有限rollout条件下构成显著挑战，亟需实用近似方案。

Method: 提出PMD-mean算法：(1)用采样策略下的平均奖励近似log-partition项；(2)在log-policy空间执行回归；(3)理论刻画其总体解，揭示其隐式正则化机制。

Result: 理论分析表明PMD-mean隐式优化带自适应混合KL-χ²正则化的镜像下降子问题。χ²正则化有效约束概率大幅变化，在低预期奖励时产生更保守更新，显著提升对有限样本估计误差的鲁棒性。数学推理任务实验证实其实现更优性能、训练稳定性及时间效率。

Conclusion: 该研究从理论和实践两方面深化了对PMD-mean的理解，揭示了χ²正则化在LLM强化学习中的重要作用，为发展更原则性、鲁棒的RL算法提供了清晰理论路径，推动PMD在大型模型训练中的可靠应用。

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

*Yizhou Liu,Sara Kangaslahti,Ziming Liu,Jeff Gore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates depth's effect on loss in LLMs, finding inverse proportionality likely due to ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning, suggesting current architectures are inefficient but robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in LLMs, the distinct contributions of depth versus width are not well understood and require detailed investigation.

Method: Analysis of both large language models and toy residual networks to quantify how depth affects loss.

Result: Loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably because functionally similar layers reduce error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics, creating an inefficient yet robust regime.

Conclusion: Improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth rather than simple ensemble-like averaging.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统欧氏维度约简方法无法有效处理具有内在非线性流形结构的数据，当数据约束在弯曲空间时，欧氏近似会导致信息损失和结构失真，亟需发展几何感知的维度约简方法以尊重数据的真实流形几何特性。

Method: 聚焦主测地线分析(PGA)作为PCA在流形值数据上的非线性推广，通过黎曼适配扩展判别分析及其他已知维度约简方法；核心是利用测地距离计算、切空间投影和内在统计度量来获得更忠实的低维表示。

Result: 在代表性数据集上的实验表明，与欧氏对应方法相比，黎曼方法提供了更优的表示质量和分类性能，尤其适用于超球面和对称正定(SPD)流形等弯曲空间约束的数据。

Conclusion: 几何感知的维度约简在现代机器学习和数据科学应用中具有重要意义，强调了尊重数据内在几何结构对于获得可靠分析结果的必要性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM合并方法采用欧氏空间的线性算术操作，破坏了预训练权重固有的几何特性（如超球面能量），导致性能下降。需在几何结构保持的框架下实现更有效的模型能力融合。

Method: 1) 对正交微调(OFT)模型：将任务特定的正交矩阵映射到李代数，在正交群的黎曼流形上执行合并，综合考虑适应方向与强度；2) 对通用微调模型（如LoRA、全量微调）：通过正交-残差解耦策略，求解正交Procrustes问题提取正交分量并在流形上合并，线性残差则采用标准加法合并。

Result: 大量实验表明，OrthoMerge能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，在多样化任务上保持模型性能，验证了流形几何保持方法在模型合并中的优越性。

Conclusion: OrthoMerge为LLM合并提供了首个基于黎曼几何的解决方案，不仅适用于OFT模型，还通过解耦策略扩展至通用微调模型，为构建统一多能力LLM提供了新范式。

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

### [186] [Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014)
*Shunxing Yan,Han Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper resolves the open problem of Thompson sampling's inferential instability by proving that two optimistic modifications (variance-inflation and mean-bonus) stabilize arm pull counts for valid asymptotic inference in general K-armed Gaussian bandits, with minimal regret overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson sampling's adaptive data collection creates random arm sample sizes coupled with rewards, breaking classical asymptotic theory for inference. The open question is whether stability can be restored in general K-armed settings, especially with multiple optimal arms.

Method: The authors analyze the K-armed Gaussian bandit through two optimistic Thompson sampling variants: (1) variance-inflated TS, and (2) a mean-bonus modification preserving posterior variance. Stability is defined as concentration of each arm's pull count around a deterministic scale.

Result: Both optimistic schemes achieve stability for any K ≥ 2, with variance-inflated TS resolving the open problem by extending prior two-armed results. This enables asymptotically valid inference while incurring only mild additional regret.

Conclusion: Optimism is a key mechanism that stabilizes Thompson sampling, guaranteeing asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits with negligible regret cost.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the divergence-based perspective of Preference Alignment to general alignment settings like RLVR, proposing f-GRPO and f-HAL frameworks for LLM alignment with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on math reasoning and safety tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the divergence-based view of Preference Alignment objectives to broader alignment scenarios (e.g., reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) where only environmental rewards are available, unifying the approach under variational f-divergence representations.

Method: The authors introduce two novel frameworks: (1) f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), an on-policy RL method, and (2) f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off-policy objective. Both leverage variational representations of f-divergences to align response distributions.

Result: The proposed frameworks provide theoretical guarantees of improved average reward post-alignment. Empirically, they demonstrate superior performance and flexibility over current methods on RLVR (Math Reasoning) and Preference Alignment (Safety Alignment) tasks.

Conclusion: The divergence-based unifying framework successfully extends alignment capabilities beyond preference-based settings, with f-GRPO and f-HAL offering flexible and theoretically grounded solutions for general LLM alignment challenges.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示GNN表达能力的一个独立瓶颈：线性不变读出层通过Reynolds算子导致信息坍缩，擦除非平凡对称感知成分。提出基于投影的不变读出新范式，通过非线性不变统计保留传统平均池化无法捕获的信息，仅替换读出层即可突破WL-hard图对分离难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多将GNN表达能力局限归因于消息传递机制，忽视了读出阶段的内在限制。该工作旨在系统分析线性置换不变读出（如sum/mean pooling）的表达能力缺陷，并证明即使编码器完全表达，读出层本身也会造成不可逆的信息损失。

Method: 采用有限维表示理论，严格证明所有线性置换不变读出均可分解通过Reynolds群平均算子，投影到置换群的不动点子空间。进而设计基于投影的不变读出层，将节点表示分解为对称感知通道并用非线性不变统计量聚合，在保持置换不变性的同时保留被平均操作抹除的信息。

Result: 理论上新发现一个表达力屏障，并给出读出层信息保留能力的可解释刻画；实践中仅替换读出层就能使固定编码器分离WL-hard图对，并在多个基准数据集上提升性能，证明读出设计是GNN表达力的决定性且被低估的因素。

Conclusion: 读出阶段是GNN表达能力的独立瓶颈，传统线性池化存在根本性缺陷。通过引入投影分解和非线性不变统计，可构造更具表达力的不变读出层，这一设计维度对提升GNN性能至关重要且长期被忽视。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

Conclusion: Share是大规模AI系统中终身学习的一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Motivation: 跳跃连接架构中的Softmax自注意力（SSA）存在秩崩溃和雅可比矩阵病态等固有稳定性问题，影响表征学习效果，亟需设计新型注意力机制以规避这些问题。

Method: 提出正交自注意力（OSA），通过矩阵指数将查询-键值构成的斜对称矩阵参数化为正交注意力矩阵；利用查询-键值的低秩结构实现线性复杂度；并推导特殊初始化方案。

Result: OSA的计算和内存复杂度随序列长度线性增长，且所提初始化方案可证明地确保雅可比矩阵良态，使无跳跃连接/归一化层的Transformer更易训练。

Conclusion: OSA成功规避了SSA的不稳定性，为非因果Transformer提供了一种无需跳跃连接和归一化层即可稳定训练的正交注意力机制。

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

TL;DR: This paper establishes the first theoretical guarantee for active inference agents, proving that "sufficient curiosity" simultaneously ensures Bayesian posterior consistency and bounded cumulative regret, providing practical design guidelines validated through real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active inference balances exploration and exploitation via Expected Free Energy minimization, but the precise conditions yielding both coherent learning and efficient decision-making remain unknown, with unclear consequences of insufficient versus excessive curiosity.

Method: The authors derive theoretical guarantees for EFE-minimizing agents, analyzing dependence on initial uncertainty, model identifiability, and objective alignment, then validate the framework through real-world experiments.

Result: A single sufficient curiosity condition ensures self-consistent Bayesian learning (posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret), unifying active inference with Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization.

Conclusion: The work provides actionable tuning guidelines for the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems while theoretically integrating active inference with classical Bayesian methods.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

TL;DR: AP-OOD is a novel semi-supervised method for text out-of-distribution detection that exploits token-level information from language model embeddings beyond simple averaging, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant FPR95 reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent OOD detection research struggles with effectively aggregating token embeddings from language models using only simple averaging. There is also a need for methods that can flexibly leverage limited auxiliary outlier data across both unsupervised and supervised settings for reliable ML deployment.

Method: AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings. It moves beyond average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information from language model embeddings and can utilize limited auxiliary outlier data for improved OOD scoring.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in text OOD detection. Unsupervised results: XSUM summarization FPR95 reduced from 27.84% to 4.67%; WMT15 En-Fr translation FPR95 reduced from 77.08% to 70.37%.

Conclusion: AP-OOD successfully addresses token embedding aggregation challenges by leveraging token-level information and flexible semi-supervised learning, demonstrating substantial improvements in OOD detection performance for natural language tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型缺乏物理世界直觉，监督微调仅改善特定任务表现而无法泛化到新物理场景，表明存在根本性学习局限。

Method: 基于认知科学假设，我们采用强化学习训练模型，使其通过与环境的直接交互来学习物理动力学。

Result: 尽管基于交互的RL训练提升了任务内性能，但模型无法泛化物理直觉至具有相似视觉统计和物理原理的相关任务，无论采用交互还是监督训练。

Conclusion: 环境交互本身不足以学习稳健可泛化的物理规则；尽管任务相似，模型仍表现出较差迁移能力，表明任务特定优化与真实物理直觉获取之间存在持续差距。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

### [196] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques linear AI progress models, proposes "strange intelligence" to describe AI's uneven superhuman/subhuman capabilities, and argues that narrow task performance cannot reliably indicate general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the linear model of AI progress and develop a more accurate framework for understanding AI's observed uneven performance patterns across domains.

Method: Conceptual analysis expanding on Susan Schneider's critique, introducing the "familiar intelligence" vs "strange intelligence" distinction, and formulating a nonlinear model of general intelligence.

Result: AI intelligence is characterized as "strange intelligence" - defying linear patterns by combining superhuman capacities with subhuman performance across and within domains, irreducible to a single linear quantity.

Conclusion: Adversarial testing must recognize that task-specific failures don't demonstrate lack of general intelligence, and domain-specific excellence doesn't warrant assumptions of broad capabilities beyond that domain.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepRead is a structure-aware multi-turn document reasoning agent that leverages document hierarchy and sequential discourse to improve long-document QA, outperforming flat-chunk baselines by mimicking human "locate then read" behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic search frameworks treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native structural priors like hierarchical organization and sequential discourse, which limits their effectiveness for complex document reasoning tasks.

Method: Converts PDFs to structured Markdown via LLM-based OCR, indexes at paragraph level with coordinate-style metadata encoding section identity and order, and equips LLMs with two tools: a Retrieve tool for localizing relevant paragraphs with structural context, and a ReadSection tool for contiguous, order-preserving reading within specified section ranges.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering, with validated synergy between retrieval and reading tools.

Conclusion: The framework successfully operationalizes document structural priors to enable a human-like "locate then read" paradigm, demonstrating the importance of hierarchical representation for long-document reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

Conclusion: 神经符号方法能有效弥合人类-AI协作中的知识鸿沟，通过策略性elicitation使AI在开放世界规划中获得更强能力

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对低地球轨道主动碎片移除的多目标交会约束任务规划问题，对比了三种自主规划器：固定参数训练的掩码PPO、域随机化掩码PPO以及蒙特卡洛树搜索基线，揭示了学习策略的速度优势与搜索方法的适应性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动碎片移除任务需要在燃料和任务时长严格约束下实现高效且自适应的自主规划，而现有方法在分布偏移下的鲁棒性不足，亟需评估不同规划策略在真实轨道动力学环境下的性能边界。

Method: 在包含加注、真实轨道动力学和随机碎片场的高保真仿真环境中，对300个测试案例进行评测，比较了固定参数掩码PPO、域随机化掩码PPO和在线蒙特卡洛树搜索三种规划器在标称、燃料减少和任务时间缩减场景下的表现。

Result: 标称PPO在匹配训练条件时性能最优但分布偏移下急剧退化；域随机化PPO适应性强且仅轻微损失标称性能；MCTS因在线重规划对约束变化鲁棒，但计算耗时高数个数量级。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了学习策略的推理速度与搜索方法的在线适应性之间存在根本权衡，未来弹性ADR规划器可通过融合训练时多样性与在线规划获得更优性能。

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/

*Liang Wang,Junpeng Wang,Chin-chia Michael Yeh,Yan Zheng,Jiarui Sun,Xiran Fan,Xin Dai,Yujie Fan,Yiwei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured multi-evaluator framework to assess LLM reasoning quality in payment-risk settings, revealing significant model-specific biases and alignment variations with human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood, necessitating rigorous assessment frameworks for financial applications.

Method: The study employs a structured multi-evaluator framework combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs cross-evaluate Merchant Category Code (MCC) risk rationales under both attributed and anonymized conditions, with a novel consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score against the mean of all other judges to measure self-evaluation and cross-model deviation.

Result: Results show substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet exhibit negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8% under anonymization. LLM judges score +0.46 points above human expert consensus on average, and the negative bias of GPT-5.1/Claude 4.5 reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation shows four models achieve statistically significant alignment with payment-network data (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77).

Conclusion: The framework provides a replicable methodology for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and underscores the critical need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

### [206] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DemPO introduces algorithmic sortition to preference alignment, using Hard Panel (exclusive sampling) and Soft Panel (reweighting) schemes to ensure demographic representativeness, consistently outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF and similar methods suffer from biased human rater pools that don't represent diverse demographics, potentially encoding skewed values in AI systems.

Method: Democratic Preference Optimization (DemPO) applies algorithmic sortition to create representative mini-publics. Hard Panel trains exclusively on quota-satisfied samples; Soft Panel reweights all raters by their inclusion probability, mathematically equivalent to Hard Panel expectation.

Result: Evaluated on Llama models (1B-8B parameters), Hard Panel consistently ranked first across six aggregation methods, while Soft Panel outperformed unweighted baseline. Effects grew with model capacity, demonstrating that representativeness at data collection stage improves alignment.

Conclusion: Enforcing demographic representativeness during preference collection (via sortition) produces AI models that better reflect values from representative publics compared to convenience sampling or post-hoc correction.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

### [207] [SocialVeil: Probing Social Intelligence of Language Agents under Communication Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05115)
*Keyang Xuan,Pengda Wang,Chongrui Ye,Haofei Yu,Tal August,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SocialVeil introduces realistic communication barriers to evaluate LLM social intelligence, revealing 45% reduction in mutual understanding and 50% increase in confusion, with current repair strategies proving insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks assume idealized agent communication, failing to test their ability to maintain and repair interactions under realistic, imperfect settings with cognitive differences.

Method: Developed SocialVeil environment simulating three communication disruption types (semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, emotional interference) based on systematic literature review; introduced barrier-aware metrics (unresolved confusion, mutual understanding); evaluated 4 frontier LLMs across 720 scenarios with human validation.

Result: Communication barriers consistently impaired performance: mutual understanding decreased >45% and confusion increased ~50% on average; adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) showed only modest effects; human evaluation confirmed simulation fidelity (ICC≈0.78, Pearson r≈0.80).

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between idealized and real-world social interaction for LLM agents, revealing significant challenges in handling communication barriers that current methods cannot fully overcome, opening opportunities for future social intelligence research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes CAST-CKT, a chaos-aware spatio-temporal framework for few-shot cross-city traffic prediction that quantifies predictability regimes and uses chaotic consistency for knowledge transfer, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature in data-scarce cross-city scenarios, limiting effective few-shot learning due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts between cities.

Method: CAST-CKT introduces: (1) a chaotic analyzer to quantify traffic predictability regimes; (2) chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modeling; (3) adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; (4) chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment; plus horizon-specific uncertainty quantification.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates improved generalization bounds. Extensive experiments on four cross-city benchmarks show significant improvements in MAE and RMSE over state-of-the-art methods, with interpretable regime analysis capabilities.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling chaos theory principles, CAST-CKT successfully addresses cross-city few-shot traffic prediction challenges, delivering both superior accuracy and interpretable insights into traffic predictability regimes.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究为结构化、可扩展且因果基础的RAG系统奠定了原则性基础。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

Conclusion: 基于注意力汇聚散度的防御策略能有效缓解有害微调风险，通过符号分离机制识别并抑制有害模式学习，为LLM安全微调提供了可实施的解决方案。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Motivation: Deep learning models act as black boxes in medical imaging, creating trust and transparency issues for clinical adoption; this study addresses the critical need for comprehensive interpretability in brain tumour detection to improve reliability and clinician confidence.

Method: Developed a custom CNN trained on BraTS 2021 dataset, then integrated three XAI techniques: GRAD-CAM for spatial region highlighting, LRP for pixel-level relevance mapping, and SHAP for feature contribution quantification.

Result: Achieved 91.24% accuracy in tumour/non-tumour classification; the integrated approach successfully identified full and partial tumours with superior explanatory power, providing both broad regions of interest and detailed pixel-level insights compared to individual XAI methods.

Conclusion: The multi-XAI framework significantly enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis, demonstrating strong potential for improving interpretability and reliability of AI systems in critical healthcare applications like brain tumour detection.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在数据污染和缺乏场景特异性问题，无法有效评估智能体在未见家庭环境中的真实能力，而通用智能体即将广泛部署，亟需环境定制化的评估方法。

Method: 提出TEA系统，采用结构化图表示定义任务：1)交互阶段让智能体主动与环境交互，在执行与生成间形成闭环；2)进化阶段通过任务图重组和复用现有任务生成新任务，无需外部数据。

Result: 在10个未见场景中自动生成了87,876个任务，经验证物理合理且涵盖日常认知能力。基准测试显示SOTA模型在公共基准表现优异，但在基础感知任务上表现糟糕，严重缺乏3D交互意识，且推理能力对任务类型高度敏感。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了在将智能体部署到真实家庭环境前进行原位评估的必要性，揭示了当前模型与实际部署要求之间的巨大差距。

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

Result: recos在标准语义文本相似度基准测试中持续优于余弦相似度，与人工判断具有更高的相关性。

Conclusion: recos为复杂嵌入空间中的语义分析提供了数学原理坚实且实证效果更优的替代方案，提升了相似度计算的准确性。

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil Lupu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an iterative LLM decision-support framework with consistency checking and external feedback for security management, proving hallucination risk control and demonstrating 30% faster incident recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for security management tasks like incident response planning but face significant challenges with reliability and hallucination that limit their practical deployment.

Method: An iterative framework where LLM-generated actions are checked against system constraints and lookahead predictions; when consistency is low, it abstains and uses external feedback (e.g., digital twin evaluation) to refine actions via in-context learning.

Result: Experiments on four public datasets show the framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical guarantees for controlling hallucination risk and bounded regret while practically improving security incident response efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

*Chris Zhu,Sasha Cui,Will Sanok Dufallo,Runzhi Jin,Zhen Xu,Linjun Zhang,Daylian Cain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' negotiation abilities using PieArena, a benchmark based on MBA course scenarios. GPT-5 matches/exceeds trained business students' performance. Joint-intentionality scaffolding helps weaker models more than frontier ones. The study reveals cross-model differences in deception, accuracy, and reputation, suggesting frontier LLMs are capable but lack robustness/trustworthiness for high-stakes settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability in negotiation, a complex business task requiring strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation, which serves as a crucial test for AGI-level performance in realistic economic interactions.

Method: Introducing PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark built from multi-agent interactions using realistic scenarios adapted from an elite business school's MBA negotiation course, with evaluation of both deal outcomes and multi-dimensional behavioral profiles.

Result: GPT-5 demonstrates AGI-level performance by matching or outperforming trained MBA students despite their semester of negotiation instruction. Joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding yields asymmetric benefits (significant gains for mid/lower-tier models, diminishing returns for frontier models). Multi-dimensional behavioral profiling reveals cross-model heterogeneity in deception, computational accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation that deal-outcome-only benchmarks would mask.

Conclusion: Frontier language agents possess sufficient intellectual and psychological capabilities for deployment in high-stakes economic negotiation settings, but critical challenges persist regarding their robustness and trustworthiness.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

### [218] [ProAct: Agentic Lookahead in Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05327)
*Yangbin Yu,Mingyu Yang,Junyou Li,Yiming Gao,Feiyu Liu,Yijun Yang,Zichuan Lin,Jiafei Lyu,Yicheng Liu,Zhicong Lu,Deheng Ye,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProAct is a two-stage training framework for LLM agents that internalizes lookahead reasoning through GLAD (distilling environment search trees into causal reasoning chains via supervised fine-tuning) and MC-Critic (a lightweight Monte Carlo value estimator for policy-gradient algorithms), achieving state-of-the-art planning performance with a 4B-parameter model on both stochastic and deterministic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents suffer from compounding errors when performing long-horizon planning in interactive environments, as their simulated future states become increasingly inaccurate over time.

Method: Two-stage training paradigm: 1) Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD) uses supervised fine-tuning on search-derived trajectories to compress complex search trees into concise causal reasoning chains, enabling agents to learn foresight logic without inference-time search overhead; 2) Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic) provides a low-variance auxiliary value estimator using lightweight environment rollouts to stabilize policy-gradient optimization.

Result: ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy on stochastic (2048) and deterministic (Sokoban) environments. A 4B-parameter model trained with ProAct surpasses all open-source baselines, rivals closed-source state-of-the-art models, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen environments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLM agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning efficiently, offering a scalable solution for long-horizon planning tasks while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes AgentXRay, a search-based framework (Agentic Workflow Reconstruction) to create interpretable, editable workflows that approximate black-box agentic systems using only input-output access, via combinatorial optimization with Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by Red-Black Pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opaque internal workflows in deployed agentic systems (despite LLM capabilities) hinder interpretability and control; existing frameworks lack transparency as black boxes to users.

Method: Formulates AWR as combinatorial optimization over discrete agent roles/tool invocations in chain-structured workflows; uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with scoring-based Red-Black Pruning to balance proxy quality and search depth.

Result: Achieves higher proxy similarity to target outputs and reduces token consumption versus unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets across diverse domains.

Conclusion: AgentXRay successfully reconstructs editable white-box workflows without model parameter access, addressing opacity in agentic systems while maintaining functional fidelity via observable output metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

*Youngcheon You,Banseok Lee,Minseop Choi,Seonyoung Kim,Hyochan Chong,Changdong Kim,Youngmin Kim,Dongkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that solves inter-path adaptation in residual binarization by sequentially deriving binary paths from shared full-precision weights, achieving state-of-the-art 2-bit performance and 4.49× speedup on RTX 4090.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of large language models requires extreme quantization, but residual binarization suffers from inter-path adaptation where parallel binary paths learn redundant features, degrading error-compensation structure and limiting model capacity. Existing heuristic solutions constrain the solution space.

Method: RaBiT introduces a novel quantization framework that algorithmically enforces a residual hierarchy by sequentially deriving each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight. This ensures each path corrects errors from preceding ones. The method includes robust initialization prioritizing functional preservation over weight approximation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance at 2-bit quantization, rivals hardware-intensive Vector Quantization methods, and delivers 4.49× inference speed-up over full-precision models on RTX 4090.

Conclusion: RaBiT successfully resolves co-adaptation issues in residual binarization through algorithmic enforcement of residual hierarchy, redefining the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier and enabling high-performance, hardware-friendly LLM deployment.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着眼科专用大语言模型在患者教育、分诊和临床决策支持中的应用日益增多，必须进行严格评估以确保其安全性和准确性。

Method: 采用横断面研究设计，选取四种参数量<10B的小型医学大语言模型（Meerkat-7B、BioMistral-7B、OpenBioLLM-8B、MedLLaMA3-v20），令其分别回答180个眼科患者咨询问题（共生成2160条回复）。由三名不同年资的眼科医生和GPT-4-Turbo使用S.C.O.R.E.框架（安全性、共识与上下文、客观性、可重复性、可解释性）进行5分制评分，并通过Spearman等级相关、Kendall tau和核密度估计分析评估LLM与临床医生评分的一致性。

Result: Meerkat-7B综合表现最佳（高级顾问、顾问、住院医师评分均值分别为3.44、4.08、4.18）。MedLLaMA3-v20表现最差，25.5%的回复存在幻觉或临床误导内容。GPT-4-Turbo评分与临床医生评估呈强相关性（Spearman rho=0.80，Kendall tau=0.67），但高级顾问评分更为保守。所有模型均存在临床深度和共识方面的不足。

Conclusion: 小型医学大语言模型在眼科问答中具备安全应用潜力，但需建立自动化评估与临床医生审查相结合的混合框架以确保安全临床部署，并支持大语言模型作为大规模基准测试工具的可行性。

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

TL;DR: Proposes OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework using Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) dynamics to model opinion evolution, overcoming limitations of existing PINN methods by deeply integrating multi-level physical priors via Neural ODEs, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PINN-based opinion dynamics models suffer from incomplete physical priors (only covering partial dynamics levels) and penalty-based constraints that cause optimization issues and poor physical transparency, hindering polarization mitigation and cyberspace security efforts.

Method: 1) Interprets opinion dynamics through a Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system derived from interacting particle theory; 2) Coordinates neural networks with physical priors via Neural ODEs to define neural opinion dynamics; 3) Introduces OPINN framework that deeply encodes multi-level (local, global, endogenous) physical principles without penalty-based constraints.

Result: OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and physical consistency in modeling social behavior.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust paradigm for integrating cyber, physical, and social systems through physics-informed deep learning, offering a promising solution for interpretable opinion dynamics modeling and societal polarization mitigation.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THOR is an inductive link prediction method for hyper-relational knowledge graphs that uses foundation graphs and transformer decoders to generalize to unseen vocabularies, outperforming existing methods by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transductive link prediction methods for hyper-relational KGs cannot generalize to unseen entities/relations, limiting their applicability. There's a need for inductive methods that can handle rich hyper-relational semantics while being vocabulary-agnostic.

Method: Introduces relation and entity foundation graphs modeling fundamental interactions in HKGs. Uses two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder for efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference.

Result: Evaluated on 12 datasets, THOR achieves 66.1% improvement over rule-based, 55.9% over semi-inductive, and 20.4% over fully-inductive techniques. Ablation studies confirm key design factors capture transferable structural invariance.

Conclusion: THOR successfully enables inductive link prediction for hyper-relational KGs by leveraging foundation graphs, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across different datasets compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

Motivation: Current GUI agent development is hindered by high-cost manual annotation, poor data quality, and low trajectory diversity in user-behavior datasets (intent-trajectory pairs).

Method: Proposes a collaborative tri-agent MCTS framework (InferAgent/OrchestraAgent/JudgeAgent) with intent recycling for trajectory enrichment and progressive model-in-the-loop training to boost mining success.

Result: GUI agents fine-tuned on M²-Miner's mined data achieve state-of-the-art performance on mobile GUI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for high-quality GUI agent data generation, advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates time series foundation models (TSFMs) for day-ahead electricity price forecasting in volatile Singapore markets, demonstrating they outperform traditional statistical and deep learning models by up to 37.4% MAPE improvement using a spike regularization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity price forecasting is critical for energy market stakeholders but remains challenging due to inherent price volatility and nonlinearity. While TSFMs show strong performance in general time series tasks, their effectiveness for day-ahead EPF in volatile markets is underexplored, representing a significant research gap.

Method: The study implements a spike regularization strategy and evaluates multiple TSFMs (TTMs, MOIRAI, MOMENT, TimesFM) against traditional models (ARIMA, LSTM, CNN-LSTM). Using half-hourly Singapore wholesale market data, models incorporate exogenous factors (weather, calendar variables) where applicable, with performance measured by MAPE improvement.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches across evaluation settings, achieving up to 37.4% MAPE improvement, demonstrating superior capability in capturing complex temporal dependencies and handling volatile electricity price patterns.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets, validating TSFMs as superior alternatives to traditional EPF methods and supporting their adoption by energy market stakeholders.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Method: Integrates Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) using curvature-based SVD truncation to construct stable orthogonal bases, and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP) to suppress irrelevant semantic interference via null space projection

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across customized clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks with demonstrated superior generalization capabilities

Conclusion: The OD-CRL framework effectively addresses critical limitations in conditional representation learning through orthogonal basis optimization and null-space denoising, establishing a new benchmark for criterion-specific feature extraction

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

### [229] [ALIVE: Awakening LLM Reasoning via Adversarial Learning and Instructive Verbal Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05472)
*Yiwen Duan,Jing Ye,Xinpei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALIVE is a novel LLM alignment framework that replaces costly scalar rewards with adversarial learning and verbal feedback to internalize reasoning logic. By unifying problem posing, solving, and judging in a single model, it achieves better generalization and self-correction without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL's scalar rewards create a "reward bottleneck" - they are expensive to scale, fragile across domains, and fail to capture underlying solution logic, preventing models from developing self-contained reasoning principles.

Method: ALIVE (Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation) unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within one policy model. It uses adversarial learning coupled with instructive verbal feedback to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, transforming external critiques into intrinsic reasoning capabilities.

Result: With identical data and compute, ALIVE achieves higher accuracy, significantly improved cross-domain generalization, and increased self-correction rates across math reasoning, code generation, and logical inference benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables self-sustaining reasoning capability growth without human-in-the-loop supervision, offering a scalable approach for general-purpose reasoning alignment.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

### [230] [Phi-Former: A Pairwise Hierarchical Approach for Compound-Protein Interactions Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05479)
*Zhe Wang,Zijing Liu,Chencheng Xu,Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Phi-former, a hierarchical deep learning method for compound-protein interaction prediction that models interactions at atomic, motif, and cross-level scales to better align with biological recognition mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for compound-protein interaction prediction focus solely on atomic-level modeling, which doesn't reflect chemical reality where molecular fragments (motifs/functional groups) serve as primary units of biological recognition and binding.

Method: Phi-former is a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, with designed intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines to enable mutual benefit across different interaction levels.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on CPI-related tasks compared to existing methods. A case study validates that the model accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in compound-protein interactions, providing interpretable explanations for its predictions.

Conclusion: The hierarchical representation learning approach bridges the gap between deep learning predictions and chemical reality, offering interpretable insights that can guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

### [231] [SDFP: Speculative Decoding with FIT-Pruned Models for Training-Free and Plug-and-Play LLM Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05499)
*Hanyu Wei,Zunhai Su,Peng Lu,Chao Li,Spandan Tiwari,Ashish Sirasao,Yuhan Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SDFP is a training-free speculative decoding framework that constructs draft models via Fisher Information Trace-based layer pruning of existing LLMs, achieving 1.32x-1.5x latency reduction without compromising output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' autoregressive decoding creates substantial latency in interactive multimedia applications. While speculative decoding mitigates this, it requires costly acquisition, tuning, and maintenance of effective draft models—either through auxiliary training or complex optimization—limiting deployment practicality.

Method: SDFP performs Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning on a given LLM, using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation to remove low-impact layers. This creates a compact, compatible draft model for standard speculative verification without any additional training or hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup while preserving the target model's original output distribution. The framework eliminates draft model maintenance overhead and enables rapid deployment.

Conclusion: SDFP provides a fully training-free, plug-and-play solution for speculative decoding that democratizes low-latency LLM deployment in multimedia applications by repurposing existing models without modification or auxiliary training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辅助颌面病理诊断缺乏结构化、高质量的多模态数据集，尤其成釉细胞瘤数据覆盖有限且格式不统一，制约模型训练与应用。

Method: 利用自然语言处理从文本报告提取临床特征，对影像数据进行专业预处理与增强，构建整合放射、病理和临床图像的多模态数据集，开发可接收年龄、性别等临床输入的多模态深度学习模型。

Result: 模型性能显著提升：变体分类准确率从基线46.2%提高至65.9%（提升19.7个百分点），异常组织检测F1分数从43.0%大幅提升至90.3%（提升47.3个百分点），基准测试表现优于MultiCaRe等多癌种资源库。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅提供了高质量的成釉细胞瘤多模态数据集，还构建了可适应临床部署的多模态AI框架，通过整合影像与临床数据实现了精准诊疗，推动了患者特异性决策支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

### [233] [Split Personality Training: Revealing Latent Knowledge Through Alternate Personalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05532)
*Florian Dietz,William Wale,Oscar Gilg,Robert McCarthy,Felix Michalak,Gustavo Ewbank Rodrigues Danon,Miguelito de Guzman,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Split Personality Training (SPT), a novel auditing technique that fine-tunes an "honest persona" into LLMs via LoRA adapters to detect concealed misalignment with 96% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting LLM misalignment is difficult because models can learn to hide misbehavior during training; existing auditing methods like black-box testing and mechanistic interpretability are insufficient due to their inability to distinguish misaligned outputs or scale with model capabilities.

Method: SPT fine-tunes a secondary "honest persona" into low-rank LoRA parameters that remain dormant during normal operation; after the main model generates a response, the honest persona is activated via a trigger string to review the response and access latent states for misalignment detection.

Result: On the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism benchmark with Llama-3.3-70B, SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy in detecting concealed reward hacks, vastly outperforming Anthropic's near 0% accuracy, and reveals latent knowledge such as fictional biases inaccessible to external observers.

Conclusion: SPT demonstrates that creating a separate honest persona within LLMs provides an effective auditing mechanism by leveraging internal state access, offering a scalable solution for detecting sophisticated misalignment that evades conventional methods.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

### [234] [Reasoning-guided Collaborative Filtering with Language Models for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05544)
*Fahad Anwaar,Adil Mehmood Khan,Muhammad Khalid,Usman Zia,Kezhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RGCF-XRec integrates reasoning-guided collaborative filtering into LLMs for single-step explainable sequential recommendations, addressing memory inefficiency and collaborative signal gaps while achieving significant performance gains across Amazon datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based recommenders ignore collaborative signals and separate recommendation from explanation, creating memory overhead. The paper aims to unify these tasks by infusing structured collaborative reasoning into language models for more interpretable and efficient sequential recommendations.

Method: Proposes RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework featuring: (1) reasoning-guided CF augmentation via contextual prompting to extract latent preferences and interpretable paths; (2) a four-dimensional scoring mechanism (coherence, completeness, relevance, consistency) to filter noisy reasoning traces; (3) a unified representation network encoding collaborative and semantic signals to condition a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B model.

Result: Achieves HR@10 gains of 7.38% (Sports) and 4.59% (Toys), ROUGE-L improvements of 8.02% (Sports) and 3.49% (Toys), reduces cold-start gap by 14.5% and warm-start by 11.9%, and boosts zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54% (Beauty) and 23.16% (Toys) on 642,503 interactions across three domains.

Conclusion: RGCF-XRec successfully unifies collaborative filtering and explainable sequential recommendation in a single-step process, demonstrating superior generalization, robustness, and training efficiency with a lightweight backbone, making it scalable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

*Yikun Zong,Cheston Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning with reward-guided feedback loops to enable Vision-Language Models to iteratively improve spatial reasoning on Tangram puzzles without parameter updates, achieving near-human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models show systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning (IoU 0.41-0.23 on Tangram tasks), far below human performance, revealing a fundamental gap in AI's spatial cognition capabilities.

Method: A training-free verifier-refiner agent implementing recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-correct predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, inspired by human cognitive processes of trial-and-error and visual correction.

Result: Achieves substantial IoU improvement from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle Tangram cases without model retraining, demonstrating effective test-time self-improvement in continuous spatial domains.

Conclusion: Human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms via ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, advancing self-improving AI from theoretical promise to practical application.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Method: 开展1100名被试的人类实验，将三个经典决策场景改编为对话式聊天机器人任务（简单/复杂对话），利用被试人口统计信息和对话文本记录，在GPT-4和GPT-5上模拟相同交互条件。

Result: 人类被试表现出稳健的决策偏差；LLMs能精确复现这些偏差，但GPT-4与GPT-5在与人类行为模式的对齐程度上呈现显著差异。

Conclusion: 对设计和评估能在交互情境中自适应、具备偏见感知能力的LLM系统具有重要启示，强调需针对不同模型进行特异性评估。

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Resin (a probabilistic programming language) and Reactive Circuits (a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits) for efficient asynchronous probabilistic inference in dynamic environments, achieving orders-of-magnitude speedup by adapting computation based on input signal volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models is computationally prohibitive for autonomous agents requiring real-time belief updates in dynamic environments. Existing methods inefficiently re-evaluate entire models for any change and fail to exploit heterogeneous update rates in real-world information streams.

Method: Proposes a reactive, asynchronous probabilistic reasoning framework. Introduces Resin: a probabilistic programming language merging probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Proposes Reactive Circuits (RCs): time-dynamic DAGs formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams that autonomously adapt based on input signal volatility. Partitions computations based on estimated Frequency of Change, decomposing large inference tasks into memoized sub-problems.

Result: In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, achieves several orders of magnitude speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and enabling reactive real-time reasoning.

Conclusion: By selectively re-evaluating only model components affected by new information through frequency-based partitioning and memoization, the method drastically reduces redundant computation in streaming contexts, making exact inference feasible for real-time autonomous systems.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出"生成式本体"框架，通过将领域知识编码为可执行约束并结合多智能体协作，使大语言模型在保持创造性的同时生成结构有效的领域特定 artifact，如桌游设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统本体擅长描述领域结构但无法生成新内容，而大语言模型虽生成流畅但常违反结构约束（如机制缺少组件、目标缺少终止条件）。现有方法未能有效结合二者优势，导致生成结果缺乏结构有效性或创造性。

Method: 框架将领域知识编码为可执行的 Pydantic schema 约束，通过 DSPy 签名指导 LLM 生成。采用多智能体流水线分配专业角色（机制架构师、主题编织者、平衡评审员），每个智能体带有"专业焦虑"机制防止浅层输出。结合检索增强生成基于历史范例，并通过迭代验证确保机制与组件的连贯性。

Result: 开发 GameGrammar 系统，可根据主题提示（如"生物发光真菌在洞穴生态系统中竞争"）生成结构完整、可玩的桌游规范。输出满足本体约束且保持真正创造性。该模式可推广至音乐创作、软件架构、烹饪艺术等任何具备专业词汇、有效性约束和积累范例的领域。

Conclusion: 约束不仅不限制创造力，反而使其成为可能——正如语法使诗歌成为可能，本体使结构化生成成为可能。

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems. All the related resources, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphMemory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用输入/输出长度的线性函数估算能耗，但实际存在明显能效机制：短-中等输入配合中等输出时效率最高，超长输入或极短输出效率锐减，需精确建模以支持绿色AI部署。

Method: 从Transformer计算与内存访问复杂度推导解析模型；在NVIDIA H100 GPU上使用TensorRT-LLM评估1B-9B参数模型（含OPT、LLaMA、Gemma、Falcon、Qwen2、Granite），输入/输出长度64-4096 token。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

### [241] [Nonlinearity as Rank: Generative Low-Rank Adapter with Radial Basis Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05709)
*Yihao Ouyang,Shiwei Li,Haozhao Wang,Xiandi Luo,Zhuoqi Hu,Yuetong Song,Qiyu Qin,Yichen Li,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GenLoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that replaces explicit low-rank basis vectors with lightweight nonlinear functions (RBFs) to generate them, achieving higher effective ranks with fewer parameters than standard LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's explicit-rank paradigm requires adding more basis vectors to increase model capacity, causing substantial parameter growth due to significant redundancy among these vectors.

Method: GenLoRA maintains latent vectors for low-rank matrices and uses radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize basis vectors, replacing explicit storage with nonlinear generation, which is more parameter-efficient.

Result: Experiments show GenLoRA achieves higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, leading to superior fine-tuning performance across multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: GenLoRA offers a more parameter-efficient alternative to standard LoRA by eliminating basis vector redundancy through generative modeling with lightweight functions.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

*Tianyi Wang,Long Li,Hongcan Guo,Yibiao Chen,Yixia Li,Yong Wang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse in RLVR where valid alternatives' sampling probability vanishes. It proposes Anchored Policy Optimization (APO) that shifts from Shape Matching to Support Coverage, using a Safe Manifold and restorative force to prevent collapse while enabling aggressive sharpening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR suffers from Recursive Space Contraction (RSC) - an irreversible collapse driven by positive sharpening and negative squeezing dynamics that eliminates sampling probability for valid alternatives. Standard KL regularization imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that creates gradient conflict with sharpening needed for correctness.

Method: Anchored Policy Optimization (APO) replaces global Shape Matching with Support Coverage. It defines a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency, and selectively applies a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. Theoretically derived as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage with Elastic Recovery.

Result: Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: APO successfully addresses the RSC pathology in RLVR by shifting from Shape Matching to Support Coverage, enabling both high accuracy (improved Pass@1) and maintained diversity (restored Pass@K) without suffering the irreversible collapse that affects standard methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

### [243] [Mitigating Hallucination in Financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Fine-Grained Knowledge Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05723)
*Taoye Yin,Haoyuan Hu,Yaxin Fan,Xinhao Chen,Xinya Wu,Kai Deng,Kezun Zhang,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework with fine-grained knowledge verification reduces hallucinations in financial RAG systems by decomposing responses into atomic knowledge units and optimizing with both faithfulness and informativeness rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial RAG systems still suffer from hallucinations that contradict retrieved documents despite relying on them for time-sensitive information, creating inconsistency in generated responses.

Method: Proposes RLFKV: decomposes responses into atomic knowledge units, computes fine-grained faithful rewards for correctness, and adds an informativeness reward to prevent reward hacking by maintaining knowledge unit quantity.

Result: Experiments on the FDD task and new FDD-ANT dataset show consistent performance improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: The fine-grained verification approach effectively aligns model outputs with retrieved documents while preserving informativeness, confirming the framework's effectiveness for financial RAG systems.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

### [244] [LeakBoost: Perceptual-Loss-Based Membership Inference Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05748)
*Amit Kravchik Taub,Fred M. Grabovski,Guy Amit,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeakBoost is a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes model internal representations to amplify membership signals, significantly boosting membership inference attack performance without modifying existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current membership inference attacks rely on static indicators like loss and confidence, failing to exploit dynamic model behavior when actively probed, which limits attack effectiveness especially at low false-positive rates.

Method: Synthesizes interrogation images by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective to maximize representational differences between member and non-member samples, then feeds these images into off-the-shelf membership detectors as a plug-and-play enhancement.

Result: AUC improved from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, with TPR at 1% FPR increasing over an order of magnitude. Deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce strongest leakage, with improvements concentrated in gradient-based detectors.

Conclusion: LeakBoost provides a modular, computationally efficient white-box privacy risk assessment tool that advances dynamic membership inference research by actively probing model internals to expose hidden membership signals.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

Motivation: 探究自动AI智能体优化方法在真实世界形式化验证任务（以Rocq自动定理证明为代表）中的适用性，评估提示设计、上下文知识与控制策略等细粒度调优环节的可自动化程度。

Method: 通过将多种自动智能体优化器应用于Rocq证明生成智能体，系统评估其在自动化调优不同组件方面的表现。

Result: 多个优化器均带来显著性能提升，其中简单少样本自举法表现最为一致，但无一能达到当前最优工程化证明智能体的性能水平。

Conclusion: 自动优化方法虽能为形式化验证智能体带来可测量的性能改善，但仍无法替代针对特定领域的深度手工工程优化。

Abstract: This work studies the applicability of automatic AI agent optimization methods to real-world agents in formal verification settings, focusing on automated theorem proving in Rocq as a representative and challenging domain. We evaluate how different automatic agent optimizers perform when applied to the task of optimizing a Rocq proof-generation agent, and assess whether parts of the fine-grained tuning of agentic systems, such as prompt design, contextual knowledge, and control strategies, can be automated. Our results show that while several optimizers yield measurable improvements, simple few-shot bootstrapping is the most consistently effective; however, none of the studied methods matches the performance of a carefully engineered state-of-the-art proof agent.

Motivation: Vision-Language-Action模型作为通用具身智能的核心路径，其训练效率已成为关键瓶颈。现有RLinf等基于强化学习的同步训练框架在环境交互、策略生成和模型更新阶段存在严重资源闲置与吞吐量限制。

Method: 首次实现覆盖环境交互、轨迹生成到策略更新的全异步训练管线，设计多层次解耦架构，包括环境交互异步并行、策略生成流式执行、训练更新解耦调度。

Conclusion: 全异步框架通过系统性解耦设计显著突破VLA模型训练效率瓶颈，为大规模具身智能训练提供高效可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data. This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management. Evaluations reveal that FiMI Base achieves a 20% improvement over the Mistral Small 24B Base model on finance reasoning benchmark, while FiMI Instruct outperforms the Mistral Small 24B Instruct model by 87% on domain-specific tool-calling. Moreover, FiMI achieves these significant domain gains while maintaining comparable performance to models of similar size on general benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在时间知识图谱问答(TKGQA)中的提示策略存在两大局限：1)复杂时间约束下易产生推理幻觉；2)静态提示缺乏与TKG环境的动态交互优化，限制了模型自主性和泛化能力。

Method: 设计TKG-Thinker智能体，采用自主规划与自适应检索双能力：1)通过思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)灌输核心规划能力；2)利用多维度奖励强化学习(RL)在复杂时间约束下优化推理策略；3)实现与TKG的动态多轮交互进行深度时序推理。

Result: 在基准数据集上，使用三种开源LLM的实验表明TKG-Thinker达到最优性能，并在复杂TKGQA设置中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker通过动态交互和双阶段训练有效克服了静态提示的缺陷，为LLM在时序知识推理任务上提供了可扩展的自主智能体框架。

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes AgentHeLLM, a threat modeling framework for LLM-based vehicle assistants that separates asset identification from attack path analysis, introducing a human-centric asset taxonomy and graph-based models for poison/trigger paths, with a practical tool for automated threat discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles create novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. Existing AI security frameworks lack proper "separation of concerns" by co-mingling asset protection with attack methodologies, which is insufficient for safety-critical automotive systems.

Method: The paper proposes AgentHeLLM framework that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. It introduces a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented victim modeling inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes between poison paths (malicious data propagation) and trigger paths (activation actions).

Result: The framework's practical applicability is demonstrated through an open-source attack path suggestion tool called AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses a critical methodological gap in automotive AI security by providing rigorous separation of concerns, enabling systematic threat modeling for LLM-based vehicle systems, with demonstrated practical utility through an automated tool.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

TL;DR: A practical guidance paper addressing LLM pitfalls in Modeling & Simulation, covering non-determinism, data augmentation issues, hyper-parameter misconceptions, and providing diagnostic strategies for informed usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common LLM practices in M&S workflows introduce subtle issues (model collapse, guardrail erosion, non-determinism, information loss) despite seeming straightforward, necessitating principled guidance for practitioners.

Method: Synthesizes common sources of confusion (non-determinism, RAG/LoRA, data decomposition, hyper-parameters) and provides frameworks for principled design, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation.

Result: Delivers comprehensive practical guidance for LLM application in M&S, enabling modelers to make informed decisions about tool selection, configuration, and implementation strategies.

Conclusion: Effective LLM integration in M&S requires deliberate assessment of model capabilities, attention to limitations, and adoption of diagnostic approaches rather than naive application of common practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Integrated transformer architectures with self- and cross-attention mechanisms to model relationships between vehicles, clients, and depot. Conducted experiments on multi-vehicle CVRP instances with 20 clients and 4 vehicles over ten independent runs, evaluating performance using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap metrics.

Result: All three approaches successfully learned effective routing policies. Quantum-enhanced models demonstrated superior performance over the classical baseline, producing more robust and organized routes. The hybrid architecture achieved the best overall performance across all three evaluation metrics. Qualitative visualizations confirmed that quantum-based models generated more structured and coherent routing solutions.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models show significant potential for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems like CVRP, offering both quantitative improvements and qualitatively superior solution structures.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

### [255] [Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting for Urban Motorway Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05983)
*Krešimir Kušić,Vinny Cahill,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes GATTF, a geographically-aware Transformer model using mutual information between sensors to improve motorway traffic forecasting accuracy without increasing complexity, validated on Geneva motorway data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital-twin traffic management requires accurate real-time and predicted traffic data, but existing sequence-based deep learning models face challenges with spatio-temporal complexity, non-linear dynamics, forecasting accuracy, and model complexity.

Method: Introduces GATTF, which integrates geographical relationships between sensors via mutual information (MI) into a Transformer architecture to capture spatial dependencies beyond physical distance, enhancing prediction capability.

Result: Evaluated on real Geneva motorway data, GATTF outperforms standard Transformers in forecasting accuracy while maintaining identical model complexity.

Conclusion: Incorporating geographical awareness through mutual information effectively addresses traffic prediction challenges in digital twins, offering superior accuracy without computational overhead, thus supporting proactive traffic management.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

TL;DR: 该研究提出基于Whisper语音识别模型的双注意力池化方法，用于高效提取情感特征并降低维度，在波斯语数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SER研究受限于缺乏标准大规模数据集，现有研究利用预训练模型进行特征提取，本文探索Whisper ASR系统在语音情感识别中的潜力。

Method: 提出两种注意力池化方法：多头注意力平均池化和QKV池化，用于压缩Whisper表示维度并保留情感特征；在IEMOCAP（英语）和ShEMO（波斯语）数据集上测试Whisper Tiny/Small模型，并比较不同编码器层的性能。

Result: 多头QKV架构在ShEMO数据集上达到最先进结果，未加权准确率提升2.47%；中间层在波斯语SER上表现更佳，相比HuBERT X-Large等大型模型更轻量高效。

Conclusion: Whisper作为SER特征提取器具有潜力，注意力池化可有效降维，为轻量级情感识别提供新方案。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

### [257] [Learning Event-Based Shooter Models from Virtual Reality Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06023)
*Christopher A. McClurg,Alan R. Wagner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) trained on VR participant behavior to model school shooter scenarios. The simulator reproduces empirical patterns and enables scalable evaluation of robot-based intervention strategies that would be infeasible to test with human subjects, providing a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow for autonomous school security development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VR offers controlled, high-fidelity evaluation of school security measures for high-risk scenarios like school shootings, it suffers from scalability limitations. Each intervention condition requires recruiting new participant cohorts, making large-scale or iterative evaluation impractical. This is especially problematic for learning effective intervention strategies that require many training episodes, creating a bottleneck in developing autonomous security solutions.

Method: The researchers developed a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from actual participant behavior in VR studies. The simulator was then used to evaluate a robot-based shooter intervention strategy, validated against empirical patterns from VR data.

Result: The DES successfully reproduced key empirical patterns observed in VR studies. This validation enabled scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that would be impractical to train directly with human subjects, demonstrating the simulator's capability as a high-to-mid fidelity surrogate.

Conclusion: This work establishes a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions, overcoming VR's participant recruitment limitations while maintaining behavioral fidelity for more efficient strategy learning.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

### [258] [Atomic Information Flow: A Network Flow Model for Tool Attributions in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04912)
*James Gao,Josh Zhou,Qi Sun,Ryan Huang,Steven Yoo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Atomic Information Flow (AIF), a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into indivisible "atoms" for precise response attribution. By training a lightweight Gemma3-4B model using AIF signals, they achieve 82.71% accuracy on HotpotQA (28-point improvement) and 87.52% context compression, nearly matching a 7x larger model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-based RAG systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components, which becomes critical as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures. This gap hinders AI explainability and accountability.

Method: The authors propose Atomic Information Flow (AIF), a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into indivisible, self-contained units called "atoms." They model LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink. Inspired by the max-flow min-cut theorem, they train a lightweight Gemma3-4B language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF.

Result: The base Gemma3-4B model achieves only 54.7% accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines. However, post-training on AIF signals dramatically boosts performance to 82.71% (+28.01 points) while achieving 87.52% context token compression. This performance bridges the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly 7 times larger.

Conclusion: AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability in RAG systems. The approach demonstrates that lightweight models trained with AIF signals can achieve performance comparable to much larger models while providing precise traceability of information flow, addressing a critical scalability challenge in multi-agent architectures.

Abstract: Many tool-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components -- a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures. We present \textbf{Atomic Information Flow (AIF)}, a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into atoms: indivisible, self-contained units of information. By modeling LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink, AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability.
  Motivated by the max-flow min-cut theorem in network flow theory, we train a lightweight Gemma3 (4B parameter) language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF. We note that the base Gemma3-4B model struggles to identify critical information with \textbf{54.7\%} accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines (BM25). However, post-training on AIF signals boosts accuracy to \textbf{82.71\%} (+28.01 points) while achieving \textbf{87.52\%} (+1.85\%) context token compression -- bridging the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly $7\times$ larger.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dense retrieval, which encodes queries and documents into a single dense vector, has become the dominant neural retrieval approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.

### [260] [RAG without Forgetting: Continual Query-Infused Key Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05152)
*Yuntong Hu,Sha Li,Naren Ramakrishnan,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that converts transient query-time adaptations in RAG systems into persistent index improvements via correctness-gated feedback, achieving cumulative learning without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query-time adaptations in RAG systems are stateless and recomputed per query, preventing cumulative learning and incurring repeated inference costs. Index-side approaches introduce persistence but suffer from semantic drift and noise accumulation due to heuristic updates misaligned with downstream utility.

Method: ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. It transforms query-time gains into persistent improvements without training.

Result: Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks across 13 domains show consistent gains in retrieval and generation performance, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, while maintaining native retrieval speed with zero inference-time overhead.

Conclusion: ERM successfully amortizes optimal query expansion into a stable retrieval index, enabling cumulative learning and persistent improvements without the semantic drift of heuristic updates or the computational waste of stateless query-time adaptations.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems commonly improve robustness via query-time adaptations such as query expansion and iterative retrieval. While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead. Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT across 13 domains demonstrate consistent gains in retrieval and generation, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, at native retrieval speed.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale semantic theorem retrieval system trained on 9.2 million mathematical theorem statements, demonstrating significant improvements over baselines and proving the feasibility of web-scale theorem search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search tools retrieve entire papers rather than specific theorems, creating inefficiency for mathematicians and theorem-proving agents. While semantic search has advanced rapidly, its effectiveness on large, highly technical mathematical corpora remains poorly understood, representing a significant gap in research and practice.

Method: The authors created the largest public corpus of 9.2 million human-authored research-level theorems from arXiv and seven other sources. They represented each theorem with short natural-language descriptions as retrieval embeddings and systematically analyzed how representation context, language models, embedding architectures, and prompting strategies impact retrieval quality. Evaluation was conducted on a curated set of queries written by professional mathematicians.

Result: The proposed approach substantially outperformed existing baselines on both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval tasks, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale. The system is publicly accessible along with the dataset.

Conclusion: Semantic theorem retrieval at scale is viable and effective, addressing a critical need in mathematical research by enabling precise retrieval of specific theorems from massive corpora. The work establishes a new state-of-the-art and provides valuable public resources for the research community.

Abstract: Searching for mathematical results remains difficult: most existing tools retrieve entire papers, while mathematicians and theorem-proving agents often seek a specific theorem, lemma, or proposition that answers a query. While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of $9.2$ million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On a curated evaluation set of theorem-search queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale.

Abstract: Measuring advances in retrieval requires test collections with relevance judgments that can faithfully distinguish systems. This paper presents NeuCLIRTech, an evaluation collection for cross-language retrieval over technical information. The collection consists of technical documents written natively in Chinese and those same documents machine translated into English. It includes 110 queries with relevance judgments. The collection supports two retrieval scenarios: monolingual retrieval in Chinese, and cross-language retrieval with English as the query language. NeuCLIRTech combines the TREC NeuCLIR track topics of 2023 and 2024. The 110 queries with 35,962 document judgments provide strong statistical discriminatory power when trying to distinguish retrieval approaches. A fusion baseline of strong neural retrieval systems is included so that developers of reranking algorithms are not reliant on BM25 as their first stage retriever.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a novel framework that addresses three key challenges in LLM tool retrieval (documentation inconsistency, semantic mismatch, and multi-aspect utility) through fine-grained multi-field modeling, achieving SOTA performance with improved generalizability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to effectively retrieve external tools from large-scale tool libraries, addressing context window constraints and computational efficiency limitations of treating tool retrieval as traditional ad-hoc retrieval matching raw documentation against user queries.

Method: Introduces Multi-Field Tool Retrieval framework that aligns user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling to handle functionality, input constraints, and output formats across distinct dimensions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across five datasets and a mixed benchmark, demonstrating superior generalizability and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The multi-field modeling approach successfully addresses fundamental challenges in tool retrieval—documentation quality issues, query-document mismatch, and multi-dimensional tool utility—providing an effective solution for LLM tool integration.

Abstract: Integrating external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with real-world environments and solve complex tasks. Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling. Experimental results show that our framework achieves SOTA performance on five datasets and a mixed benchmark, exhibiting superior generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: 该框架通过细粒度、多维度的用户意图建模与丰富媒体信息融合，有效解决了现有方法局限，经实验验证能显著提升用户搜索体验。

Abstract: Re-ranking plays a crucial role in modern information search systems by refining the ranking of initial search results to better satisfy user information needs. However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics.

*Filip Kučera,Christoph Mandl,Isao Echizen,Radu Timofte,Timo Spinde*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction from scientific literature, achieving 86.4% extraction accuracy while highlighting the challenge of over-generation and the need for relevance filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Definitions are foundational to scientific work, but the exponential growth in publications makes manual definition collection impractical, necessitating automated extraction methods.

Method: The authors developed SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline, and evaluated it using novel datasets DefExtra (human-extracted definitions) and DefSim (definition-pair similarity). They tested 16 language models with multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting strategies, and employed an NLI-based metric for evaluation.

Result: LLMs extracted 86.4% of definitions from the test set; multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting significantly improved performance; NLI-based evaluation yielded the most reliable results; however, models exhibited strong tendency to over-generate definitions.

Conclusion: While LLMs demonstrate robust capability in definition extraction, future research must address relevance identification to mitigate over-generation and improve precision in real-world applications.

Abstract: Definitions are the foundation for any scientific work, but with a significant increase in publication numbers, gathering definitions relevant to any keyword has become challenging. We therefore introduce SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction. We test SciDef on DefExtra & DefSim, novel datasets of human-extracted definitions and definition-pairs' similarity, respectively. Evaluating 16 language models across prompting strategies, we demonstrate that multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting improve extraction performance. To evaluate extraction, we test various metrics and show that an NLI-based method yields the most reliable results. We show that LLMs are largely able to extract definitions from scientific literature (86.4% of definitions from our test-set); yet future work should focus not just on finding definitions, but on identifying relevant ones, as models tend to over-generate them.

Motivation: 稀疏检索虽已成为高效搜索的主流方法，但其前向索引结构占用整体索引的绝大部分存储空间，亟需压缩技术来降低存储成本而不损害检索性能。

Method: 系统评估了多种整数压缩技术，发现StreamVByte在内存、精度和延迟间取得最佳平衡；进而提出DotVByte算法，针对内积计算优化，提升压缩效率。

Result: StreamVByte表现最优；改进后的DotVByte在MsMarco数据集上实现了显著的空间压缩，同时维持检索效率。

Conclusion: DotVByte是一种有效的前向索引压缩方案，可在不损失搜索质量的前提下大幅降低存储开销，为大规模稀疏检索系统提供了实用的内存优化手段。

Abstract: Text retrieval using learned sparse representations of queries and documents has, over the years, evolved into a highly effective approach to search. It is thanks to recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search-with the emergence of highly efficient algorithms such as the inverted index-based Seismic and the graph-based Hnsw-that retrieval with sparse representations became viable in practice. In this work, we scrutinize the efficiency of sparse retrieval algorithms and focus particularly on the size of a data structure that is common to all algorithmic flavors and that constitutes a substantial fraction of the overall index size: the forward index. In particular, we seek compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint of the forward index without compromising search quality or inner product computation latency. In our examination with various integer compression techniques, we report that StreamVByte achieves the best trade-off between memory footprint, retrieval accuracy, and latency. We then improve StreamVByte by introducing DotVByte, a new algorithm tailored to inner product computation. Experiments on MsMarco show that our improvements lead to significant space savings while maintaining retrieval efficiency.

TL;DR: Proposes LMMRec, a model-agnostic framework using LLMs to extract motivations from text and align them with interaction data via dual-encoders and contrastive learning, addressing noise and semantic drift challenges in multimodal recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motivation-based recommendation methods treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text, and face challenges in stable cross-modal alignment amid noise and identifying shared underlying motivations across modalities.

Method: LMMRec leverages LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained motivations from text, employs a dual-encoder architecture for cross-modal alignment, and uses Motivation Coordination Strategy with Interaction-Text Correspondence Method to mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LMMRec achieves up to 4.98% performance improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The LLM-driven motivation-aware multimodal framework effectively integrates textual and interaction-based motivations, providing a robust solution for cross-modal alignment in recommendation systems with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Motivation-based recommendation systems uncover user behavior drivers. Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates.

Motivation: Generative recommender systems struggle with modeling extensive historical sequences and massive item spaces, limiting their ability to leverage long-term user behavioral patterns for accurate recommendations.

Method: Proposes GLASS framework with SID-Tier mapping long-term interactions to unified interest vectors, semantic hard search using generated semantic IDs as dynamic keys, adaptive gated fusion, and two sparsity mitigation strategies (semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing).

Conclusion: Successfully integrates long-term user interests into generative recommendation, demonstrating the effectiveness of compact semantic representations and dynamic retrieval for handling extensive user histories.

Abstract: Leveraging long-term user behavioral patterns is a key trajectory for enhancing the accuracy of modern recommender systems. While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了文本嵌入的多任务训练策略，发现简单的批级打散效果最佳，但存在分布外泛化差和增量学习成本高的局限。为此提出BOOM（基于装袋的鲁棒模型合并）方法：通过装袋训练多个子集模型并合并，提升鲁棒性；同时支持在新数据上训练轻量更新模型并与历史模型合并，实现高效增量学习。实验表明BOOM在域内和分布外性能上均优于批级打散，并大幅降低增量学习训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究尚不明确不同多任务训练策略的实际效果差异，且缺乏高效适应新领域和数据类型的嵌入模型更新方法。当前最优的批级打散策略存在两个核心问题：分布外（OOD）泛化能力不足，以及增量学习需要昂贵的完全重训练。

Method: 从数据调度和模型合并两个维度进行系统研究。首先比较批级打散、顺序训练、两阶段训练等策略；进而提出BOOM框架：1）通过装袋在数据子集上训练多个独立嵌入模型；2）合并这些模型为单一推理模型；3）在增量学习场景中，仅在新数据和少量历史样本上训练轻量更新模型，再与现有模型合并。

Result: 批级打散在多项基准测试中表现最强，但BOOM在保持单模型推理效率的同时，显著提升了域内和分布外性能。在增量学习设置下，BOOM相比完全重训练大幅降低了训练成本，且自然支持高效模型更新。

Conclusion: BOOM通过装袋和模型合并有效解决了多任务训练中的鲁棒性和增量学习难题，为构建和持续改进通用文本嵌入模型提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: General-purpose text embedding models underpin a wide range of NLP and information retrieval applications, and are typically trained on large-scale multi-task corpora to encourage broad generalization. However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.

### [270] [AgenticTagger: Structured Item Representation for Recommendation with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05945)

TL;DR: The paper proposes AgenticTagger, a multi-agent LLM framework that builds a controlled vocabulary of hierarchical item descriptors through iterative reflection to address high-cardinality issues in open-ended generation for recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality item representations are critical for recommendation effectiveness, but LLM-based open-ended descriptor generation lacks control over the generation space, resulting in high cardinality and low-performance descriptors that hinder downstream modeling.

Method: AgenticTagger employs a two-stage approach: (1) vocabulary building via a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines a hierarchical, low-cardinality descriptor vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs validating against item data; (2) vocabulary assignment where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items.

Result: Experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that AgenticTagger delivers consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented critique-based recommendation.

Conclusion: AgenticTagger effectively grounds LLM-generated descriptors in a controlled, high-quality vocabulary through collaborative multi-agent reflection, enabling more effective and controllable item representations for recommendation systems.

Abstract: High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.
