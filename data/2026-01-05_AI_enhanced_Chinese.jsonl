An important capability in e-Commerce with hierarchical taxonomies is to select a set of relevant leaf categories that are semantically aligned with a given user query. In this scope, we address a fundamental problem of search query categorization in real-world e-Commerce taxonomies. A correct categorization of a query not only provides a way to zoom into the correct inventory space, but opens the door to multiple intent understanding capabilities for a query. A practical and accurate solution to this problem has many applications in e-commerce, including constraining retrieved items and improving the relevance of the search results. For this task, we explore a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that combines simple tree-search with LLM semantic scoring. Assessing its classification performance on human-judged query-category pairs, relevance tests, and LLM-based reference methods, we find that the CoT approach performs better than a benchmark that uses embedding-based query category predictions. We show how the CoT approach can detect problems within a hierarchical taxonomy. Finally, we also propose LLM-based approaches for query-categorization of the same spirit, but which scale better at the range of millions of queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "e-Commerce\u641c\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5546\u54c1\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08CoT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3e-Commerce\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08CoT\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728e-Commerce\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u67e5\u8be2\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce an academic concept index, which extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them guided by an academic taxonomy.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents.

We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity.

Compact, interpretable rules are distilled from failure traces and injected into the prompt during inference to improve task performance. These rules are proposed by the LLM itself and consolidated using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) objective that favors generality and conciseness. Each rule is stored in both natural language and a structured symbolic form, supporting efficient retrieval at inference time. Experiments on tool-use benchmarks show that this approach improves accuracy on both seen and unseen tools without modifying LLM weights. It outperforms prompting-based adaptation methods and complements finetuning. Moreover, rules learned from one LLM can be reused to improve others, including long reasoning LLMs, highlighting the portability of symbolic knowledge across architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs can be adapted to use domain-specific tools using RIMRULE, a neuro-symbolic approach that injects dynamic rules into prompts, improving accuracy without modifying model weights.", "motivation": "LLMs struggle with reliable tool use in specialized domains due to idiosyncratic APIs, necessitating effective task-specific tool adaptation.", "method": "RIMRULE distills compact, interpretable rules from LLM failure traces.

An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6545\u969c\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u7403\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u76842D\u548c10D\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u7387\u4ecb\u4e8e0.05%\u81f320%\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4ecb\u4e8e1000\u81f310000\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a40000\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf914\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u603b\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u5065\u5eb7\u6837\u672c\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u76ca\u4e0d\u5927\u3002\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u5c11\u4e8e20\u4e2a\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08kNN/LOF\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u5360\u4f18\uff1b\u5f53\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u523030-50\u4e2a\u65f6\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\uff08XGBOD\uff09\u548c\u76d1\u7763\uff08SVM/CatBoost\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u4e3a10\u65f6\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u9009\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We propose a robust NER approach leveraging Noise-Aware Training (NAT) with synthetically injected OCR errors, transfer learning, and multi-stage fine-tuning. Three complementary strategies, training on noisy, clean, and artificial data, are systematically compared. Our method is one of the first to recognize multiple entity types in VET documents. It is applied to German documents but transferable to arbitrary languages.

Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness).

In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleDoCTR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6392\u540d\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u5355\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u5de5\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5de5\u5355\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTeleDoCTR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6392\u540d\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u5de5\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7535\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cTeleDoCTR\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleDoCTR\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u5355\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr":

Leveraging the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, Pat-DEVAL introduces Chain-of-Legal-Thought (CoLT), a legally-constrained reasoning mechanism that enforces sequential patent-law-specific analysis. Experiments validated by patent expert on our Pap2Pat-EvalGold dataset demonstrate that Pat-DEVAL achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.69, significantly outperforming baseline metrics and existing LLM evaluators. Notably, the framework exhibits a superior correlation of 0.73 in Legal-Professional Compliance, proving that the explicit injection of statutory constraints is essential for capturing nuanced legal validity.

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm.

First, conversational context is paramount, with performance saturating rapidly -- 90\\% of the total gain achieved within just the most recent 10--30 preceding turns (depending on the label set). Second, hierarchical sentence representations help at utterance-level, but this benefit disappears once conversational context is provided, suggesting that context subsumes intra-utterance structure. Third, external affective lexicons (SenticNet) provide no gain, indicating that pre-trained encoders already capture necessary emotional semantics. With simple architectures using strictly causal context, we achieve 82.69\\% (4-way) and 67.07\\% (6-way) weighted F1, outperforming prior text-only methods including those using bidirectional context.\n  For linguistic analysis, we analyze 5,286 discourse marker occurrences and find a significant association between emotion and marker positioning ($p < .0001$). Notably, \"sad\" utterances exhibit reduced left-periphery marker usage (21.9\\%) compared to other emotions (28--32\\%), consistent with theories linking left-periphery markers to active discourse management. This connects to our recognition finding that sadness benefits most from context (+22\\%p): lacking explicit pragmatic signals, sad utterances require conversational history for disambiguation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ERC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u53e5\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u5178\u65e0\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u57284\u5206\u7c7b\u548c6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u8bdd\u8bed\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u60b2\u4f24\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u66f4\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u5de6\u4fa7\u5916\u56f4\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u60b2\u4f24\u60c5\u7eea\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u6b67\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ERC\uff09\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u54ea\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728IEMOCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u768410\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e865,286\u4e2a\u8bdd\u8bed\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\uff1aa) \u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c90%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u6700\u8fd110-30\u4e2a\u56de\u5408\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002b) \u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u53e5\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u5355\u53e5\u65f6\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a0\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540e\u4f5c\u7528\u6d88\u5931\u3002c) \u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u5178\uff08SenticNet\uff09\u6ca1\u6709\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002d) \u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57284\u5206\u7c7b\u548c6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8682.69%\u548c67.07%\u7684\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u30022. \u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\uff1aa) \u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u8bdd\u8bed\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08p < .0001\uff09\u3002b) \u60b2\u4f24\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5de6\u4fa7\u5916\u56f4\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\uff0821.9%\uff09\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u7eea\uff0828-32%\uff09\u3002c) \u60b2\u4f24\u60c5\u7eea\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u6700\u591a\uff08+22%\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u6b67\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u5178\u3002\u60b2\u4f24\u7b49\u60c5\u7eea\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8bdd\u8bed\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u60c5\u611f\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing.

Despite recent progress, existing TKG reasoning models typically rely on large parameter sizes and intensive computation, leading to high hardware costs and energy consumption. These constraints hinder their deployment on resource-constrained, low-power, and distributed platforms that require real-time inference. Moreover, most existing model compression and distillation techniques are designed for static knowledge graphs and fail to adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in TKGs, often resulting in degraded reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose a distillation framework specifically tailored for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Our approach leverages large language models as teacher models to guide the distillation process, enabling effective transfer of both structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. By integrating large-scale public knowledge with task-specific temporal information, the proposed framework enhances the student model's ability to model temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and efficient architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving a favorable trade-off between reasoning accuracy, computational efficiency, and practical deployability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08TKG\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349TKG\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u5171\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u5229\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Cho", "Nathan Kallus"], "title": "Exploration in the Limit", "comment": null, "summary": "In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6700\u4f18\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\uff08BAI\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684BAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fd1\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684BAI\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u4f7f\u7528\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c/\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684BAI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65afBAI\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u9519\u8bef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u597d\u60c5\u51b5\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fd1\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u7684BAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fd1\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7ed3\u5408\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery improves realism yet limits creativity, while freedom from reference generates inventive but culturally ambiguous outcomes. The findings define a boundary between visual resemblance and architectural reasoning, positioning computational vernacular reasoning as a framework for analyzing how AI perceives, distorts, and reimagines traditional design intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u4f0a\u6717\u9e3d\u5854\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u7b51\u5f62\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u7b51\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5185\u5728\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f0a\u6717\u9e3d\u5854\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Midjourney v6\u3001DALL-E 3\u548cDreamStudio\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eSDXL\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u4e09\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u62ec\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u3001\u6750\u6599\u3001\u73af\u5883\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e94\u9879\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "AI\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6750\u6599\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bfb\u3002\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5219\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6709\u521b\u610f\u4f46\u6587\u5316\u4e0a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6807\u5b9a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u5efa\u7b51\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790AI\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u60f3\u8c61\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, current RAG approaches focus primarily on performance improvements while overlooking evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles. This study addresses two key gaps: (1) the lack of PICO alignment between queries and retrieved evidence, and (2) the absence of evidence hierarchy considerations during reranking. We present a generalizable strategy for adapting EBM to graph-based RAG, integrating the PICO framework into knowledge graph construction and retrieval, and proposing a Bayesian-inspired reranking algorithm to calibrate ranking scores by evidence grade without introducing predefined weights. We validated this framework in sports rehabilitation, a literature-rich domain currently lacking RAG systems and benchmarks. We released a knowledge graph (357,844 nodes and 371,226 edges) and a reusable benchmark of 1,637 QA pairs. The system achieved 0.830 nugget coverage, 0.819 answer faithfulness, 0.882 semantic similarity, and 0.788 PICOT match accuracy. In a 5-point Likert evaluation, five expert clinicians rated the system 4.66-4.84 across factual accuracy, faithfulness, relevance, safety, and PICO alignment. These findings demonstrate that the proposed EBM adaptation strategy improves retrieval and answer quality and is transferable to other clinical domains. The released resources also help address the scarcity of RAG datasets in sports rehabilitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\uff08EBM\uff09\u539f\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RAG\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565EBM\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86PICO\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u5eb7\u590d\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53caPICO\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\uff08EBM\uff09\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4fPICO\uff08Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u91cd\u6392\uff08reranking\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8bc1\u636e\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06EBM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u30022. \u5c06PICO\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u636e\u7b49\u7ea7\u6821\u51c6\u6392\u540d\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6743\u91cd\u30024. \u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u5eb7\u590d\u9886\u57df\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08357,844\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c371,226\u6761\u8fb9\uff09\u548c1,637\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u30025. \u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1.

Because each candidate is scored against the same frozen anchor set, scores are structurally stable given the same base set, judge, and aggregation code.", "AI": {"tldr": "JP-TL-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u65e5\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u7684LLM\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0-10\u7684LT\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e5\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u597d\u8bd1\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5224\u65ad\u8bd1\u6587\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u793c\u8c8c\u3001\u6697\u793a\u3001\u7701\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u57df\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u7684LLM\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u3001\u7248\u672c\u5316\u7684\u951a\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u80dc\u7387\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u6362\u76840-10\u201cLT\u201d\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "JP-TL-Bench \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u4e0e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u951a\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u951a\u96c6\u3001\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "JP-TL-Bench \u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e5\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u4fdd\u8bc1Q\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u663e\u5f0f\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6781\u9650\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u3002\n2.

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating English counterfactuals and demonstrate multilingual proficiency. However, their effectiveness in generating multilingual counterfactuals remains unclear. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on multilingual counterfactuals. We first conduct automatic evaluations on both directly generated counterfactuals in the target languages and those derived via English translation across six languages. Although translation-based counterfactuals offer higher validity than their directly generated counterparts, they demand substantially more modifications and still fall short of matching the quality of the original English counterfactuals. Second, we find the patterns of edits applied to high-resource European-language counterfactuals to be remarkably similar, suggesting that cross-lingual perturbations follow common strategic principles. Third, we identify and categorize four main types of errors that consistently appear in the generated counterfactuals across languages. Finally, we reveal that multilingual counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) yields larger model performance improvements than cross-lingual CDA, especially for lower-resource languages.

Preprint, machine learning analysis of 500,000 US traffic accidents", "summary": "This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity.

Investigating the Impact of Quantization on Self-Explanations", "comment": "In submission", "summary": "Quantization is widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet its effects on self-explanations (SEs) remain unexplored. SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u9002\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\uff08SE\uff09\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\uff08SE\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u7531\u4e8eSE\u5728\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5fc5\u987b\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9SE\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff08NLEs\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u793a\u4f8b\uff08\u4e24\u79cdSE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9SE\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4SE\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0b\u964d4.4%\uff09\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0b\u964d2.38%\uff09\u51fa\u73b0\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4eSE\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0b\u964d8.5%\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728SE\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001SE\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002NLEs\u6bd4\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9SE\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u7684NLEs\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cSE\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0RNN\u548cLSTM\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6c34\u5e93\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08Sequential RC\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u6c34\u5e93\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4e92\u8054\u7684\u6c34\u5e93\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u4e0eLSTM\u548c\u6807\u51c6RNN\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSequential RC\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8eRNN\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6c34\u5e93\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u6c34\u5e93\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08Sequential RC\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u7684\u6c34\u5e93\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6c34\u5e93\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Lorenz63\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\uff082D\u6da1\u5ea6\u548c\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cSequential RC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8615-25%\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c20-30%\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\uff08SSIM\u3001RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bd4LSTM\u548c\u6807\u51c6RNN\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe1000\u500d\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Sequential RC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u7edfRC\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4LSTM\u548c\u6807\u51c6RNN\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, widely used depression datasets like DAIC-WOZ exhibit strong coupling between linguistic sentiment and diagnostic labels, encouraging models to learn semantic shortcuts. As a result, model robustness may be compromised in real-world scenarios, such as Camouflaged Depression, where individuals maintain socially positive or neutral language despite underlying depressive states. To mitigate this semantic bias, we propose DepFlow, a three-stage depression-conditioned text-to-speech framework. First, a Depression Acoustic Encoder learns speaker- and content-invariant depression embeddings through adversarial training, achieving effective disentanglement while preserving depression discriminability (ROC-AUC: 0.693). Second, a flow-matching TTS model with FiLM modulation injects these embeddings into synthesis, enabling control over depressive severity while preserving content and speaker identity. Third, a prototype-based severity mapping mechanism provides smooth and interpretable manipulation across the depression continuum. Using DepFlow, we construct a Camouflage Depression-oriented Augmentation (CDoA) dataset that pairs depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral content from a sentiment-stratified text bank, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches underrepresented in natural data. Evaluated across three depression detection architectures, CDoA improves macro-F1 by 9%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, consistently outperforming conventional augmentation strategies in depression Detection. Beyond enhancing robustness, DepFlow provides a controllable synthesis platform for conversational systems and simulation-based evaluation, where real clinical data remains limited by ethical and coverage constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "DepFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914dTTS\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6291\u90c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aCDoA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u5b66-\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982DAIC-WOZ\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u4f2a\u88c5\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\uff09\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u60a3\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u6216\u4e2d\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "DepFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u58f0\u5b66\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff08ROC-AUC\uff1a0.693\uff09\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5177\u6709FiLM\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914dTTS\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6291\u90c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6291\u90c1\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "DepFlow\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4f2a\u88c5\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CDoA\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u5e93\u7684\u79ef\u6781/\u4e2d\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u58f0\u5b66-\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCDoA\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u65709%\u300112%\u548c5%\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "DepFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914dTTS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u9650\u5236\u800c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002CDoA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u524d\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6027\u809d\u786c\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u578b\u5b66\u672f\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u901a\u8fc7XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c1\u30012\u30013\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eFIB-4\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u53d7\u8005\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff08AUC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eFIB-4\u30021\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u548c3\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.81\u30010.73\u548c0.69\uff0c\u800cFIB-4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.71\u30010.63\u548c0.57\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c4EHR\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684FIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, the persistent challenge of LLM hallucination has emerged as a critical limitation, significantly compromising the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content. This challenge has garnered significant attention within the scientific community, prompting extensive research efforts in hallucination detection and mitigation strategies. Current methodological frameworks reveal a critical limitation: traditional uncertainty quantification approaches demonstrate effectiveness primarily within conventional question-answering paradigms, yet exhibit notable deficiencies when confronted with non-canonical or adversarial questioning strategies. This performance gap raises substantial concerns regarding the dependability of LLM responses in real-world applications requiring robust critical thinking capabilities. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing an uncertainty quantification scenario in the task of generating with multiple facts. We have meticulously constructed a set of trap questions contained with fake names. Based on this scenario, we innovatively propose a novel and robust uncertainty quantification method(RU).

Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials. Empirically, ClinicalReTrial improves 83.3% of trial protocols with a mean success probability gain of 5.7%, and retrospective case studies demonstrate strong alignment between the discovered redesign strategies and real-world clinical trial modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u6846\u67b6ClinicalReTrial\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faClinicalReTrial\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u5019\u9009\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "ClinicalReTrial\u6539\u8fdb\u4e8683.3%\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "ClinicalReTrial\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4fee\u6539\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $\u03bc$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation.

However, existing approaches often rely on synthetic reasoning annotations or external image retrieval, which can limit interpretability and generalizability. In this paper, we present Geo-R, a retrieval-free framework that uncovers structured reasoning paths from existing ground-truth coordinates and optimizes geolocation accuracy via reinforcement learning. We propose the Chain of Region, a rule-based hierarchical reasoning paradigm that generates precise, interpretable supervision by mapping GPS coordinates to geographic entities (e.g., country, province, city) without relying on model-generated or synthetic labels. Building on this, we introduce a lightweight reinforcement learning strategy with coordinate-aligned rewards based on Haversine distance, enabling the model to refine predictions through spatially meaningful feedback.

We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high.

By exploiting internal links within Wikipedia articles, we infer entity types based on their corresponding Wikidata entries, thereby generating initial annotations with minimal human intervention. Because such links are not uniformly reliable, we mitigate noise by employing and comparing several LLMs to identify and retain only high-quality labelled sentences.

Under review", "summary": "Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization.

While TKGs and their generalization, hyper-relational temporal knowledge graphs (HTKGs), offer a straightforward structure to represent simple temporal relationships, they lack the expressive power to convey complex facts efficiently. One of the critical limitations of HTKGs is a lack of support for more than two primary entities in temporal facts, which commonly occur in real-world events. To address this limitation, in this work, we study a generalization of HTKGs, Hyper-Relational Temporal Knowledge Generalized Hypergraphs (HTKGHs).

A Methodology for Football with Broader Applications", "comment": "Submitted to Sci (MDPI) for peer review", "summary": "This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems.

This study conducts a comparative analysis of three prominent lightweight Transformer models - DistilBERT, MiniLM, and ALBERT - across three distinct domains: customer sentiment classification, news topic classification, and toxicity and hate speech detection. Utilizing datasets from IMDB, AG News, and the Measuring Hate Speech corpus, we evaluated performance using accuracy-based metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as efficiency metrics such as model size, inference time, throughput, and memory usage. Key findings reveal that no single model dominates all performance dimensions. ALBERT achieves the highest task-specific accuracy in multiple domains, MiniLM excels in inference speed and throughput, and DistilBERT demonstrates the most consistent accuracy across tasks while maintaining competitive efficiency. All results reflect controlled fine-tuning under fixed enterprise-oriented constraints rather than exhaustive hyperparameter optimization.

Prior work suggests that models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero undergo sudden mid-trace realizations that lead to accurate outputs, implying an intrinsic capacity for self-correction. Yet, it remains unclear whether such intrinsic shifts in reasoning strategy actually improve performance. Here, we study mid-reasoning shifts and instrument training runs to detect them. Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight. However, their effect varies with model uncertainty. Building on this finding, we show that artificially triggering extrinsic shifts under high entropy reliably improves accuracy.

We propose Defensive M2S, a training paradigm that fine-tunes guardrail models on Multi-turn to Single-turn (M2S) compressed conversations rather than complete dialogue histories. We provide a formal complexity analysis showing that M2S reduces training cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ for $n$-turn conversations. Empirically, on our training dataset (779 samples, avg. 10.6 turns), M2S requires only 169K tokens compared to 15.7M tokens for the multi-turn baseline -- a 93$\\times$ reduction. We evaluate Defensive M2S across three guardrail model families (LlamaGuard, Nemotron, Qwen3Guard) and three compression templates (hyphenize, numberize, pythonize) on SafeDialBench, a comprehensive multi-turn jailbreak benchmark. Our best configuration, Qwen3Guard with hyphenize compression, achieves 93.8% attack detection recall while reducing inference tokens by 94.6% (from 3,231 to 173 tokens per conversation). This represents a 38.9 percentage point improvement over the baseline while dramatically reducing both training and inference costs.

The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit.

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%.

Atomic sentence extraction, the task of decomposing complex sentences into simpler sentences that each express a single idea, improves performance in information retrieval, question answering, and automated reasoning systems. Previous work has formalized the \"split-and-rephrase\" task and established evaluation metrics, and machine learning approaches using large language models have improved extraction accuracy. However, these methods lack interpretability and provide limited insight into which linguistic structures cause extraction failures. Although some studies have explored dependency-based extraction of subject-verb-object triples and clauses, no principled analysis has examined which specific clause structures and dependencies lead to extraction difficulties. This study addresses this gap by analyzing how complex sentence structures, including relative clauses, adverbial clauses, coordination patterns, and passive constructions, affect the performance of rule-based atomic sentence extraction. Using the WikiSplit dataset, we implemented dependency-based extraction rules in spaCy, generated 100 gold=standard atomic sentence sets, and evaluated performance using ROUGE and BERTScore. The system achieved ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.6714, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.478, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.650, and BERTScore F1 = 0.5898, indicating moderate-to-high lexical, structural, and semantic alignment. Challenging structures included relative clauses, appositions, coordinated predicates, adverbial clauses, and passive constructions. Overall, rule-based extraction is reasonably accurate but sensitive to syntactic complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u590d\u6742\u53e5\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5bf9\u4ece\u53e5\u3001\u526f\u53e5\u3001\u5e76\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u8bed\u6001\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u53e5\u5f0f\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u53e5\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u63d0\u53d6\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u53e5\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528spaCy\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9WikiSplit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u4e86100\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u539f\u5b50\u53e5\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u91c7\u7528ROUGE\u548cBERTScore\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53e5\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728WikiSplit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.6714, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.478, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.650, \u548cBERTScore F1 = 0.5898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4ece\u53e5\u3001\u540c\u4f4d\u8bed\u3001\u5e76\u5217\u8c13\u8bed\u3001\u72b6\u8bed\u4ece\u53e5\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u8bed\u6001\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u53e5\u63d0\u53d6\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u53e5\u5b50\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u4ece\u53e5\u3001\u5e76\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u88ab\u52a8\u8bed\u6001\u65f6\u3002"}}

The issue shows up when the capacity is tight or the data spans several languages. Such collapse makes it difficult for downstream tasks to build on the resulting representation. Existing compression methods focus on aligning model outputs at a superficial level but fail to preserve the underlying manifold structure. This mismatch often leads to semantic drift in the compact model, causing both task behavior and linguistic properties to deviate from the reference model.\n  To address those issues, we provide a new framework called Embedding Consistency Regulation (ECR). This framework first derives a set of semantic anchors from teacher embeddings (computed once offline). Then, the compact model learns to maintain consistent geometry around these anchors, without relying on matching logits or internal features. ECR adds only a small projection step at inference, without altering the decoding architecture or its runtime behavior.\n  In experiments on a 100K multilingual corpus, ECR consistently stabilizes training and preserves semantic structure across tasks and languages. It also produces a more compact and task-aligned representation space, enabling low-capacity models to learn cleaner manifolds than conventional baselines. ECR works without teacher outputs and is compatible with, but independent of, distillation. Taken together, our results show that ECR helps compact models better follow task requirements and makes them easier to deploy under strict efficiency or privacy limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08ECR\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u6216\u6570\u636e\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u3002ECR\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u951a\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u3002", "motivation": "\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u6570\u636e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5e95\u5c42\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5c5e\u6027\u504f\u79bb\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "ECR\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u79bb\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u6b21\uff09\u4e2d\u6d3e\u751f\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5339\u914dlogits\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u951a\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002ECR\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728100K\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cECR\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u3002ECR\u65e0\u9700\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u5c80\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "conclusion": "ECR\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6216\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step. Experimental results on different reward settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8SDE\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684RL\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u4f4e\u71b5\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u7ec4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aE-GRPO\uff08\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0SDE\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u71b5\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e94\u7528ODE\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u7ec4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u5408\u5e76SDE\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5185\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684E-GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "E-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8SDE\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u71b5\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u7ec4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a lightweight and language-agnostic multilingual ASR system based on a CTC architecture with domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a Language-agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE (HLoRA) framework integrated into an mHuBERT-CTC model, enabling end-to-end decoding via LID-posterior-driven LoRA routing. The hierarchical design consists of a multilingual shared LoRA for learning language-invariant acoustic representations and language-specific LoRA experts for modeling language-dependent characteristics. The proposed routing mechanism removes the need for prior language identity information or explicit language labels during inference, achieving true language-agnostic decoding. Experiments on MSR-86K and the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge datasets demonstrate that HLoRA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art two-stage inference methods using only single-pass decoding, significantly improving decoding efficiency for low-resource mASR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08mASR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Whisper\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCTC\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578bmASR\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCTC\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u5206\u5c42LoRA-MoE\uff08HLoRA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230mHuBERT-CTC\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LID-\u540e\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684LoRA\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5171\u4eabLoRA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684LoRA\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u8bed\u8a00\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "HLoRA\u5728MSR-86K\u548cMLC-SLM 2025\u6311\u6218\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u7a0b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90mASR\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HLoRA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.\n  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf916\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5ea6\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001EBMs\u3001SR\u548cGOSDT\u7b49\uff09\u5728216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5ea6\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "EBMs\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u59cb\u7ec8\u5982\u4e00\u7684\u826f\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002SR\u548cIGANNs\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800cGOSDT\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5ea6\u8f83\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, efficiently creating new benchmarks to evaluate these capabilities remains a challenge. Traditional benchmark creation relies on manual human effort, a process that is both expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, existing benchmarks often contaminate LLM training data, necessitating novel and diverse benchmarks to accurately assess their genuine capabilities. This work introduces InfoSynth, a novel framework for automatically generating and evaluating reasoning benchmarks guided by information-theoretic principles. We propose metrics based on KL-divergence and entropy to quantify benchmark novelty and diversity without relying on costly model evaluations. Building on this framework, we develop an end-to-end pipeline that synthesizes robust Python coding problems from seed datasets using genetic algorithms and iterative code feedback. Our method generates accurate test cases and solutions to new problems 97% of the time, and the synthesized benchmarks consistently exhibit higher novelty and diversity compared to their seed datasets. Moreover, our algorithm provides a method for controlling the novelty/diversity and difficulty of generated problems.

We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFM\uff09\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aTSFM\u4f18\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\u3001OFT\u3001HRA\uff09\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660eTSFM\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFM\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9aa8\u5e72\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728AUC-PR\u548cVUS-PR\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\u3001OFT\u548cHRA\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFM\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u521d\u662f\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0cTSFM\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, real-world Chinese malicious queries typically conceal intent via homophones, pinyin, symbol-based splitting, and other Chinese-specific patterns. These Chinese-specific adversarial patterns create the safety evaluation gap that is not well captured by existing benchmarks focused on English. This gap is particularly concerning for lightweight models, which may be more vulnerable to such specific adversarial perturbations. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Chinese-Specific Safety Benchmark (CSSBench) that emphasizes these adversarial patterns and evaluates the safety of lightweight LLMs in Chinese. Our benchmark covers six domains that are common in real Chinese scenarios, including illegal activities and compliance, privacy leakage, health and medical misinformation, fraud and hate, adult content, and public and political safety, and organizes queries into multiple task types. We evaluate a set of popular lightweight LLMs and measure over-refusal behavior to assess safety-induced performance degradation. Our results show that the Chinese-specific adversarial pattern is a critical challenge for lightweight LLMs. This benchmark offers a comprehensive evaluation of LLM safety in Chinese, assisting robust deployments in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2d\u6587\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u4e25\u5cfb\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\u3002CSSBench \u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u4e2d\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u516d\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2d\u6587\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u82f1\u6587\u7684 LLM \u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e2d\u6587\u7279\u6709\u7684\u9690\u533f\u6076\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u8c10\u97f3\u3001\u62fc\u97f3\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u8bcd\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff08CSSBench\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u6587\u7279\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u975e\u6cd5\u6d3b\u52a8\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3001\u533b\u7597\u8bef\u5bfc\u3001\u8bc8\u9a97\u4ec7\u6068\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u653f\u52a1\u5b89\u5168\u516d\u5927\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u56e0\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u3002", "conclusion": "CSSBench \u4e3a\u4e2d\u6587\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our CCBMs, affirming their practical value in enabling dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CCBM\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5-\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6dfb\u52a0/\u5220\u9664\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CBM\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u7684CBM\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CCBM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5-\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6dfb\u52a0/\u5220\u9664\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86CCBM\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1CBM\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "CCBM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91CBM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TGE\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u79bb\u7ebf\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u8ddd\u751a\u8fdc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "TGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u7531\u79bb\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "TGE\u5728D4RL\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u64cd\u7eb5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TGE\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u89c6\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Such errors are particularly problematic in deterministic automation workflows, where inputs are fixed and correctness is unambiguous. We introduce a simple and model-agnostic framework that provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for reducing hallucinations in this setting.\n  We formalize the notion of a specific task, defined by a fixed input and a deterministic correctness criterion, and show that issuing the same prompt in independent context windows yields an exponential reduction in the probability that all model outputs are incorrect. To identify a correct answer among repeated runs, we incorporate an LLM-as-a-judge and prove that the probability that the judged pipeline fails decays at a rate determined by the judge's true- and false-positive probabilities. When the judge is imperfect, we strengthen it through majority vote over independent judge calls, obtaining ensemble-level error rates that decrease exponentially in the number of votes. This yields an explicit bound on the probability that the pipeline selects a hallucinated answer.\n  Experiments on controlled extraction tasks with synthetic noisy judges match these predictions exactly: pipeline failure decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, and hallucination-selection decreases exponentially with the number of judges in the ensemble.

While Softmax attention offers unbounded storage at prohibitive quadratic costs, linear variants provide efficiency but suffer from limited, fixed-size storage. We propose Fast-weight Product Key Memory (FwPKM), a novel architecture that resolves this tension by transforming the sparse Product Key Memory (PKM) from a static module into a dynamic, \"fast-weight\" episodic memory. Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets. Notably, in Needle in a Haystack evaluations, FwPKM generalizes to 128K-token contexts despite being trained on only 4K-token sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "FwPKM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u7684Product Key Memory\uff08PKM\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u201c\u5feb\u6743\u201d\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1aSoftmax attention\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u5927\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "FwPKM\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u7684Product Key Memory\uff08PKM\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u201c\u5feb\u6743\u201d\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u4e0ePKM\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cFwPKM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "FwPKM\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5145\u5f53\u4e86\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u201cNeedle in a Haystack\u201d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cFwPKM\u5728\u4ec5\u63a5\u53d74K\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230128K\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FwPKM\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called \"Twin Peaks\". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually.

When multiple output options are valid, the model's probability distribution is spread across them, which can misleadingly indicate low output quality. This issue is caused by two reasons: (1) LMs' final output activation is softmax, which does not allow multiple correct options to receive high probabilities simultaneuously and (2) LMs' training data is single, one-hot encoded references, indicating that there is only one correct option at each output step. We propose training a module for Quality Estimation on top of pre-trained LMs to address these limitations. The module, called Sigmoid Head, is an extra unembedding head with sigmoid activation to tackle the first limitation. To tackle the second limitation, during the negative sampling process to train the Sigmoid Head, we use a heuristic to avoid selecting potentially alternative correct tokens. Our Sigmoid Head is computationally efficient during training and inference. The probability from Sigmoid Head is notably better quality signal compared to the original softmax head.

We explore several LLM strategies like instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain of thought. Our results indicate underlying relationships within text aid LLMs in identifying precise text spans.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff08NER\uff09\u7b49\u663e\u5f0f\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\uff08ABSA\uff09\u7b49\u4e3b\u89c2\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5404\u79cdLLM\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eLLM\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6587\u672c\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While transformer-based NLP systems have improved registry workflows, their ability to generalize across jurisdictions with differing reporting conventions remains poorly understood. We present the first cross-provincial evaluation of adapting BCCRTron, a domain-adapted transformer model developed at the British Columbia Cancer Registry, alongside GatorTron, a biomedical transformer model, for cancer surveillance in Canada. Our training dataset consisted of approximately 104,000 and 22,000 de-identified pathology reports from the Newfoundland & Labrador Cancer Registry (NLCR) for Tier 1 (cancer vs. non-cancer) and Tier 2 (reportable vs. non-reportable) tasks, respectively. Both models were fine-tuned using complementary synoptic and diagnosis focused report section input pipelines. Across NLCR test sets, the adapted models maintained high performance, demonstrating transformers pretrained in one jurisdiction can be localized to another with modest fine-tuning. To improve sensitivity, we combined the two models using a conservative OR-ensemble achieving a Tier 1 recall of 0.99 and reduced missed cancers to 24, compared with 48 and 54 for the standalone models. For Tier 2, the ensemble achieved 0.99 recall and reduced missed reportable cancers to 33, compared with 54 and 46 for the individual models. These findings demonstrate that an ensemble combining complementary text representations substantially reduce missed cancers and improve error coverage in cancer-registry NLP. We implement a privacy-preserving workflow in which only model weights are shared between provinces, supporting interoperable NLP infrastructure and a future pan-Canadian foundation model for cancer pathology and registry workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u764c\u75c7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9BCCRTron\u548cGatorTron\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u7701\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9002\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u7ebd\u82ac\u5170\u548c\u62c9\u5e03\u62c9\u591a\u764c\u75c7\u767b\u8bb0\u5904\uff08NLCR\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2aOR\u5408\u594f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6f0f\u62a5\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u53e3\u764c\u75c7\u767b\u8bb0\u5904\u4f9d\u8d56\u75c5\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u764c\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62a5\u544a\u60ef\u4f8b\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5217\u98a0\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u7701\u764c\u75c7\u767b\u8bb0\u5904\u5f00\u53d1\u7684BCCRTron\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578bGatorTron\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u764c\u75c7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u7701\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebd\u82ac\u5170\u548c\u62c9\u5e03\u62c9\u591a\u764c\u75c7\u767b\u8bb0\u5904\uff08NLCR\uff09\u7ea6104,000\u4efd\u548c22,000\u4efd\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7ea7\uff08\u764c\u75c7\u4e0e\u975e\u764c\u75c7\uff09\u548c\u4e8c\u7ea7\uff08\u53ef\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u975e\u53ef\u62a5\u544a\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u627c\u8981\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2aOR\u5408\u594f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728NLCR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002OR\u5408\u594f\u6a21\u578b\u5728T1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.99\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u6f0f\u62a5\u764c\u75c7\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u523024\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a48\u4f8b\u548c54\u4f8b\u3002\u5728T2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5408\u594f\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.99\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u6f0f\u62a5\u53ef\u62a5\u544a\u764c\u75c7\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u523033\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a54\u4f8b\u548c46\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684NLP\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u767b\u8bb0\u7684NLP\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5408\u594f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6f0f\u62a5\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9519\u8bef\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u8de8\u7701\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u6cdb\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u7406\u548c\u767b\u8bb0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027NLP\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles.

It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate.

This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests.

Submitted for journal review", "summary": "Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b-\u6570\u636e\u5931\u914d\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7531\u798f\u514b-\u666e\u6717\u514b\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e93\u5c14\u5df4\u514b-\u83b1\u5e03\u52d2\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b-\u6570\u636e\u5931\u914d\u3002\u5c06\u5931\u914d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u71b5\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7531\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u9879\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u71b5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u71b5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u6bcf\u65e5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u514d\u8d39\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7d2f\u79ef\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b49\u5f85\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6709\u6548\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe95.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6Fiedler\u503c\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\uff08HFER\uff09\u3001\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u8c31\u71b5\u56db\u4e2a\u9891\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u5728\u6709\u6548\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08Cohen's d\u9ad8\u8fbe3.30\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523085.0%\u201395.6%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0Mistral-7B\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4eceHFER\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230 late-layer Smoothness\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u76d1\u63a7AI\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u54ea\u4e9b\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.\n  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests.

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Avatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5236\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 Talking head generation \u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Avatar Forcing \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5236\uff08diffusion forcing\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237-\u5934\u50cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08direct preference optimization\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u7684\u201c\u4e22\u5931\u201d\u6837\u672c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u7ea6 500 \u6beb\u79d2\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5feb 6.8 \u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7 80% \u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "Avatar Forcing \u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4f20\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency.

The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing.

We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u7ba1\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u9ad8\u5206\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff08DCR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002DCR\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u5b9a\u7406\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 LLM \u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u8be5\u5faa\u73af\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u94fe\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff08DCR\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3002STaR\u3001GRPO\u3001DPO\u3001\u71b5\u5956\u52b1\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u662f\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\u3002DCR\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1. \u591a\u6837\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4 STaR\u3001GRPO \u548c DPO \u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u30022. \u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u5d29\u6e83\u30023. \u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1. \u591a\u6837\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4 STaR\u3001GRPO \u548c DPO \u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u30023. \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u8ff0\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "DCR \u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a LLM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating \"average\" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u79bb\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709 Possession Value \u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4ec5\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u9632\u5b88\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08CDHMM\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u7403\u8fd9\u4e00\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7403\u5458\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u53d8\u76ef\u4eba\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u9632\u5b88\u5206\u914d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u79bb\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d21\u732e\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u9632\u5b88\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u79bb\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e Possession Value \u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4ec5\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u9632\u5b88\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9690\u9a6c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08CDHMM\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u7403\u8fd9\u4e00\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7403\u5458\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u53d8\u76ef\u4eba\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u9632\u5b88\u5206\u914d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u79bb\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08CDHMM\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u7403\u8fd9\u4e00\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7403\u5458\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u53d8\u76ef\u4eba\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u9632\u5b88\u5206\u914d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u79bb\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d21\u732e\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u9632\u5b88\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "We propose a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions that allows for efficient, training-free backpropagation, achieving competitive or improved optimization performance on benchmarks.", "motivation": "Existing gradient-based optimization methods for categorical variables suffer from high variance (score-function estimators) or bias (continuous relaxations).", "method": "We introduce a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions.
