Pre-print", "summary": "Natural-language user profiles have recently attracted attention not only for improved interpretability, but also for their potential to make recommender systems more steerable. By enabling direct editing, natural-language profiles allow users to explicitly articulate preferences that may be difficult to infer from past behavior. However, it remains unclear whether current natural-language-based recommendation methods can follow such steering commands. While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness. Finally, we offer practical design suggestions informed by our findings and discuss future steps in steerable recommender design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SteerEval\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 steerability\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u5230\u5185\u5bb9\u8b66\u544a\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u7684\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9 steerability \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 steerability \u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u663e\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8f91\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u6309\u7167\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c steering\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u53ef steerability \u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SteerEval \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece genres \u5230 content-warning \u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u753b\u50cf\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9 steerability \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u4e00\u7ec4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f17\u8bdd\u9898\u7684 steerability \u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u8def\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e steerability \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u4f17\u4e3b\u9898\u7684 steerability \u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u4f46\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9 steerability \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u7ec4\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SteerEval \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef steerable \u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u5e72\u9884\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute.

Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa DASH\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u52a8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 PLR \u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u518d\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 >3x \u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u5c06 LLM \u518d\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e >90%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 LHD \u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u4ee5\u6700\u7ec8\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6536\u655b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u9002\u914d\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DASH\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR) \u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u5f52\u6863\u4e13\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "DASH \u5c06\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc7 3 \u500d\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 baselines \u7684\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06 LLM \u7684\u518d\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc7 90%\u3002", "conclusion": "DASH \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684 LLM-\u9a71\u52a8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 PLR \u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eICLR\u3001NeurIPS\u3001ICML\u7684125k\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u540e\u5b9e\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff1b\u5168LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8bc4\u5206\u5b58\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65b9\u9762\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684META\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5728\u7b49\u5206\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0b\u66f4\u6613\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u4e3a\u82db\u523b\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u5236\u5b9aLLM\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u653f\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e125,000\u5bf9\u8bba\u6587-\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8de8ICLR\u3001NeurIPS\u3001ICML\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0e\u975eLLM\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u504f\u501a\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff08metareview\uff09\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u770b\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff1aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u4e3a\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff1b\u4f46\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u540e\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u666e\u904d\u66f4\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684LLM\u8bba\u6587\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u8f83\u5f31\u6295\u7a3f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8868\u89c2\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bbd\u5bb9\u5ea6\u3002\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65b9\u9762\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5728\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b49\u6548\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5206\u6570\u65f6\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u7ed9\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5219\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLMs\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bc4\u5206\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\\% Orders in Live-Streaming.

Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute.

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPDDL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3c PDDL \u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5728 DEL \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u8ff0 epistemic planning \u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5b8c\u6574 DEL \u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5b83\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e DEL \u7684 epistemic planning \u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5b50\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u62bd\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8868\u793a epistemic \u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa EPDDL \u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u4ee5 DEL \u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5e76\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u54ea\u4e9b DEL \u7684\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u5728 EPDDL \u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "EPDDL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u8fbe DEL \u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e DEL \u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b50\u788e\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a EPDDL \u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EPDDL \u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb epistemic planning \u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, emerging evidence shows that CDR can inadvertently heighten group-level unfairness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis to uncover why these fairness issues arise. Specifically, we identify two key challenges: (i) Cross-Domain Disparity Transfer, wherein existing group-level disparities in the source domain are systematically propagated to the target domain; and (ii) Unfairness from Cross-Domain Information Gain, where the benefits derived from cross-domain knowledge are unevenly allocated among distinct groups. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Domain Fairness Augmentation (CDFA) framework composed of two key components.

However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation.

However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u6c60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5171\u4eab continual learning \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u8def\u7531\u7a00\u758f\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u5229\u7528\u7d2f\u8ba1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5e38\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u6e90\u81ea\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u9694\u79bb\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u6c60\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fc3\u53d1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d2f\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u9891\u7e41\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e0e\u5fd8\u8bb0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5171\u4eab\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u95e8\u63a7\u8def\u7531\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions.

Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling.

We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u5747\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e13\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\uff1bQwen Coder 2.5 7B\u8fbe\u5230 92.7% Pass@1\uff08HumanEval\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 Qwen Coder \u4e0e DeepSeek Coder \u5728 2B \u4e0e 7B \u4e24\u4e2a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728 HumanEval\u3001MBPP\u3001CodeXGlue \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u95f4\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6 96% \u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u72ec\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728 Qwen Coder 2.5 7B \u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cHumanEval \u7684 Pass@1 \u8fbe\u5230 92.7%\uff08\u9ad8\u4e8e 90.9% \u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u542f\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\uff1b\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

This research measures the efficacy of detectors in identifying LLM-paraphrased fake news, in particular, determining whether adding a paraphrase step in the detection pipeline helps or impedes detection. This study contributes: (1) Detectors struggle to detect LLM-paraphrased fake news more than human-written text, (2) We find which models excel at which tasks (evading detection, paraphrasing to evade detection, and paraphrasing for semantic similarity). (3) Via LIME explanations, we discovered a possible reason for detection failures: sentiment shift.

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9LLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u683c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0ePPI\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u6765\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728LLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u9633\u6027\u7387\u548c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\uff08TPR/FPR\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u7684Type-I\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e0ePrediction-Powered Inference\uff08PPI\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u975e\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f53\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff1b\u5728Jigsaw Comment\u3001Hate Speech\u3001SafeRLHF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u63ed\u793aOracle Gap\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u566a\u58f0\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u529f\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faACQO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AQR\u548cRSF\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u591a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u5408\u5e76\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CRL\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5e38\u9700\u591a\u8def\u5e76\u884c\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0e\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06RL\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784(AQR)\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff1bRank-Score Fusion(RSF)\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(CRL)\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u7d22\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ACQO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5065\u57f9\u8bad\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u3002"}}

We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach.

EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models that have learned semantic relationships (e.g., that \"South Ozone Park\" is a neighborhood in \"New York City\" or that \"Lutte ouvriere\" refers to the Trotskyist \"Workers' Struggle\" party) from large text corpora. On benchmarks spanning city names, person names, organizations, multilingual political parties, and bibliographic records, EnsembleLink matches or exceeds methods requiring extensive labeling.

Extraction used a hybrid pipeline integrating direct text parsing, optical character recognition, and automated reconstruction. This ensures accuracy and clarity. Each record aligns a target word with its standardized Arabic definition and metadata that identifies the source domain. The dataset covers terms from linguistics, Islamic studies, mathematics, physics, psychology, and engineering. It supports computational linguistics and lexicographic research.

On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "OS-Search \u5c06 LLM \u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4 Z \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u5c42\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u9009\u53d6\u76ee\u6807 z*\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7 RL \u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u5750\u6807\u843d\u5728 z* \u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5e76\u884c\u904d\u5386\u4e0e\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u4ee4\u724c/\u7a0b\u5e8f\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u5728\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6587\u672c Z \u7684\u904d\u5386\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u8def\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08LLM \u8bc4\u5206\uff093.1 \u500d\uff1b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9 Z \u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5355\u6b65\u4ee4\u724c/\u7a0b\u5e8f\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u70b9\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4 Z \u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5728 Z \u4e2d\u9009\u53d6\u76ee\u6807 z*\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7 RL \u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5750\u6807\u843d\u5728 z* \u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u5b8c\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9 Z \u7684\u5e76\u884c\u904d\u5386\u4e0e\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6587\u672c Z \u7684\u904d\u5386\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9 Z \u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u672a\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6545\u4e8b\uff1a\u5bf9\u6587\u672c Z \u7684\u904d\u5386\u5e26\u6765 3.1 \u500d\u7684 LLM \u8bc4\u5206\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u8def\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\u5728\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9 Z \u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5bf9\u5916\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OS-Search \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u70b9\u5316\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u9010\u6b65\u4ee4\u724c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings.

In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process.

We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion.

As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with \"I don't know\" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining.

Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references.

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SHARP \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u753b\u50cf\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u4f24\u5bb3\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u654f\u611f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f24\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 bias\u3001fairness\u3001ethics\u3001epistemic reliability \u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5931\u6548\u4ee5\u53ef\u76f8\u52a0\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bf9\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0cCVaR95 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30 11 \u79cd\u524d\u6cbf LLM \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684 901 \u6761\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4fbf\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u76f8\u5dee>2\u500d\uff1b\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1abias \u5c3e\u90e8\u6700\u5f3a\uff0cepistemic \u4e0e fairness \u5904\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0cethics \u5c3e\u90e8\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6807\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%.

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) \u4e0e Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5065\u58ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u7b97\u672f\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u901a\u8fc795\u4efd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6587A\u80a1\u5e74\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b Taxonomy \u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0cQwen3-235B \u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u672f\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b Taxonomy\uff08\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3001\u6620\u5c04\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u5355\u5143\uff09\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6/\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u7ea0\u7684 Python \u6c99\u7bb1\u6267\u884c\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CCB \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684 Chain-of-Thought \u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f Qwen3-235B \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece 59.7% \u63d0\u5347\u81f3 67.3%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u8fd110\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u9700\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u8f6c\u5199\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0 CDL\uff0c\u7531\u72ec\u7acb\u7684 MLLM \u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u73b0\u6709 LLM \u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 CoT \u589e\u5f3a\u7684 SFT \u4e0e GRPO\u3001CDL \u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u7ea6 5.5k \u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5f00\u6e90/\u95ed\u6e90 MLLMs \u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u539f\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5199\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08CDL\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u8ba9\u5f3a\u5927 LLM \u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a MLLM \u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5c06\u53ef\u89c6\u56fe\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0 CDL\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684 LLM \u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9009\u62e9 CDL \u4f5c\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u683c\u5f0f\u56e0\u5176\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u6709\u8fde\u9501\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408 GRPO \u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u4ee5 CDL \u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u9898\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347 CDL \u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6784\u5efa Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5728 Formalgeo7k v2 \u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u6dfb CoT \u6ce8\u91ca\uff09\u3002\u5728 Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\u3001Unigeo\u3001MathVista \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6 5.5k \u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90/\u95ed\u6e90 MLLMs \u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9 PGPS \u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5199\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u6765\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5927 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5199\u4e3a CDL \u5e76\u7531 LLM \u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8 PGPS \u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff1bCoT-\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 SFT \u4e0e CDL \u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9 CDL \u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u52a8\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e5f\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices.

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality.

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa TACO\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u201c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u201d\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763NCO\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u6216\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763NCO\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u9762\u5411\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u4e0e\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5404\u81ea\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u6cdb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6 TACO\uff08Test-time Adaptation for CO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u653e\u677e\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684 inductive bias\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u4e0e\u4ece\u5934\u5fae\u8c03\u6cdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTACO \u5728\u89e3\u8cea\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u9876\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a TACO \u5728\u591a\u79cdCO\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cdb\u5316-\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5f02\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763NCO\u8303\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6865\u6881\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO \u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763NCO \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684CO\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations.

Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection).

However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research.

However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \\method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems.

Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa TIDE\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5c9b\u5c7f\u6a21\u578b\u7684 Tree Similarity Edit Distance\u3001\u5185\u90e8 LLM \u903b\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u53d8\u5f02\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e UCB \u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u8d28\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\u3001\u5e38\u91cf\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684 premature convergence \u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u5e76\u884c\u5c9b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7 Tree Similarity Edit Distance \u9a71\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5c06 LLM \u751f\u6210\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u53d8\u5f02\u7b97\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e UCB \u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u9ad8\u4ea7\u51fa\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cTIDE \u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u534f\u540c\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term \"HYDRA\" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems).

We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations.

However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "ME-POIs combine text-based POI embeddings with large-scale mobility signals to learn function-based POI representations, using temporally contextualized visit embeddings and contrastive alignment, plus multi-scale spatial propagation to mitigate data sparsity.

The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks.

Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon.

However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa EHR-RAG\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5927\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u9879\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747 Macro-F1 \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 10.76%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 LLM \u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316 EHR \u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 LLM \u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5\u622a\u65ad\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b EHR \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e27\u5931\u91cd\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u7eb5\u5411\u75c5\u5386\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5927\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u4e8b\u4ef6-\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408EHR\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u5c55\u8bc1\u636e\u8986\u76d6\uff1b3) \u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e/\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u9879\u957f\u65f6\u7a0bEHR\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEHR-RAG \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747 Macro-F1 \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 10.76%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316EHR\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u7eb5\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency.

To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence.

However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks.

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary.

While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality.

Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical \"reasoning horizon gap\": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search.

However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa TACLer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u201c\u601d\u8003/\u4e0d\u601d\u8003\u201d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bf9\u7167\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5927\u91cfRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a (1) \u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u8fdb\uff1b(2) \u6df7\u5408\u5f0f Thinking/NoThinking \u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u542f\u6216\u5173\u95ed Thinking \u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e >50%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6 token \u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e >42%\uff1b\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347 >9%\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e SOTA \u7684 NoThinking \u4e0e Thinking \u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f RL \u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

We propose a flow-matching-based \\textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \\textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \\textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6d41\u5f0f/\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4 refinement \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6270\u52a8\u539f\u59cb ODE \u8def\u5f84\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff1b\u5728 MNIST \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 1-NFE \u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6700\u4f18 FID 1.46\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 CIFAR-10\u3001FFHQ-256x256 \u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u6b63\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u6216\u591a\u6b65\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684 Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)\u3002\u9636\u6bb51 \u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u9006\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u9636\u6bb52 \u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684 refinement\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb ODE \u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u591a\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff081-NFE\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u3001FFHQ 256x256 \u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff1aFID \u4ece 3.95 \u63d0\u5347\u81f3 1.46\uff08MNIST\uff0c1-NFE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "BFR \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4fee\u6539\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.\n  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5904\u7406\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00/\u4ee3\u7801\u7b49\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u7f51\u9875\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5148\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6027/\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u5f97\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u5f00\u59cb\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "1) \u4ee5\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982 Dyck \u62ec\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728 Needle-in-a-haystack \u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2) \u5c06\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6700\u5927\u7ea6 1.3B \u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u7f6e\u4ec5 0.1% \u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08C4\u3001CodeParrot\u3001DeepMind-Math \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b3) \u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e MLP \u5c42\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\uff1b4) \u63a2\u8ba8\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728 Needle-in-a-haystack \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDyck \u5e8f\u5217\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece 10% \u63d0\u5347\u5230 98%\uff1b\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u524d\u7f6e 0.1% \u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u8fbe\u5230\u7b49\u540c\u635f\u5931\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u53ef\u51cf\u81f3\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684 55-86%\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e MLP \u5c42\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u8f83\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5c06\u6765\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "CE-GOCD \u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u8bba\u6587\u6807\u9898\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5b50\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u5bf9\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a LLM \u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22-\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a NLP \u6587\u732e QA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u6563\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5757\u6216\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8bba\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u8bba\u6587\u6807\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u951a\u70b9\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b3) \u5e94\u7528\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u5171\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u7fa4\u7ec4\uff1b4) \u5c06\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u5bf9 LLM \u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a NLP \u6587\u732e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cCE-GOCD \u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8bba\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cCE-GOCD \u80fd\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy.

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish \"do X\" from \"do not X\" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7b80\u8981\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u201c\u5e94\u4e0d\u201d\u8fdb\u884c\u5426\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u5f80\u5f80\u5c06\u7981\u6b62\u884c\u4e3a\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u5141\u8bb8\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5426\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u597d\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5065\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa NSI \u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5206\u7ea7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u5206\u201c\u505aX\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u4e0d\u8981\u505aX\u201d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u969c\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5bf916\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u572814\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0e\u590d\u5408\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u503e\u5411\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u7981\u6b62\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e3a77%\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u5408\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4e3a100%\uff0c\u6bd4\u80af\u5b9a\u53d9\u8ff0\u9ad8\u51fa317%\u3002\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u51b5\u8f83\u597d\u4f46\u4ecd\u670919%-128%\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b\u80af\u5b9a prompts \u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u602774%\uff0c\u5426\u5b9a prompts \u964d\u81f362%\uff1b\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u6bd4\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u7ed3\u8bba\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa Negation Sensitivity Index NSI \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7ea7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u81ea\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \\emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \\textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \\emph{sparse observations} and \\emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss.

We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation.

This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion.

However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords.

To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models.

This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\u03bb\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.042$).

Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios.

Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\\% and 50\\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues.

However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.\n  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.\n  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.\n  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GPT-2\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u90e8\u5206GPT-2\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42Transformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u540e\u7684LayerNorm\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-IV Note\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u548c\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u63d0\u53ca/\u5426\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3EHR\u4e2d\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u961f\u5217\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u532e\u4e4f\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668/\u81ea\u56de\u5f52GPT-2\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2aTransformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u7ec8LayerNorm\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCheXpert\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u672a\u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u6587\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e/\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b/\u805a\u5408\u75be\u75c5\u7ed3\u5c40\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5728MIMIC-IV-Note radiology reports\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u63d0\u53ca\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9eEHR\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668PG-TMT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5de5\u51b5\u3001\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5de5\u51b5\u3001\u901f\u5ea6/\u8d1f\u8f7d/\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u57df\u79fb\u4f4d\u3001\u548c\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u65e9\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e14\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPG-TMT\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5e72\u5e72\u830e\uff08stem\uff09\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u77ac\u6001\uff1bTiny-Mamba\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u957f\u7a0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5c40\u90e8Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u5171\u632f\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u65f6\u57df\u5230\u8c31\u57df\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c31\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u9636\u5e26\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba(EVT)\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u9608\u503c\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u6291\u5236\u6296\u52a8\uff1b\u5728 leakage-free streaming protocol \u4e0a\u5bf9CWRU/\u5e15\u5fb7\u535a\u6069/\u897f\u5b89\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66-\u5f90\u5dde\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a pilot \u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0cPG-TMT\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e-\u53ec\u56deAUC\u3001\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684ROC AUC\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u540c\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u53d1\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0eEVT\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u8026\u5408\uff0cPG-TMT\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset.

Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL.

Pan"], "title": "Chain Of Thought Compression: A Theoritical Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9690\u5f0fCoT\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOrder-r Interaction\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u65b9\u5f0f\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNatBool-DAG\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u538b\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u6377\u5f84\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faALiCoT\uff08Aligned Implicit CoT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aALiCoT\u5b9e\u73b054.4x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4eChain-of-Thought\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f0fCoT\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Order-r Interaction\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1NatBool-DAG\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5254\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u6377\u5f84\uff1b\u63d0\u51faALiCoT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\uff1bNatBool-DAG\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff1bALiCoT\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b054.4x\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9690\u5f0fCoT\u53ef\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53cc\u91cd\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens.

Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \\textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \\textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6 TGCC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee5\u53ca\u8c31\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1/\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u539f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e25\u683c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a1) \u5728\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2) \u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u56fe\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 FinReport \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTGCC \u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe 13.41%\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230 5/6 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u2011\u827a\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "TGCC \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1/\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u4f18\u826f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \\underline{A}c\\underline{t}ive Latent \\underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Yet, in sub-billion-parameter small language models (SLMs), embedding matrices dominate the parameter budget. This work argues that this allocation is as suboptimal as it is counterintuitive. Leviathan is an architecture with a continuous embedding generator to replace the discrete lookup tables of canonical models.

In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods.

However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones.

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets.

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages.

Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as \"optical memory.\" We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u53bb\u566a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u62bd\u6837\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u5fc3\u533a\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u6cdb\u5316\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u665a\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u91cd\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6 memorization\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6539\u52a8\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u89e3\u91ca\u8bb0\u5fc6\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u4ece\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u63a7\u5236", "method": "\u63ed\u793a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u5404\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u504f\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u63a7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u540e\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u53bb\u566a\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u6cdb\u5316\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027"}}

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models.

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models.

Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6 TCAP\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u8fc7\u6ee4 Poisoned \u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684 FTaaS \u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u8de8\u89e6\u53d1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bFTaaS \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u98ce\u9669\u9700\u8981\u901a\u7528\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6620\u5c04\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e EM \u7684\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u6765\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd MLLM \u67b6\u6784\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0cTCAP \u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TCAP \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a MLLMs \u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9 Attention-FFN \u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784 AFD \u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728 r A-1 F \u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18 A/F \u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5316\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u8bef\u5dee\u5728 10% \u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 AFD \u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7eb5\u6a2a\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6548\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u5e73\u7a33 Attention \u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684 FFN \u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728 rA-1F \u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc A/F \u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6821\u51c6\u7684 AFD \u4eff\u771f\u5668\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18 A/F \u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u6700\u4f18\u53ea\u76f8\u5dee ~10%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 AFD \u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 Attention-FFN \u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u541e\u5410\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency.

To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge.

Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa FedGALA \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50 GNN \u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684 PLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u591a\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u7ea614.37%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3 PLMs \u4e0e GNN \u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50 GNN \u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684 PLMs \u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c PLMs\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cFedGALA \u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u7ea614.37%\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FedGALA \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe-\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields.

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa DA-SPS \u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff08TVPS\uff09\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff08EVPS\uff09\u3002TVPS \u4f7f\u7528 SSA \u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7 LSTM \u4e0e\u91c7\u7528\u4fee\u8865\u7b56\u7565\u7684 P-Conv-LSTM \u63d0\u53d6\u6df1\u5c42\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u3002EVPS \u901a\u8fc7 Spearman \u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7528 L-Attention\uff08\u7531 LSTM \u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u6210\uff09\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06 TVPS \u4e0e EVPS \u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6c42\u548c\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4e3b\u677f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9879\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DA-SPS \u4e3a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\u5e76\u884c\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u5730\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format.

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios.

However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e0bx\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u4e8e\u03b5/v\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7k-Diff\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570k\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4f1a\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u03b5\u3001v\u3001x\u7b49\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fak-Diff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684k\u4ee5\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bba\u8bc1\u5728ambient\u7ef4\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5927\u4e8eintrinsic\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6x\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0ck-Diff\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u4f73\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u603b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u7b49\u5173\u952e KPI \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd0\u8425\u5bfc\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u666e\u904d\u4ee5\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u79bb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u8fd0\u8425\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a (i) \u9762\u5411\u5907\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b (ii) \u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b (iii) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u8425 KPI\uff08\u5982\u603b\u6210\u672c\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e KPI \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u63d0\u70bc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u65f6\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\uff1b\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u672c\u2013\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u8861\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5e93\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u94fe\u8def\u843d\u5730\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u8425\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\\times$ and KV cache by $R\\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\\% and decoding speedups up to 117\\% on long sequences.

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Gray-Wyner\u98ce\u683c\u4e09\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u635f\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u4efb\u52a1\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5ffd\u7565\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u3002Gray-Wyner\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u79bb\u5171\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e09\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206 disentangle \u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u635f\u5171\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u517c\u987e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516d\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u516d\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c06Gray-Wyner\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6Gray-Wyner\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u4e09\u901a\u9053\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u635f\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization.

Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\\% and 4.63\\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Two-stage cognitively-inspired post-training: CoMT learns abstract strategies; CCRL optimizes task adaptation with confidence-aware intermediate rewards, yielding better generalization and higher efficiency.", "motivation": "Current post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution.

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SAGE\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 OneRec \u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u8868\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e GBPO \u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9762\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u9501\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6784\u5efa\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3 OneRec \u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SAGE\uff1a1) \u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6d88\u9664 token \u7ea7\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3 Reward Collapse\uff1b2) \u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9879\u4f7f\u7528 Boost Factor \u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 Entropy Aware Penalty \u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e SAGE \u80fd\u89e3\u9501\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e GBPO \u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSAGE \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u9501\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6216\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u5177\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u6709 GBPO \u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE \u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5217\u8868\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u6e90 LLM \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u6784\u5efa\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \\method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "L^3 \u5c06\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e token \u7684\u8def\u7531\u805a\u5408\u4e00\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7684\u652f\u6491\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684 MoE\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u8def\u7531\u7684 Mixture-of-Experts\uff08MoE\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5929\u7136\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Large Lookup Layer (L^3)\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u3002L^3 \u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001 token-based \u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a token \u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e CPU \u79bb\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\uff1b(2) \u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8fbe 2.6B \u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cL^3 \u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684 Iso-sparse MoE\u3002", "conclusion": "L^3 \u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u662f\u5bf9 MoE \u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al.

A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6309 token \u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684 undesired capabilities\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1btoken \u8fc7\u6ee4\u6bd4\u6587\u6863\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff08\u5982\u5bf9 forget \u57df\u7684 7000x \u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u3002\u5728 token \u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6807\u6ce8 token \u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728 forget \u57df\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u826f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6613\u88ab\u5bf9\u624b\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5851\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0e token \u5c42\u7ea7\u4e24\u79cd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u826f\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5c06\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u201cforget\u201d\u57df\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9 token \u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u7b7e\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u5ec9\u4ef7\u4f46\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548 token \u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6548\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "token \u7ea7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u6536\u76ca\u4e0b\u5bf9 benign \u80fd\u529b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u5728\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9 forget \u57df\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u964d\u8fbe\u5230 7000 \u500d\uff1b\u7ecf\u8fc7 token \u8fc7\u6ee4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728 forget \u57df\u4ecd\u53ef\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 token \u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7 token \u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9 undesired capabilities \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u6bd4\u6587\u6863\u8fc7\u6ee4\u66f4\u5177\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8 token \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Application to sparse precision matrix estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\uff08BCD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u51f8\u590d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5305\u542b\u53d8\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u8fd1\u7aef\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u56fe\u5f62Lasso\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08Graphical ISTA\u3001Primal GLasso\u3001QUIC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ca\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe100\u500d\uff09\u3002\u201c", "motivation": "\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1BCD\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6709\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08Graphical Lasso\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u7684\u975e\u51f8/\u534a\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684BCD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u67d0\u79cd\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u53d8\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6/\u8fd1\u7aef\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u56fe\u5f62Lasso\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u51f8\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u81f31/100\u5de6\u53f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u591a\u79cdGraphical Lasso\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u975e\u51f8\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeR2 \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6c99\u7bb1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\u6587\u732e\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u6b63\u65b0\u9896\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd regime\uff08Instruction-only\u3001 Concepts\u3001 Related-only\u3001 Full-set\uff09\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u8bc1\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6587\u732e\u5e93\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u6267\u884c\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 end-to-end \u7684 RAG \u8bc4\u4f30\u5f80\u5f80\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u6df7\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u7455\u75b5\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u7f51\u9875\u6ce2\u52a8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u65b0\u9896\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u56db\u79cd regime\uff1aInstruction-only\u3001 Concepts\uff08\u4ec5\u91d1\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u65e0\u6587\u732e\uff09\u3001 Related-only\uff08\u4ec5\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff09\u3001 Full-set\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e+\u9876\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u5e72\u6270\u9879\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u53c2\u6570\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08\u9700\u5728\u65e0\u8bc1\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u89e3\u9898\uff09\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u6587\u732e\u5e93\uff082023-2025 \u7406\u8bba\u8bba\u6587\uff09\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca validated rationales\u3002\u4e0e\u4f60\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8bef\u7528\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5934\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\uff08headroom\uff09\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728 Full-set \u4e0b\u53cd\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982 Instruction-only\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6216\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u547d\u540d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4e3a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6027\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u8bef\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "DeR2 \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u7981\u6b62\u53c2\u6570\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6587\u732e\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences.

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states.

Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8d85\u8d8a_lang_space\u89e3\u7801\uff08\u5982\u675f\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7801\u5ffd\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u6570\u503c\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff08Bayes-optimal\uff09\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u4ee5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u5404\u4e2a\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5e76\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7801\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u675f\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea7\u8054\u4f20\u9012\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Cascaded Transfer Learning\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u6309\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e refinement\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u9012\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u4f20\u9012\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ea7\u8054\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u548c refinement \u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea7\u8054\u4f20\u9012\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5728\u53d7\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4f20\u9012\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability).

Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas.

Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9 SPD \u77e9\u9635\u5728 Riemannian \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u3002\u63d0\u51fa BWSPD \u7684 sqrt(\u03ba) \u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e Log-Euclidean\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684 BN-Embed \u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u674e\u7fa4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u4e14 BWSPD \u4fdd\u8ddd\u6027\u6709 bi-Lipschitz \u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u540c\u4e00 Transformer \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4 BWSPD\u3001Log-Euclidean \u4e0e Euclidean \u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728 1500+ \u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cLog-Euclidean Transformer \u5728\u4e09\u7c7b EEG \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cBWSPD \u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a SPD \u77e9\u9635\u5d4c\u5165\u5728 Riemannian \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u3001\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u9610\u660e\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e09\u6761\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7 Daleckii-Krein \u77e9\u9635\u63a8\u5bfc BWSPD \u5177\u6709 sqrt(\u03ba) \u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4 Log-Euclidean \u7684 \u03ba\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\uff08d\u226522\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u4f4e\u7ef4\uff08d\u22648\uff09\u65f6\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u5f00\u9500\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff1b2) \u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4 BN\uff08BN-Embed\uff09\u5728 Riemannian \u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9644\u8fd1\u5177\u6709 O(\u03b5^2) \u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u5728 56\u901a\u9053 ERP \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a +26% \u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u5728 8\u901a\u9053 SSVEP \u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5f71\u54cd\u751a\u5fae\uff1b3) \u53cc Lipschitz \u8fb9\u754c\u8bc1\u660e BWSPD \u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u5f62\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5931\u771f\u4ec5\u53d7 \u03ba \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 Transformer \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b EEG \u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u3001ERP\u3001SSVEP; 36 \u4f4d\u88ab\u8bd5\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7 1500 \u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\uff09\u5bf9 BWSPD\u3001Log-Euclidean\u3001Euclidean \u4e09\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\uff0cLog-Euclidean Transformer \u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art \u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf Riemannian \u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684 SPD \u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bBWSPD \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002BN-Embed \u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14 Log-Euclidean \u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86 SPD \u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 Log-Euclidean \u5d4c\u5165\u5728 EEG \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca BWSPD \u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6d41\u5f62\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\uff1bBN-Embed \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u901a\u9053\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5728 SPD \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa VERSA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8db3\u7403\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1 VAEP \u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 Bepro \u63d0\u4f9b\u7684 K League 1\uff082024 \u8d5b\u5b63\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 18.81% \u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6e90\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u5728 K League 1\uff082024\uff0cBepro \u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8de8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u7ecf\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9 VAEP \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0 18.81% \u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u7ecf VERSA \u4fee\u6b63\u540e\uff0c\u8de8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5bf9 VAEP \u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8db3\u7403\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Reset-and-Discard (ReD) \u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u6210\u672c\uff08coverage@cost\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e pass@k \u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7 ReD \u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5728\u6709/\u65e0 pass@k \u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u8282\u7701\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6570\u53ca\u63a8\u65ad\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c HumanEval \u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56 pass@k\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7531\u4e8e pass@k \u5e38\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u968f\u6210\u672c\u589e\u957f\u5448\u73b0\u9012\u51cf\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u5e42\u5f8b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Reset-and-Discard (ReD) \u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6216\u4e22\u5f03\u65e0\u5173\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f pass@k\u5f62\u5f0f\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a pass@k \u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4f7f\u7528 ReD \u7684\u8282\u7701\u7684\u603b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6570\uff1b\u82e5\u65e0 pass@k\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a LLM \u4e0a\u57fa\u4e8e HumanEval \u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReD \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe\u5230\u671f\u671b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3001tokens \u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5e42\u5f8b\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReD \u4e3a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701\u4e0e\u5e42\u5f8b\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data.

In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold.

However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation.

First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ee5\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53cc\u5411\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u65cf\u5bb9\u91cf\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0b\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u6761\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u8868\u793a\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u5145\u5206\u4f46\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u62fc\u63a5\uff08stitching\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u53cc\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u660e\u91cd\u5efa\u3001CKA\u3001RSA\u7b49\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3) \u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u65cf\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b4) \u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5411\u4e0b\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u8f83\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u884d\u751f\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b5) \u5c06\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u666e\u9002\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u8bba\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u5f0f\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u62fc\u63a5\u5177\u6709\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u53cc\u5411\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u91cd\u5efa\u3001CKA\u3001RSA\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5145\u5206\u6027\u4f46\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\uff0c\u82e5\u5728\u9ad8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5219\u5728\u4f4e\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee3\u8868\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9/\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible.

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM.

Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u8d1f\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u662f\u9057\u5fd8\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u6210\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCollaborative Neural Learning (CNL)\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u5df2\u638c\u63e1\u96c6\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5185\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u96f6\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f3a\u8d1f\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4 forgetting\uff1b\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u4e3a\u51b2\u7a81\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0850%-75%\uff09\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0825%-50%\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u51b2\u7a81\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3001\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5c0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387eta\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u638c\u63e1\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aLLMs\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCNL\u5728\u5c31\u5730\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea659.1%-81.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCORDS\uff1a\u5c06\u53ef\u53d8\u5927\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u96c6\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u573a\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u56de\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u57fa\u6570\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u586b\u5145\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5c06\u96c6\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\uff1a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u573a\u627f\u8f7d\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u57df\u4e0a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u573a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u53ef\u9006\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5927\u503c\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u53d8\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing.

While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme.

Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP is inversely proportional to $\u03b4$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on R\u00e9nyi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $\u03b5$, where R\u00e9nyi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains.

Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa representation holonomy\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd gauge \u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c0f\u73af\u73af\u8def\u4e0a\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u7684\u201c\u626d\u66f2\u201d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4ec5\u770b\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982 CKA\u3001SVCCA\uff09\u5173\u6ce8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8868\u793a\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u9f50\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49 holonomy \u4e3a\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u73af\u5e73\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u540e\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u201c\u626d\u66f2\u201d\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40 whitening \u56fa\u5b9a\u91cf\u7eb2\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u4ec5\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684 Procrustes \u5bf9\u90bb\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5d4c\u56de\u5230\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u6b63\u4ea4\u548c\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\uff08post-whitening\uff09\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u5c04\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u96f6\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u5c0f\u534a\u5f84\u65f6 holonomy \u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) holonomy \u968f\u73af\u534a\u5f84\u589e\u5927\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff1b2) \u80fd\u5c06\u5728 CKA \u4e0b\u770b\u4f3c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u6765\uff1b3) \u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8150\u8680\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5448\u76f8\u5173\uff1b4) \u80fd\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "representation holonomy \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u5916\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\uff08IPS\uff09\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7ea7\u522b\u6a21\u6001\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5f15\u5165 IPS-GRPO \u4f5c\u4e3a GRPO \u7684\u65e0\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u7684\u7ec8\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5f80\u5f80\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u574d\u584c\u81f3\u5c11\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4ec5\u51ed\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u968f\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u6307\u6570\u5206\u5316\u5e76\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u81ea\u671f\u671b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e58\u5b50\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9891\u7387\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec8\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u539f\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) \u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u4fee\u6539 IPS-GRPO\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u3002", "result": "IPS-GRPO \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed3\u679c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u52a3\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea0\u6b63\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u589e\u52a0\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cIPS-GRPO \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7ed3\u679c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations.\n  For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \\emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \\emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}.

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.\n  We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.\n  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \\textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$.

Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u6216\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65e2\u4f4e\u6548\u53c8\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6ce8\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0815\u5206\u949f\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff: predicting a future state adds bias, but conditioning the inverse dynamics model (IDM) on that prediction can greatly reduce variance, yielding lower error and better sample efficiency than behavior cloning (BC) under suitable state-predictor bias.

For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wishart\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0b\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u9644\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7684DP\uff1b\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u5219\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5e76\u975eDP\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6210\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u566avariant\u540e\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u80dc\u8fc7\u4ec5\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u628aLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8868\u660eLoRA\u672c\u8eab\u5e76\u975e\u5929\u751f\u79c1\u6709\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u5177\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6838\u7b97\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u6240\u9700\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Wishart\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4e0d\u6dfb\u52a0\u663e\u5f0f\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u7684DP\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eLoRA\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684DP\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u7531\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u8d1f\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\uff1b\u5c06LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u5f52\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u9690\u79c1\u542b\u4e49\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6838\u7b97\u5bf9\u5b9e\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5411\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u65e0\u9644\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1DP\uff1b\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u4e0dDP\u5e76\u51fa\u73b0\u9ad8AUC\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5927/\u5c0f\u79e9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u7eaf\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff1bLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8868\u660eLoRA\u672c\u8eab\u5e76\u975e\u81ea\u5e26\u79c1\u6709\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u5177\u9690\u79c1\u6027\uff1b\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8ba1\u91cf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cWishart\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5411\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684DP\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u8f93\u51fa\u5219\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\uff1bLoRA\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u793a\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6838\u7b97\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This opacity hinders their use in downstream tasks, such as surrogate-based optimization, that require explicit covariance models. We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 PFN \u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6838\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Bochner \u5b9a\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "motivation": "PFN \u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u644a\u9500\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c/\u6838\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684 PFN \u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u7406\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d attention \u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c06 PFN \u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 Bochner \u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u5f97\u5230\u5e73\u7a33\u6838\uff1b\u5728\u5355-realization \u4e0e\u591a-realization \u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8c31 identifiability \u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u6709\u591a\u4efd\u51fd\u6570\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u591a\u5cf0\u8c31\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u6838\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e PFN \u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5cf0\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e GP \u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6838\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e PFN \u548c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528 PFN \u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8c31\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u6838\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures.

This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy.

In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to \"flatten\" the data.

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa KVW\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5411\u91cf\u524a\u5f31\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 LVLM \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0e\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5fd8\u8bb0\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u88ab\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u524a\u5f31\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u4e14\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MLLMU \u548c CLEAR \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0-\u4fdd\u7559\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u8f83\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u548c LoRA \u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "KVW \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-free \u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 LVLM \u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.\n  Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3.", "code_url": "https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3", "code_stars": 2, "code_last_update": "2026-01-30", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u540e\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe(DAG)\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faDASH\uff08Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Descending Q-Tile Iteration\u548cShift Scheduling\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728NVIDIA H800\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.28\u00d7\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u5982FlashAttention-3\u7b49\u5728\u540e\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u4e3a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u9700\u8981\u4e32\u884c\u5316\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u89c4\u7ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u548c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u540e\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe(DAG)\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51faDASH\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) Descending Q-Tile Iteration\uff08\u964d\u5e8fQ\u5757\u904d\u5386\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u904d\u5386\u67e5\u8be2\u5757\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\uff1b2) Shift Scheduling\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u5efaDAG\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u963b\u585e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5728NVIDIA H800\u00b7GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u65f6\uff0cDASH\u7684\u540e\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe1.28\u00d7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u540e\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aDAG\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u7c7b\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u5728GitHub\u83b7\u53d6\uff1ahttps://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3", "conclusion": "DASH\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u540e\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill.

Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u5143\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5143\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u89c4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u7ea6\u675f\u5143RL\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u878d\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c refined \u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0b\u754c\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7d27\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565 refinement \u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0a\u754c\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0\u8981\u70b9\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b56\u7565 refinement \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u662f\u7d27\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u5143RL\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u60c5\u5f62\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.\n  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.\n  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise.

Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware.

The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality-scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality.

Panousis", "Diego Marcos"], "title": "Clarity: The Flexibility-Interpretability Trade-Off in Sparsity-aware Concept Bottleneck Models", "comment": null, "summary": "The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to \"induce interpretability\". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations.

Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAUM\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u7597\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5c06\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u963f\u52d2\u6258\u91cc\u514b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u6d4b\u5728MIMIC-IV\u4e0eeICU\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62.2% AUC-ROC\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e14\u91c7\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u7b49\u4e14\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u963f\u52d2\u6258\u91cc\u514b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u60a3\u8005-\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bf9\u53ef\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u606f\u88ab\u52a0\u6743\u5f3a\u8c03\uff0c\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u5929\u7136\u5f97\u5230\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0aAUC-ROC\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62.26%\uff0c\u5728eICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62.17%\uff1b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AUM\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u4ee5 ImageNet \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 InceptionV3 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u65f6\uff0cFID \u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b dropout \u4f30\u8ba1 FID \u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc4\u4f30 FID \u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "FID \u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9 FID \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 FID \u53ca\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b dropout \u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4 ImageNet1K \u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7528\u4f5c FID \u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u6307\u793a\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56 FID \u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9 FID \u53ca\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3 FID \u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM).

However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently.

Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches.

Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL.

This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap.

Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\\textbf{R}$ea$\\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize.

Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios.

Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance.

Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668 CLReg\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u201c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7279\u5f81\u201d\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u201c\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5f81\u201d\u4e2d\u63a8\u5f00\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\u548c\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5fd8\u8bb0\u2014\u4fdd\u7559\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5c42\u9762\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7559\u4e0b\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u75d5\u8ff9\u5e76\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u9690\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u88ab\u5f7b\u5e95\u79fb\u9664\u3002\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u72b6\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CLReg\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7279\u5f81\u8fdc\u79bb\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5fd8\u8bb0-\u4fdd\u7559\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u76ee\u7684\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u964d\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\u4e0a\uff0cCLReg \u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5fd8\u8bb0-\u4fdd\u7559\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u672a\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u5f62\u72b6\u5316\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u964d\u4f4e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5851\u9020\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u79fb\u9664\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI.

A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments.

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings.

However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence.
