### [1] [Quantum NLP models on Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15972)
*Ling Sun,Peter Sullivan,Michael Martin,Yun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Quantum NLP models for NLI can match classical baselines with far fewer parameters, and exhibit dramatically higher per-parameter learning efficiency in few-shot settings. A new Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP) metric is proposed, along with a cluster-based parameter-sharing architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of quantum natural language processing (QNLP) on natural language inference (NLI) in low-resource, few-shot scenarios, quantify learning dynamics with a dedicated metric, and explore design strategies to improve generalization.

Method: Utilize the lambeq library and the DisCoCat framework to construct parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs. Train models for semantic relatedness and inference classification. Compare quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer baselines under constrained few-shot settings. Introduce Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP) as a metric for learning efficiency. Propose a cluster-based architecture that ties gate parameters to learned word clusters to promote parameter sharing and circuit isolation.

Result: Quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while using dramatically fewer parameters. They outperform randomly initialized transformers on inference tasks and exhibit lower test error on relatedness tasks. The per-parameter learning efficiency is significantly higher, reported up to five orders of magnitude compared to classical counterparts. A cluster-based architecture that ties gate parameters to word clusters improves generalization by reducing circuit isolation and enabling parameter sharing.

Conclusion: QNLP with parameter-efficient quantum circuits shows promise for low-resource, structure-sensitive NLP tasks like NLI. Learning efficiency can be substantially improved through cluster-based parameter sharing, suggesting fruitful directions for future research in quantum-assisted language understanding.

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

*Md Kamrul Siam,Md Jobair Hossain Faruk,Jerry Q. Cheng,Huanying Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个基于两大语言模型（ChatGPT 与 Claude）的多模型融合框架，以提升 CheXpert 数据集上胸部X线影像解读的可靠性。通过单模态图像评估、基于输出相似度的共识融合，以及用合成临床笔记的多模态评估，显著提升诊断准确性，尤其在共识融合下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高 AI 辅助放射诊断的可信度和临床实用性，解决单模态不足与模型输出不一致的问题，利用模态间互补性与输出级共识来降低诊断错误，同时保持低额外计算开销。

Method: 1) 使用 CheXpert 全量数据集中的 234 例 radiologist 标注样本，进行图像单模态提示的 unimodal 评估，得到 ChatGPT 62.8%、Claude 76.9% 的诊断准确率，并使用 95% 的输出相似度阈值进行相似度共识，准确率提升至 77.6%。2) 生成基于 MIMIC-CXR 模板的合成临床笔记，挑选 50 例进行图像+文本的多模态评估，结果为 ChatGPT 84%、Claude 76%，共识准确率达到 91.3%。3) 对比不同设置，发现输出级共识融合在两种实验条件下均优于任一单模态模型。

Result: 单模态：ChatGPT 62.8%，Claude 76.9%；共识（图像单模态且 95% 相似度阈值）：77.6%；多模态：ChatGPT 84%，Claude 76%；共识（多模态）：91.3%；总体观察：通过输出级共识和跨模态信息整合，显著提升诊断准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 输出层面的跨模型共识与多模态融合能提升 AI 辅助放射诊断的可信度与临床实用性，提供一种低计算开销的实用路径来降低诊断错误。

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

### [3] [Can LLMs Correct Themselves? A Benchmark of Self-Correction in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16062)
*Guiyao Tie,Zenghui Yuan,Zeli Zhao,Chaoran Hu,Tianhe Gu,Ruihang Zhang,Sizhe Zhang,Junran Wu,Xiaoyue Tu,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Lixing Chen,Pan Zhou,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 CorrectBench 基准来评估自纠策略在大语言模型中的有效性，覆盖内生、外部和微调自纠，涉及常识推理、数学推理和代码生成三大任务；结果显示自纠在复杂推理中有提升，但会带来效率下降，简单的链式思维基线也具备竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自纠方法尚未被系统性、全面地评估，且关于模型是否真的能自我纠错并提升推理能力存在争议。本研究通过一个统一基准来量化自纠效果与成本，探索不同自纠策略的协同效应与权衡。

Method: 提出 CorrectBench 基准，评估三类自纠策略（intrinsic/internal、external/external、fine-tuned/微调）在 commonsense、mathematical、code generation 三类任务上的效果，并与简单的 chain-of-thought（CoT）基线比较；在不同模型（如 DeepSeek-R1）上进行实验，考察混合策略的收益与时间成本。

Result: 自纠方法能提升复杂推理任务的准确率；混合不同自纠策略可进一步提升性能，但会降低效率；面向推理的模型在额外自纠下优化有限且时间成本高；相比之下，简单的 CoT 基线在准确性和效率上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 自纠对提升推理性能具有潜力，但效率仍是关键挑战。未来研究应聚焦于在推理能力与运营成本之间取得更好的权衡，并探索在实际场景中组合不同自纠策略的最佳做法。

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,
we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between
reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:

### [4] [EvolveR: Self-Evolving LLM Agents through an Experience-Driven Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16079)
*Rong Wu,Xiaoman Wang,Jianbiao Mei,Pinlong Cai,Daocheng Fu,Cheng Yang,Licheng Wen,Xuemeng Yang,Yufan Shen,Yuxin Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes EvolveR, a closed-loop framework enabling LLM agents to self-improve by offline distilling interaction trajectories into reusable strategic principles and online use of these principles to guide decision-making, with a policy reinforcement loop; demonstrated gains on multi-hop QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents with tool use lack the ability to learn iteratively from their own experiences. Existing work focuses on external knowledge gaps and does not address self-guided strategy refinement or autonomous improvement through self-generated experiences.

Method: Offline Self-Distillation: synthesize interaction trajectories into a structured repository of abstract strategies; Online Interaction: retrieve distilled principles to guide decisions; Policy reinforcement: iteratively update the agent based on performance; Closed-loop lifecycle enabling continuous improvement.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, achieving superior performance over strong agentic baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn from the consequences of their actions, enabling more autonomous and continuously improving systems; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

### [5] [Evaluating Prompting Strategies and Large Language Models in Systematic Literature Review Screening: Relevance and Task-Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16091)
*Binglan Han,Anuradha Mathrani,Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对六种大型语言模型在五种提示类型下用于系统综述筛选阶段的交互效应进行对比评估，结果显示结构化提示在低成本模型上可实现良好F1，建议采用分阶段工作流，将低成本模型用于初筛，边界案例再由高容量模型处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统综述(SLR)的文献筛选是耗时环节，本文旨在量化提示策略与LLM在筛选任务中的交互作用、比较不同模型的成本-性能，并提供可操作的部署指南。

Method: 评估六种LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、DeepSeek-Chat-V3、Gemini-2.5-Flash、Claude-3.5-Haiku、Llama-4-Maverick）在五种提示类型（零-shot、少量-shot、链式推理CoT、CoT-少量-shot、自我反思）对六项Level-2任务中的相关性分类进行评估，指标为准确率、精确率、召回率、F1；并对每千条摘要进行成本-性能分析，最后给出工作流建议。

Result: 结果显示：CoT-少量-shot在精确性-召回率之间提供最稳定的平衡；零-shot在高敏感性筛查时可最大化召回；自我反思因过于包容性及跨模型不稳定而表现较差；GPT-4o与DeepSeek表现稳健，GPT-4o-mini性价比高；不同模型-提示组合的成本差异显著；在每千条摘要的成本-性能分析中，GPT-4o-mini在多种提示下保持低成本，结构化提示（CoT/CoT-少量-shot）在GPT-4o-mini上也可获得较高F1。

Conclusion: LLMs在文献筛选中的潜力虽有差异但值得期待，本文通过系统地分析提示-模型交互，提供基准和任务自适应部署的实践指引。建议采用分阶段工作流：先使用低成本模型结合结构化提示进行初筛，边界案例再升级到更大容量模型进行处理。

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

### [6] [Facts in Stats: Impacts of Pretraining Diversity on Language Model Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16096)
*Tina Behnia,Puneesh Deora,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一个灵活的合成测试平台，将统计性文本流与抽象事实对流相结合，通过可控的上下文结构与事实多样性，研究ID和OOD情境下的事实泛化，以及嵌入/解嵌层的瓶颈；提供用于未来研究的受控实验环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统分析语言模型在统计规律与事实关联交互中的泛化能力，弥补现有工作在多样性和上下文结构对泛化影响方面缺乏系统、可控分析的不足；需要独立控制上下文结构和事实多样性以揭示不同泛化指标的影响。

Method: 构建一个双通道的合成框架：一个统计性文本流、一个抽象的事实源-目标对流；通过调整流组成、事实在两条流中的出现方式、以及训练时长，来独立控制上下文结构与多样性；在模型组件上进行干预实验，追踪OOD失败的根源，聚焦嵌入层与解嵌层。

Result: 提高上下文多样性会延迟ID的事实准确性；OOD泛化对上下文结构的依赖在不同设置中差异显著，有时与ID趋势一致，有时需要多样性才能实现非平凡的事实回忆；最优多样性水平随训练时长变化；存在独立于事实回忆的统计泛化失败结构，且嵌入/解嵌瓶颈是OOD失败的关键来源；提供一个可控测试平台以分离在大规模研究中可能被混淆的效应。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于在不依赖大规模实验的情况下分离影响因素，为未来研究提供受控的测试环境，并指向嵌入与解嵌层在泛化中的关键作用。

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次对 GenAI/LLMs 的信任与不信任进行大规模、纵向的计算分析，基于 2022–2025 年 Reddit 数据，揭示信任与不信任几乎持平、随重要模型发布而波动，技术表现和可用性为主导维度，个人经验为最常见原因，并揭示不同信任者之间的差异，提出可扩展的信任分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要将心理学/人机互动研究与大规模数据分析结合，弥合定性洞察与定量、可扩展的测量工具，帮助治理机构与企业实现负责任的 GenAI 部署。

Method: 使用多年的 Reddit 数据（2022–2025，39 个子 Reddit、197,618 条帖子），对代表性样本进行众包标注，然后训练分类模型以实现规模化分析；分析随时间的信任/不信任信号，并考察信任者类型的差异。

Result: 信任与不信任长期基本持平；在主要模型版本发布前后出现波动；技术性能和可用性是主导维度，个人体验是 shaping 态度的最常见原因；不同信任者（专家、伦理学者、一般用户）呈现不同模式。

Conclusion: 为大规模信任分析提供方法论框架，并对公众对 GenAI 的演化认知提供见解，具有治理与政策、产品设计的指向意义。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

TL;DR: 提出EgMM-Corpus：面向埃及文化的多模态数据集（约3,000张图像、313个概念），用于评估/训练vision-language模型，并通过对CLIP的零-shot评估揭示文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在中东和非洲地区缺乏多模态、具有文化真实性的数据集的问题，提供埃及文化的可靠基准数据集，促进文化感知的模型发展。

Method: 设计并执行新的数据收集管线，收集3,000张图像，覆盖313个概念（地标、食物、民俗），并对每条目进行人工验证的文化真实性与多模态一致性；在EgMM-Corpus上评估CLIP的零-shot分类性能。

Result: CLIP在该数据集上的零-shotTop-1为21.2%，Top-5为36.4%；结果显示大型V-L模型存在文化偏见，同时证明EgMM-Corpus可作为评估/训练文化敏感模型的基准。

Conclusion: EgMM-Corpus为埃及文化相关的视觉语言模型提供可靠资源，促进在埃及及类似文化背景中的模型开发与评估。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

*Jennifer Hu,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox,Siyuan Song,Kyle Mahowald,Roger P. Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一个理论框架将语法、意义与语言模型的字符串概率联系起来；在英语/中文的28万句对上验证，发现模型概率与最小对中的语义差异相关、模型-人类差异相关性显著，同时在概率空间对语法/非语法的区分能力有限；为以概率评估LM语法提供理论基础，并指向未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于语言模型学到了什么样的语法知识存在争议；概率与句法性是不同概念，需要理论框架来理解概率信息对语法知识的指示力；通过简单的生成过程假设与最小语义差异的句对来预测可观测现象。

Method: 提出一个关于语法、含义与语料概率的简单生成过程框架，推导出三条可检验的预测；在包含英语和中文的28万句对数据集上进行验证；通过分析最小对、模型与人类的差异在最小对中的相关性，以及有无区分能力来检测概率信息与语法知识的关系。

Result: 验证了三条预测：1) 最小对内字符串概率的相关性；2) 模型与人类在最小对中的差异相关性；3) 语法与非语法字符串在概率空间中的区分性较差。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用概率来推断LM的结构性知识提供理论基础，并指向未来在LM语法评估上的研究方向。

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出在低资源设定下通过 pluralistic decoding 与模型引导实现语言模型的多元价值对齐，实验显示在高风险任务中减少假阳性并改善人类价值分布的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在社会领域的影响扩大，单一最佳答案的训练假设导致缺乏对多元价值和微妙语义的反映，需要在资源受限情境下实现多元化对齐。

Method: 提出两种方法：pluralistic decoding（多元解码）和 model steering（模型引导），并在只需约50个标注样本的情形下比较它们的效果。

Result: 模型引导在零-shot和少-shot基线下表现出一致的改进；在 hate speech detection、 misinformation detection 等高风险任务中降低误报率；并提升 GlobalOpinionQA 的人类价值分布对齐。

Conclusion: 强调多样性在对齐中的重要性，以及通过解码与模型引导相结合的策略，促进语言模型更准确地反映不同人群的价值取向。

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

*Zhichao Xu,Shengyao Zhuang,Xueguang Ma,Bingsen Chen,Yijun Tian,Fengran Mo,Jie Cao,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文对比了基于提示的查询扩增与基于强化学习的查询改写在信息检索中的效果，发现简单的提示型方法在强大LLMs下常常与RL方法相当甚至更优；提出On-policy伪文档查询扩增（OPQE）作为混合方法，进一步提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，LLMs驱动的查询扩增有两大主流方向：基于提示的生成新查询或伪文档，以及通过强化学习微调以优化检索指标。但在一致实验条件下，两者的对比尚不清晰。本文旨在在统一条件下系统比较两种方法，并探索是否存在更优的混合策略。

Method: 在多种基准数据集（证据检索、无偏/ad hoc、工具检索）上进行系统比较，评估基于提示的查询扩增（生成答案或伪文档作为新查询）与RL微调的查询改写。进一步提出On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE)：让策略学习生成最大化检索性能的伪文档，同时结合提示的灵活性与RL的目标导向。实现并提供代码以便复现。

Result: 实验表明，在强大LLMs条件下，简单的、无需训练的查询扩增往往与或优于RL方法；OPQE在提示和RL两者之上，表现最佳，超越单独的提示或RL改写，展示了混合策略的优势。

Conclusion: 对IR中的查询扩增而言，训练无须成本的提示性方法已具备竞争力；将提示与RL的优势结合的混合方法（如OPQE）可取得更佳性能，提示与RL的协同具有显著潜力，值得进一步研究并已实现可复现性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

*Pratham Singla,Shivank Garg,Ayush Singh,Ishan Garg,Ketan Suhaas Saichandran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过对比SFT、DPO、GRPO的后训练模型，RL训练的模型在对所学策略的意识与跨域泛化方面优于SFT，但在推理过程与最终输出之间的对齐普遍较弱，GRPO尤为显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究后训练技术是否提升模型对自身学习到的潜在策略的认知、对策略的跨领域泛化能力，以及内部推理轨迹与最终输出的一致性，并比较不同后训练策略的影响。

Method: 设计若干任务，要求模型学习并应用不同策略；对照评估模型在三项核心能力（对所学策略的意识、跨域泛化、推理-输出对齐）上的表现；比较SFT、DPO、GRPO三种后训练方式的模型。

Result: RL训练的模型在意识到所学行为及对新结构相似任务的泛化方面优于SFT模型，但推理轨迹与最终输出之间的对齐普遍较弱，其中GRPO训练模型的对齐问题最突出。

Conclusion: 后训练中的强化学习策略提升了对已学策略的意识与跨域泛化能力，但内部推理与输出之间的对齐仍存在显著不足，需在未来研究中提升对齐机制，尤以GRPO情形为甚。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

### [13] [Utilising Large Language Models for Generating Effective Counter Arguments to Anti-Vaccine Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16359)
*Utsav Dhanuka,Soham Poddar,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are used to generate counter-arguments to vaccine misinformation; combines prompting strategies, fine-tuning, and multi-label classification to tailor rebuttals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health misinformation on social media demands real-time, context-aware debunking to improve immunisation uptake and trust in health recommendations.

Method: Experiment with prompting strategies and fine-tuning to generate counter-arguments; train a multi-label classifier to categorize anti-vaccine tweets (efficacy concerns, side effects, political influences); evaluate via human judgments, LLM-based assessments, and automatic metrics.

Result: Label-informed prompts and structured fine-tuning yield stronger, more coherent counter-arguments; high cross-method alignment; potential for scalable misinformation mitigation.

Conclusion: Integrating label descriptions with structured fine-tuning enhances the effectiveness of counter-arguments and offers a scalable approach to mitigating vaccine misinformation.

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,
and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our
evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

### [14] [Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17354)
*Chenghao Zhang,Guanting Dong,Xinyu Yang,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified mixed-modal retrieval-augmented generation framework Nyx for URAG, with a four-stage NyxQA dataset construction and a two-stage training pipeline, achieving strong performance on both text-only RAG benchmarks and the general URAG vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world information needs often involve mixed modalities (text and images). Existing RAG focuses on unimodal text; there is a need for a universal, cross-modal retrieval and reasoning system that can improve vision-language generation. Data scarcity for mixed-modal retrieval is a key bottleneck, motivating synthetic data construction and alignment with generative preferences.

Method: Nyx is a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever designed for URAG. It introduces a four-stage automated pipeline to generate and filter web-based data to form NyxQA, a diverse mixed-modal QA dataset. Training is two-staged: (1) pre-training on NyxQA plus various open-source retrieval datasets; (2) supervised fine-tuning with feedback from downstream vision-language models to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences.

Result: Nyx achieves competitive performance on standard text-only RAG benchmarks and excels in URAG, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Nyx demonstrates strong generalization to mixed-modal retrieval and generation, offering a practical URAG solution and dataset that better reflect real-world information needs across text and images.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

### [15] [End-to-End Argument Mining through Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16363)
*Nilmadhab Das,Vishal Vaibhav,Yash Sunil Choudhary,V. Vijaya Saradhi,Ashish Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AASP jointly formulates argumentative structure prediction as an autoregressive process over a constrained action set, using a conditional language model to build ACs/ARs step-by-step, achieving state-of-the-art results on AM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty of modeling dependencies among argumentative components and relations, and to move beyond flattened generative formulations by proposing an end-to-end autoregressive approach.

Method: Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework that defines a constrained set of actions to build the argumentative structure step-by-step under a conditional pre-trained language model, enabling end-to-end joint modeling of AM tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on two AM benchmarks and strong results on a third, across all AM tasks.

Conclusion: An end-to-end autoregressive framework with constrained actions effectively captures argumentative flow and dependencies, improving AM performance and offering a unified approach across tasks.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

*Federico Ravenda,Seyed Ali Bahrainian,Andrea Raballo,Antonietta Mira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种轻量级的干预方法：在特定层的激活上应用线性变换，利用 steer 向量引导输出，对大模型在心理健康领域的适应进行成本极低的微调，提升在两类任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面临的挑战是小规模模型在领域特定任务（如心理健康评估）上表现不足，亟需不依赖大计算成本的适配方法，以便在敏感、高影响力领域获得可用的AI工具。

Method: 在模型的某一层激活上应用线性变换，借助 steer 向量引导模型输出。这是一种轻量、计算成本低的方法，不涉及微调权重的复杂训练。

Result: 在两个任务上均有改善：1) 识别 Reddit 帖子是否有助于检测抑郁症状（相关性预测）；2) 基于用户的 Reddit 帖子历史完成一个标准化的抑郁症问卷（问卷完成任务）。该方法证明了 steering 机制作为高效的领域适配工具在 MH 领域的潜力。

Conclusion: 表明 steering 机制是对大模型进行心理健康领域高效适配的有希望的工具，能够在不进行高成本计算的前提下提升小尺度模型的任务性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoReBench 与 MoReBench-Theory 提供面向过程的道德推理评测集，揭示通用推理基准无法预测模型的道德推理能力，并暴露对特定伦理框架的偏好，研究对安全与透明的AI有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI在道德决策中的推理过程，而不仅仅是给出结果。通过可见的思考轨迹与大量情境/准则，评估模型如何识别道德要点、权衡取舍并给出可操作建议，从而提升AI的可解释性和安全性。

Method: 1) MoReBench：1000个道德情景，每个情景配有专家认为应包含（或避免）的准则，共计包含超2.3万条准则，涵盖识别道德因素、权衡取舍、给出可操作建议等，覆盖人-AI合作和自主道德决策。2) MoReBench-Theory：150个示例，测试AI在五大规范伦理框架下的推理。

Result: 结果显示，扩展性规律和现有数学/代码/科学推理基准无法预测模型在道德推理上的能力；模型对特定道德框架存在偏好（如康德式义务论与边沁式功利主义），这可能是常见训练范式的副作用。两套基准共同推动对过程性推理的评估，朝着更安全、透明的AI迈进。

Conclusion: 该工作为过程性道德推理评估提供了大规模、有结构的基准集，揭示了当前通用推理基准的局限性及潜在偏向，促进对AI推理过程的审查与改进，从而提升AI的安全性与可解释性。

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

*Fu-An Chao,Bi-Cheng Yan,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用 Whisper 作为 frozen 基础模型，从隐藏表示中提取声学与语言特征，用轻量分类器在顶层实现 L2 SLA；在 GEPT 图像描述数据集上超越先进基线，且图像和文本提示信息可进一步提升；嵌入本质编码了序列化能力和语义层面，显示无需微调也具备 SLA 潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 Whisper 在二语口语评估中的潜在能力，不仅限于转录结果，而是挖掘其隐藏表示中的声学与语言特征，用于评估语言能力。

Method: 在 Whisper 的中间层与输出上训练一个轻量级分类器；结合图像与文本提示信息作为辅助相关线索；对 Whisper 的嵌入进行深入分析，评估其是否在不进行任务微调的情况下编码序数性与语义信息。

Result: 在 GEPT 图像描述数据集上实现强于现有基线的表现，甚至优于多模态方法；引入图像与文本提示后，性能进一步提升；对嵌入的分析显示 Whisper 自身编码了序数能力和语义层面的信息，无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: Whisper 可作为 SLA 与其他口语理解任务的强大基础，在不微调的前提下即能体现对语言能力的编码能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

*Syed Rifat Raiyan,Md Farhan Ishmam,Abdullah Al Imran,Mohammad Ali Moni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrugalPrompt 提出一种基于显著性剪枝的提示压缩框架，通过 GlobEnc 与 DecompX 为输入中的每个标记分配显著性分数，保留前 k% 的标记以原有顺序构建稀疏提示，从而在一定程度上降低提示长度、成本与延迟，同时评估对情感分析、常识问答、摘要和数学推理等任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型对长上下文的高成本（金钱、碳排放、推理延迟），探索在多任务场景下上下文稀疏对性能的容忍度与边界，揭示哪些任务可在较高压缩下保持性能。

Method: 结合两种标记归因方法 GlobEnc 与 DecompX 对输入序列的每个标记进行显著性打分，排序并保留 top-k% 的标记，保持原有顺序以得到稀疏的 frugalized prompt；在 Sentiment Analysis、Commonsense QA、Summarization、Mathematical Reasoning 四个任务及多种前沿 LLM 上进行评估；对比 top-k%、bottom-k%、random-k% 的表现以分析任务容忍度与潜在的训练数据记忆效应。

Result: 在前三个任务上，约 20% 的提示压缩带来仅有边际的性能损失，表明当前 LLM 能从高显著性线索中重建省略的上下文；在数学推理任务上，性能显著下降，显示该任务对完整上下文的连续性依赖更强；对 bottom-k% 与 random-k% 的分析揭示不对称的性能模式，可能与任务污染效应和对记忆化模式的依赖有关。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于更细致地理解提示稀疏对不同任务的容忍度与边界，为高效推理与成本优化场景提供参考，同时给出一个可复现的实验框架与源码仓库以评估上下文压缩的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

*Bin Yu,Xinming Wang,Shijie Lian,Haotian Li,Changti Wu,Ruina Hu,Bailing Wang,Yuliang Wei,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrajSelector 提出一个高效的 Best-of-N 框架，通过在采样语言模型（LLM）的隐藏状态中进行步级轨迹评分，并由一个 0.6B 参数的轻量化校验器对轨迹进行评估，最终聚合分数选出最佳轨迹。与多数投票和传统的过程奖励模型相比，尽管成本更低，仍在五个基准上实现稳定提升，Best-of-32 的准确率提升分别为约 4.61% 与 4.31%-12.21%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决外部 Best-of-N TTS 中对过程奖励模型的高计算成本，以及对 LLM 内在隐表示的低利用率，提出在采样阶段就利用隐藏状态进行轨迹评分，并用小型校验器端到端训练的方案，减少对逐步标注的依赖。

Method: 在采样 LLM 的隐藏状态中提取对过程级别的评分信号；引入一个仅 0.6B 参数的轻量级 verifier 对逐步轨迹的质量进行评估，再对分数进行聚合以选取最优轨迹；采用全数据驱动的端到端训练，不依赖大规模逐步标注；在 Best-of-N（尤其 Best-of-32）场景中进行评估。

Result: 在五个基准上体现出稳定的性能提升：与多数投票相比，准确率提升 4.61%；比现有过程奖励模型提升 4.31% 至 12.21%，且总体推理成本更低。

Conclusion: TrajSelector 作为一个高效且有效的 Best-of-N 框架，利用采样 LLM 的隐藏表征与轻量校验器，实现对轨迹的高质量评估与选择，降低对大型过程奖励模型的依赖，并在多项基准上显示出一致的性能改进与成本优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Conclusion: RAVEN为广告违规检测提供了一种端到端、可部署且鲁棒的解决方案，证明了通过渐进式学习和强化学习驱动的跨模态推理可提升实际系统性能与可泛化性。

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 通过 LiTEx 对两份英语 NLI 数据集的解释性标注进行对比分析，发现标签不一致时仍可能存在高度相似的解释，强调以推理类型的共识来衡量语义相似性；揭示解释策略的个体偏好和选择偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解 NLI 数据中的人类标注变异及其对评估和数据质量的影响，尤其是解释性标注如何揭示潜在的一致性与偏差。

Method: 将 LiTEx 分类法应用到两份英语 NLI 数据集，综合比较标签一致性、解释相似性和分类一致性，并考虑 annotators 的选择偏差。

Result: 在某些情形下，标签上存在分歧，但解释高度相似；解释策略与标签选择呈现个体偏好；在推理类型的一致性方面，解释层面的共识比标签一致性更能反映解释文本的语义相似性。

Conclusion: 强调解释性分析对理解标注过程的重要性，提示不要把标签视为 ground truth；在评估和数据质量控制中需考虑推理类型的一致性与解释多样性，以及如何结合解释信息改进数据标注与模型评估。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

Conclusion: 首个基于LLM的缺陷评审检测系统，为AI治理提供证据，并在探讨人机协作以维护学术诚信方面提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

### [24] [Language over Content: Tracing Cultural Understanding in Multilingual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16565)
*Seungho Cho,Changgeon Ko,Eui Jun Hwang,Junmyeong Lee,Huije Lee,Jong C. Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过比较在不同国家和语言设置下对“语义等价问题”的激活路径重叠，探索大语言模型对文化理解的内部机制。结果显示存在强烈的语言相关模式，同语言跨国的内部路径重叠度高于跨语言同国的情况；韩国-朝鲜对在重叠度低且变异性高，提示语言相似并不保证内部表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估多聚焦输出层性能，难以揭示驱动回答差异的内部机制；以往的电路分析覆盖语言有限且很少聚焦文化，因此需要在多语言和文化维度上揭示内部表示的形成与差异。

Method: 通过测量在语义等价的问题下回答时的激活路径重叠，设计两组对比条件：一是改变目标国家而固定语言；二是改变问题语言而固定国家。同时使用同一语言但跨国家的配对来将语言与文化分离。分析激活路径的重叠程度以揭示语言与文化对内部表示的影响。

Result: 同语言跨国的问题中内部路径的重叠度高于跨语言同国的问题，表明存在显著的语言特定模式。特别是韩朝配对表现出低重叠度与高变异性，说明语言相近并不保证内部表示的一致性。

Conclusion: 内部表征受语言与文化的交互影响所驱动，单纯的语言相似性不足以预测内部激活模式的一致性。该研究强调在多语言多文化背景下对LLMs的内部机制进行更细粒度的分析与评估的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

*Alkis Koudounas,Moreno La Quatra,Manuel Giollo,Sabato Marco Siniscalchi,Elena Baralis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 SHALLOW：一个首个系统性分类与量化 ASR 语音幻觉现象的基准框架，按词汇、音位、形态和语义四条轴定义指标，给出可解释的模型行为轮廓。其与 WER 相关性在高质量识别时较强，在较高错误率时减弱，能发掘 WER 无法捕捉的细粒度错误模式，辅助诊断与改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估多数基于错误率，难以区分声学输入与幻觉输出，且对在关键领域的可用性构成隐性风险。因此需要一个能识别和量化“幻觉倾向”的评估框架，以引导模型改进。

Method: 提出 SHALLOW 基准框架，围绕词汇、音位、形态与语义四个互补维度设计专门指标，构建可解释的模型行为画像；在多种模型架构与多领域语音数据上进行评估。

Result: SHALLOW 指标在识别质量较高（低 WER）时与 WER 存在较强相关性；当 WER 增加时相关性显著减弱；框架能够揭示比 WER 更细粒度的错误模式，提供超越汇总错误率的诊断信息。

Conclusion: SHALLOW 提供一种可诊断、可诊断优化方向的评估工具，帮助定位模型薄弱环节并给出改进反馈，适用于多架构与多领域语音数据的评估。

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

TL;DR: 面向乌尔都语的AI生成文本检测框架：构建对照数据集并微调多语言Transformer模型，达到SOTA级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补乌尔都语AI文本检测工具稀缺的问题，帮助防止错误信息与学术不端，推动低资源语言的NLP发展。

Method: 构建1800个人类文本与1800条AI生成文本的平衡数据集，来源模型包括Gemini、GPT-4o-mini、Kimi AI；进行语言特征分析（字符/词统计、词汇丰富度Type-Token Ratio、N-gram等），使用t检验和Mann–Whitney U测试评估显著性；对mdeberta-v3-base、distilbert-base-multilingual-cased、xlm-roberta-base三种模型进行微调，最佳为mDeBERTa-v3-base。

Result: mDeBERTa-v3-base在测试集上实现F1=91.29、准确率=91.26%，并完成了对统计特征的显著性分析，证明该框架在乌尔都语AI文本检测方面具备较强效能。

Conclusion: 有望提升乌尔都语及其他低资源语言的AI文本检测能力，助力打击虚假信息与学术不端。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest
performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set.
This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic
misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader
development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

*Yiyang Liu,James C. Liang,Heng Fan,Wenhao Yang,Yiming Cui,Xiaotian Han,Lifu Huang,Dongfang Liu,Qifan Wang,Cheng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种 Capsule Prompt-Tuning CaPT，通过单一胶囊提示整合实例语义与任务信息，采用“注意力锚点”将实例信息放在序列首位，在几乎无参数增量的情况下提升提示微调性能，同时保持极高的参数效率；在多任务上表现优越，例如在 T5-Large 上达到 84.03% 的平均准确率，且在 Llama3.2-1B 上仅用极小比例参数（0.003%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示式学习依赖大量网格搜索来确定提示长度，并需要多轮提示，成本高且难以扩展；且缺少实例级信息，导致对输入序列的注意力互动有限，难以充分利用实例信息来提升模型表现。

Method: 提出 CaPT：单胶囊提示，融合实例感知与任务感知信息，几乎无额外参数负担。通过在输入序列的最前端加入实例相关标记，形成“注意力锚点”，促进对结构信息的保留及对所有输入标记的更活跃的注意力交互，从而实现近乎参数无增量的提示微调。

Result: 在多任务评估中，CaPT 展现出优于 baselines 的性能，并实现极高的参数效率，例如在 Llama3.2-1B 上仅使用极小比例的参数；在 T5-Large 上达到约 84.03% 的平均准确率等表述性结果。

Conclusion: CaPT 提供了一种高效且有效的近乎无参数的提示微调方法，通过结合实例信息和任务信息以及注意力锚点策略，提升了提示式学习的性能与效率。

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

### [29] [Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685)
*Damin Zhang,Julia Rayz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 TUuD 框架，用以评估大型语言模型在 deictic t-FoR 下对时间-事件关系的理解与推理；结果显示四个模型在“现在”附近表现出时间认知的适应性，但对距离较远的时间点适应减弱，表明其时序推理受参照系与时间距离影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间理解对人类认知至关重要，时间常通过感官-运动经验的空间隐喻来表达；LLMs 在时间推理方面能力有限，需评估在“现在”位置动态变化时的时间理解能力。

Method: 提出 TUuD 框架，令 LLMs 评估从“现在”到目标事件的时间相似度（0.00–1.00），以 deictic t-FoR 为参照点；在一个时间轴上移动“现在”并对事件进行相似度判定；在四个 LLMs 上进行实验，分析相似度随时间距离与参照点变化的模式。

Result: 四个模型表现出可量化的对 deictic t-FoR 的适应性，相似度在近距离“现在”处达到峰值，随时间向过去/未来滑移而下降；近中期以后的适应性显著减弱。

Conclusion: LLMs 具备一定的人类式时间认知的成分，但其时序推理对参照点移位和时间距离敏感，需改进以实现更稳健的时序推理。

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

*Wenhang Shi,Shuqing Bian,Yiren Chen,Xinyi Zhang,Zhe Zhao,Pengfei Hu,Wei Lu,Xiaoyong Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT 推理在 NLU 中的潜在价值被系统检验：构建 NLURC 数据集并探索各类 rationale-augmented 方法。结果显示：1) 随着模型规模增大，推理式 CoT 从对性能的负影响转为优于直接标签预测，呈正相关；2) 大多数基于 rationale 的训练方法不如仅标签训练，只有一种方法能持续改进；3) 用 rationales 训练的 LLM 在未见的 NLU 任务上性能显著提升，甚至与十倍规模模型相媲美，同时具备良好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 CoT racionales 在推理任务中表现出色，但其对 NLU 任务的影响尚未系统研究。本文通过构建高质量的 NLURC 数据集并设计多种 rationale 增强方法，系统评估 rationale 对 NLU 的作用，填补该领域空白。

Method: 构建 NLURC 数据集并实现多种 rationale-augmented 策略（在推理阶段生成 rations、或在训练阶段将 rationales 放在答案前后等），在多任务 NLU 数据集上进行广泛评估，比较不同方法的效果。

Result: 关键发现包括：1) CoT 推理在模型规模增大时对 NLU 的影响从负向转为正向，且与模型规模呈正相关；2) 大多数 rationale 训练方法不如“仅标签训练”，仅有一种方法保持并提升性能；3) 用 rationales 训练的 LLM 在未见 NLU 任务上取得显著的性能提升，能与比其小十倍的模型相当，并具备与商业 LLM 相当的可解释性。

Conclusion: Rationale 的使用对 NLU 的影响是显著且复杂的，效果高度依赖模型规模与训练方法。未来工作应进一步设计更有效的 rationale-augmented 训练策略，并在更广泛的 NLU 任务上验证可解释性与泛化性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在多轮对话中对冲突问题表现出摇摆/变stances的“变色龙”行为，提出Chameleon基准和两项指标，评估多模型，发现知识多样性不足与对查询框架的依赖相关，强调在关键领域部署前需全面一致性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM与检索系统耦合中缺乏对话前后一致性的系统性评估问题，揭示在多轮、带检索的场景中，模型容易随查询框架改变stance，影响可靠性。

Method: 构建Chameleon Benchmark数据集，包含1,180个多轮对话，约17,770条问答，覆盖12个有争议领域；提出Chameleon Score和Source Re-use Rate两个理论指标；在Llama-4-Maverick、GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.5-Flash等模型上进行评估；分析温度变动对结果的敏感性，计算相关性r值和显著性p值。

Result: 所有评测模型均表现出明显的chameleon行为，得分约0.391-0.511；GPT-4o-mini表现最差；跨温度方差很小（<0.004），非采样导致的artifact；source reuse rate与confidence的相关性r=0.627、与stance changes相关性r=0.429，且p<0.05；知识多样性受限导致模型对查询框架过于迎合。

Conclusion: 在关键领域的部署前，应进行全面的一致性评估；设计更强的知识多样性、抗框架偏置的策略，以及面向健康、法律、金融等高风险场景的稳定性评估。

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

TL;DR: 研究白空格（Whitespace）作为诗歌形态的语义与空间特征。以 Poetry Foundation 的2.8万诗歌数据集对比分析，揭示诗人对空格的使用与随时间、形式、数据来源的变化，并指出文本处理方法会显著影响诗歌数据中的空白表示，讨论其对大模型预训练数据集构建的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充空白在诗歌中的重要性与作为NLP特征的研究空白。希望通过系统分析不同数据源和数据处理对空白分布的影响，提升对诗歌生成任务与预训练数据准备的理解。

Method: 构建包含19k首英语诗歌的 Poetry Foundation 数据集；公开2.8k份保留排版的公有领域诗歌以便复现；与(1) 51k 由LLMs生成的诗歌和(2) 12k未发表在线诗歌进行对比；按时间段、诗歌形式、数据来源分组分析空白分布；评估不同文本处理方法对空白表示的影响以讨论对LLM预训练数据集的含义。

Result: 发现空白分布反映诗人艺术选择，是诗歌的语义与空间特征；不同数据源（人类创作、LLM生成、未发表文本）与时期/形式存在显著差异；文本处理方法对空白表示有显著影响，可能影响诗歌数据在模型训练中的表现与评价；提出需要在整理预训练数据时重视空白模式的研究与再现性。

Conclusion: 空白是有意义的诗歌特征，应在预训练数据集构建与文本处理策略中给予充分考量；未来研究可扩展到更多语言、更多诗歌形式以及跨数据源的稳定性分析，并提供可复现的数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

TL;DR: Beacon 是一个单次对比强制选择基准，用以分离并测量大型语言模型中的 sycophancy（拍马屁式偏见）对真确性与順从性之间的结构性权衡；揭示语言和情感子偏见随模型容量上升而稳定存在，并展现对齐中的动态几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并量化语言模型在Truthfulness（真实性）与社会性顺从之间的偏好（sycophancy），以改进对齐并减少规范性错误泛化。

Method: 提出 Beacon 基准，在 twelve 量级模型上进行单轮的强制选择测试，独立于对话上下文；分析其语言性与情感性子偏见；探索提示层和激活层干预对偏见的调控。

Result: sycophancy 分解为稳定的语言性和情感性子偏见，且两者随模型容量提升而放大；提示级与激活级干预能够朝相反方向调控这些偏见，暴露对齐的内部几何为真确性与社会合规判断之间的动态流形。

Conclusion: Beacon 提供一个可重复的基准，用于研究和缓解大型生成系统中的对齐漂移，将 sycophancy 视为可测量的规范性误泛化。

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

TL;DR: LC-Eval 是一个面向长上下文理解的双语多任务评测基准（英语/阿拉伯语），覆盖4k-128k token，含四类任务，评估开放式与封闭式大模型；结果显示当前模型在长上下文推理方面仍具挑战性，甚至 GPT-4o 在部分任务上表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要更严格的长上下文能力评估来量化大语言模型在大规模上下文中的理解与推理能力；现有基准难以覆盖长期上下文和跨语言情景，因此需要一个面向英语与阿拉伯语的对比评估框架。

Method: 提出 LC-Eval 基准，包含四项任务：多文档问答、双语问答、段落内的主张/断言验证、以及基于长上下文的多项选择题；数据覆盖英语与阿拉伯语，支持4k到128k tokens 的上下文长度；在开放权重和闭源模型上进行评测，侧重深度推理、文档理解、信息追踪和跨语言信息提取。

Result: 评测表明 LC-Eval 对现有模型具有显著挑战性，甚至高性能模型如 GPT-4o 在某些任务上也存在困难，显示长上下文理解和跨语言信息处理的研究空白。

Conclusion: LC-Eval 提供了一个严格的双语长上下文评测基准，有助于推动长上下文推理与跨语言信息理解的改进，并便于对不同模型进行横向比较。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend
extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation
methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding.
In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

### [36] [MOSAIC: Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16797)
*Vera Pavlova,Mohammed Makhlouf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC 是一个多阶段的领域自适应框架，针对句子嵌入模型，通过 jointly 进行 MLM 与对比学习的监督，能在保持原模型语义判别能力的同时学习领域相关表征，在高/低资源领域实现对比基线的显著提升（NDCG@10 最大提升 13.4%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模通用域句子嵌入模型在迁移到专业域时面临领域偏移和语义判别能力丧失的风险，需要一种能在单一训练流程中同时学习领域特有表征与保持泛化能力的方法。

Method: 提出 MOSAIC：一个多阶段框架，在统一训练管线中联合优化领域特定的遮蔽语言建模 (MLM) 与对比学习目标，结合选择性自适应策略进行分阶段微调，实现领域相关表示与原模型判别能力的双重保留。

Result: 在高资源与低资源领域的实证验证中，相较强的通用基线，NDCG@10 提升高达 13.4%，并通过消融研究确认平衡的联合监督和分阶段自适应的重要性。

Conclusion: MOSAIC 能有效将大规模通用 sentence embedding 模型迁移至专业域，同时保持良好的语义判别能力，联合监督与阶段性自适应是关键组件，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

### [37] [Knowing the Facts but Choosing the Shortcut: Understanding How Large Language Models Compare Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16815)
*Hans Hergen Lehmann,Jae Hee Lee,Steven Schockaert,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models often rely on superficial cues rather than genuine numerical knowledge in entity comparison tasks; model size affects reliance on numerical information, with larger models using numerical facts more carefully. Chain-of-thought prompting increases numerical feature use across sizes. A simple surface-cue model can predict model choices better than the models themselves in smaller sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when LLMs use true knowledge versus heuristics in knowledge-based reasoning, and how model size and prompting affect this balance.

Method: Evaluate entity comparison tasks with numerical attributes (e.g., river lengths) across model sizes. Identify biases (popularity, mention order, semantic co-occurrence). Train a logistic regression on surface cues to predict model choices. Test chain-of-thought prompting to see its effect on reliance on numerical information.

Result: Three heuristic biases strongly influence predictions. Larger models (32B) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when reliable, while smaller models (7–8B) do not. Logistic-regression on surface cues can predict model choices better than the models' own numerical predictions. Chain-of-thought prompting shifts all models toward using numerical features.

Conclusion: Model size modulates reliance on numerical knowledge in reasoning tasks; chain-of-thought prompting can steer models toward more grounded reasoning. Addressing surface heuristics is essential to improve robustness, especially for smaller models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

*Shantanu Agarwal,Joel Barry,Steven Fincke,Scott Miller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段检索-再排序框架用于跨体裁作者身份识别（AA），通过对再排序器进行针对性数据策划，使其学习不依赖文本主题的作者特征。实验在 HIATUS 的 HRS1/HRS2 基准上分别实现 22.3 和 34.4 个绝对的 Success@8 增益，超越前一状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨体裁AA需要捕捉与主题无关的作者风格信号，但传统的信息检索（IR）中的检索-再排序策略往往利用主题线索，导致跨体裁任务上的性能偏离。需通过数据层面的定制来引导再排序器聚焦作者特征。

Method: 提出一个两阶段框架：1) 检索阶段用LLMs微调以对候选作者进行跨体裁文档检索；2) 再排序阶段对LLMs进行微调，并通过针对性数据策划（平衡主题、混淆案例等）来学习作者辨别信号，避免主题相关性误导。

Result: 在 HIATUS 的 HRS1/HRS2 基准上，新的方法分别实现 22.3 和 34.4 的绝对 Success@8 提升，显著高于先前的SOTA。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的检索-再排序结合定制数据策略，能有效提升跨体裁AA的鲁棒性与准确性，且避免对主题的过度利用。未来可扩展到更多跨域作者识别任务。

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using
our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of
22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on
HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

*Navreet Kaur,Hoda Ayad,Hayoung Jung,Shravika Mittal,Munmun De Choudhury,Tanushree Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 建立一个基于角色的问答评估框架CoRUS，利用OUD线上社区数据构建提问者角色分类并生成大量同角色的问答，将不同角色的线索嵌入问题中；比较五个大语言模型的回答，发现患者/照顾者等脆弱角色更可能获得支持性回复但知识性内容较少，强调用户角色对对话系统输出的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数评估关注模型的回答质量，忽略提问者的身份/角色对回答的影响。在高污名化领域如阿片类使用障碍（OUD）中，考虑用户的背景和目标对提供可及、无污名化的回答尤为关键，因此需要一个能在评估中引入角色信息的框架。

Method: 1) 基于r/OpiatesRecovery等OUD康复社区的信息，构建提问者角色的分层分类（患者、照顾者、从业者等）。2) 以此角色 taxonomy 为基础，生成15,321个带有角色目标、行为和经历的问答样本。3) 将这组样本用于评估五个LLM，在相同问题但角色不同的条件下比较输出差异。4) 使用可验证性评价，检验问题的可信度及与真实世界数据的相似性。

Result: - 生成的问题具有高度可信性，与真实世界数据相近。- 不同角色呈现系统性差异：脆弱角色（患者、照顾者）引发的回答更具支持性，在知识性内容方面低于从业者，大约分别增加±17%、降低约19%。

Conclusion: 信号化的用户角色会显著影响模型输出，CoRUS 提供了一种面向角色的信息化评估方法，帮助研究者在对话式AI评估中纳入用户背景，从而推动更具包容性与定制化的对话系统研究与应用。

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

*Zhihui Yang,Yupei Wang,Kaijie Mo,Zhe Zhao,Renfen Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对比视觉-语言模型与文本模型在具身知识理解上的表现，发现视觉信息并未带来优势，且视觉维度表现较差；需更好地整合具身知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态语言模型取得进展，仍不清楚视觉 grounding 是否提升对具身知识的理解。作者提出一个覆盖多感官的具身知识理解基准，评估不同模态对物理世界理解的贡献。

Method: 基于心理学的感知理论构建具身知识理解基准，涵盖视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉外感官与内感知；通过向量比较和问答两类任务（共1,700+题）评估30种前沿语言模型的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，视觉语言模型未优于文本模型，在两类任务中均不领先；在感知维度中，视觉维度表现最差；向量表示易受单词形式与频率影响，模型在空间感知与推理方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 需要更有效地将具身知识整合进语言模型，以提升对物理世界的理解，评估应关注感知维度与语义-感知对齐的改进方向。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

TL;DR: ChiKhaPo 是一个覆盖2700+语言的多语言基准，包含8个子任务，聚焦词汇理解与生成能力；基于词典、单语数据与双语语料构建，覆盖2个子任务达到大规模语言覆盖；评测显示6个SOTA模型表现不佳，分析受语言家族、资源水平、任务类型及理解与生成方向等因素影响，目标在于推动大规模多语言LLM的基准评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多偏向高/中资源语言，且常评估较高层次的推理与生成任务；全球有超过3800种书面语言，大多数缺乏基本的语言能力评估，因此需要更广泛的语言覆盖并聚焦词汇层面的能力评估。

Method: 设计8个难度不等的子任务，利用现有词典、单语数据与双语文本构建评测集合；覆盖2700+语言中用于2个子任务的语言较多，整体覆盖优于现有基准；在6个SOTA模型上进行评测，并分析语言家族、资源程度、任务类型以及理解与生成方向对分数的影响。

Result: 6个SOTA模型在 ChiKhaPo 上表现不佳，受语言家族与资源丰富度等因素影响；ChiKhaPo 提供的语言覆盖率超过现有基准，暴露了模型在词汇层面的局限性。

Conclusion: ChiKhaPo 旨在推动对大规模多语言LLM的系统性基准评测，鼓励对低资源语言的词汇能力的研究与资源建设，为未来模型与数据准备提供方向。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

TL;DR: PROMPT-MII 是一个基于 RL 的指令诱导元学习框架，通过学习将训练示例压缩成紧凑且具描述性的提示，在新数据集上也能达到与 ICL 相当的效果，且显著减少上下文 token 数量（3-13x）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大语言模型中使用就地学习（ICL）时随上下文长度增加导致的推理成本高的问题；通过生成紧凑的、可描述的提示来替代大规模上下文，从而在多任务上实现高效适应。

Method: 提出 RL-based PROMPT-MII 框架，元学习一个指令诱导模型，能对任意新数据集即时生成紧凑指令。训练基于来自 HuggingFace 的 3,000+ 个多样化数据集，在 90 个未见任务上评估。

Result: 在下游模型上提升 4-9 个 F1 点（相对约 10-20%），达到与 ICL 等效的性能，同时减少 3-13 倍的 token 使用。

Conclusion: 基于 RL 的指令诱导方法可作为大上下文 ICL 的有效替代，在多样化任务上实现高效适配并显著降低推理成本。

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

TL;DR: 使用参数高效微调（PEFT）对孟加拉语仇恨言论检测进行高效微调，利用 LoRA/QLoRA，在 BD-SHS 数据集上取得显著性能。Llama-3.2-3B 获得最高 F1 92.23%，证明低资源语言中的 PEFT 具可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模全模型微调成本高、对外部 API 依赖等问题，同时针对孟加拉语等低资源语言提升检测性能。

Method: 在三种指令微调的大语言模型（Gemma-3-4B、Llama-3.2-3B、Mistral-7B）上，使用 LoRA/QLoRA 对 BD-SHS（50,281 条注释评论）进行微调，训练参数占比<1%，可在家用显卡上完成。

Result: 在测试中，Llama-3.2-3B 的 F1 为 92.23%，Mistral-7B 为 88.94%，Gemma-3-4B 为 80.25%

Conclusion: PEFT 是孟加拉语及相关低资源语言的一个实用且可重复的微调策略。

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 UTF8Tokenizer—a 极简字节级分词器，将文本映射为其 UTF-8 字节的逐字节 ID，避免越界 ID 与辅助标记，所有特殊行为通过 C0 控制字节编码，提升速度、嵌入表可移植性，并在训练中通过位 biased 嵌入实现性能提升；且兼容 HuggingFace，能提升语言模型收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往字节级分词器存在的越界 ID、额外标记等问题；希望使用纯字节映射、便于跨模型对齐、并提升分词与训练效率；通过控制字节嵌入实现简单且高效的 embedding 表结构。

Method: 文本映射为 UTF-8 字节序列，token id 即字节值；使用 256*d 的嵌入表，所有特殊行为用 C0 控制字节编码（Padding、边界、对话结构、注意力分段、工具调用、思考 span 等均如此）；没有 256 的独立 token；实现与 HuggingFace 兼容；训练时通过位 bias 嵌入揭示每字节位结构，且可在训练后加入嵌入表以降低推理成本。

Result: 在语言建模中实现收敛性提升；实证上显著提升：分词速度提升约 14 倍，主机与设备之间的数据传输量减少约 8 倍（相对于 int64 序列）；嵌入表简单且可跨模型对齐；训练时的位 bias 嵌入提升了表示能力，降低推理成本；HuggingFace 兼容性有助于模型收敛。

Conclusion: 设计原则带来实际效益：极简且无额外 tokens 的字节级表示使分词与嵌入更高效、易移植、易对齐；通过控制字节实现对特殊行为的编码，提升实现简洁性与性能，并具备潜在训练阶段的嵌入改进途径，且与现有生态兼容。

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

*Yuval Reif,Guy Kaplan,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于基础形式词和变换向量的可组合词汇设计，通过对词形变化的线性偏移来表示派生/形态变体，实现减少词汇表大小且提升覆盖率，同时保持下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词将词形变体视为独立标记，导致词汇表膨胀、对低频词和多语种覆盖不足。若能用线性变换向量将变体从基础词构建出来，便可以更紧凑的词汇结构提升覆盖并节省位容量。

Method: 在输入与输出向量空间中观察到词形变体可通过加性偏移得到表示；提出将词汇表重塑为由基础形式词和变换向量组合而成的结构，如“walked”=“walk”+过去式向量；对多种大语言模型和五种语言进行实验，评估词汇表规模缩减与覆盖率提升对下游任务的影响。

Result: 可移除多达约10%的词汇条目，同时提升对词汇表外词汇的覆盖能力；对下游性能影响微小；无需修改模型权重即可实现。

Conclusion: 从字符串枚举转向可组合词汇的设计具有潜在的语言学和工程学意义，表明以基础形式和变换向量的组合方式来表示词汇，是提升多语言覆盖和资源利用的可行方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

Motivation: 迭代越狱方法通过重复改写并输入提示，利用模型前述回复来引导下一轮攻击，是对LLMs及其安全机制的高效攻击。现有防御缺乏主动打断这种试错循环的能力，需要一个能在每个新提示后自适应更新的防御策略，能够区分有害与无害提示，同时避免对攻击者的有限改写空间过拟合。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的提示优化防御，进行在线学习以在每次提示后更新策略，使对无害任务给出恰当回复的同时显式拒绝有害提示；并引入Past-Direction Gradient Damping（PDGD）以缓解对攻击中狭窄输入空间的过拟合。对三种LLM及五种迭代越狱方法进行了对比评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在三种LLM上显著优于五种现有防御，对五种迭代越狱方法具有鲁棒性。同时，提示优化策略还提升了无害任务的回答质量。

Conclusion: 动态在线学习与PDGD相结合的防御框架能有效抵御迭代越狱攻击，并在保护系统安全的同时改善无害任务的输出质量，具有良好的鲁棒性与推广潜力；未来工作可关注对新型攻击的泛化能力及在更大规模模型上的扩展。

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

### [47] [DiscoTrack: A Multilingual LLM Benchmark for Discourse Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17013)
*Lanni Bu,Lauren Levin,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiscoTrack is a multilingual LLM benchmark for discourse-level understanding across 12 languages, covering salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations, and bridging inference; results show current models still struggle with these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks mainly target explicit information extraction within sentences and are limited in testing implicit, pragmatic inferences across larger documents and across languages. There is a need for challenging, multilingual benchmarks that assess discourse tracking across sentences, paragraphs, and speaker turns.

Method: DiscoTrack is introduced as a benchmark spanning 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding (salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations, bridging inference). It evaluates LLMs on tasks requiring integration and aggregation of information across sentences, paragraphs, and utterances.

Result: Evaluation shows these discourse-level tasks remain challenging for state-of-the-art models, indicating a significant gap between model performance and the level of discourse understanding required across languages.

Conclusion: DiscoTrack fills a gap in multilingual discourse understanding benchmarks, highlighting the need for improved long-context reasoning and cross-sentence inference capabilities in modern LLMs and providing a framework to measure progress in this area.

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are
still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of
explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar-
geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more
challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on
implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the
context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across
sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present
DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages
and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity
tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that
these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本工作将提示敏感性问题置于不确定性校准的框架内，提出通过对同义且语义等价的提示进行 paraphrase 采样来提高校准效果，同时引入一个考虑语义连续性的全新不确定性分解度量，用于量化提示敏感性对不确定性的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示敏感性导致同一任务在不同等价提示下输出分布差异显著，进而使得模型输出的不确定性不能准确反映对输入含义的不确定性。需要在语义概念空间中进行采样以提升不确定性校准，并且希望用更合理的分解来理解不确定性来源，尤其是在黑箱式大语言模型中。

Method: 1）对同义/等价但语义略有差异的提示作 paraphrase 扰动，采样其语义概念空间的多种版本；2）在黑箱 LLM 上评估采样对不确定性校准和准确性的影响；3）提出一种新的不确定性分解度量，结合自然语言生成中的语义连续性，优于基于熵的分解；4）通过该分解量化提示敏感性对模型不确定性的贡献。

Result: 通过对 paraphrase 的采样实现了不牺牲甚至提升的校准效果，同时保持或提升了准确性。新引入的分解度量在分解不确定性来源时优于基于熵的传统方法，能够量化提示敏感性对不确定性的贡献。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种在提示敏感的语言模型中改进不确定性校准的新路径，并提供证据表明部分大语言模型对输入意义的通用推理不具备一致性。该方法还为评估和诊断模型在不同提示下的不确定性提供了工具。

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt
sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions
of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.
This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution
for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DVAGen 是一个开源、统一的动态词汇框架，用于训练、评估和可视化动态词汇增强的语言模型，提供 CLI 与 WebUI，提升推理吞吐量并兼容主流开源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定词汇表的语言模型在面对新词或未登录词时泛化能力差，限制对多样化标记组合的处理。现有动态词汇方法存在代码碎片化、对现代大型语言模型支持不足以及推理扩展性有限等问题。

Method: DVAGen 提供一个完全开源、统一的框架，模块化管线用于训练、评估和可视化，能够无缝对接开源 LLM，并首次同时提供 CLI 与 WebUI 以实现实时结果查看；并支持批量推理以提升推理吞吐量。

Result: 在现代大型语言模型上验证了动态词汇方法的有效性，并展示了对批量推理的支持，从而显著提升推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: DVAGen 为动态词汇方法提供一个可扩展、易用的统一平台，便于训练、评估和可视化，并在推理吞吐量方面带来实质性提升，推动该领域的方法学与应用实现。

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

*Jiaqi Leng,Xiang Hu,Junxiong Wang,Jianguo Li,Wei Wu,Yucheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过统一框架对基于块的稀疏注意力模型进行系统解剖，提出三条关键设计原则并实现无训练的超长记忆泛化，显著提升从4K上下文到32M标记的长度外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效处理极长上下文是语言模型的核心挑战。标准Transformer的二次复杂度与外推能力有限，其他架构如滑动窗口或状态空间模型要么在全局上下文利用上受限，要么有固定大小内存。块状稀疏注意力成为极长文本泛化的一种有前景范式，但其关键原理尚未被充分理解。

Method: 提出一个统一的分析框架并进行全面的消融研究，系统分解块状稀疏注意力模型的组成部分，识别影响性能的核心设计要素。通过理论动机、对Chunk Encoder、CLS表达、Bypassing Residual Path以及预训练阶段的选择稀疏性等要素的综合分析，结合在RULER和 Babilong 数据集上的超长上下文测试，验证设计原则的有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明：三大设计原则的组合对性能至关重要；引入一个具备非线性表达能力的Chunk Encoder并使用专门的CLS标记用于检索、采用Bypassing Residual Path稳定整合全局信息、以及在预训练阶段强制选择性稀疏性以减小训练-测试分布差距，能够实现训练无微调的长度外推，模型从4K上下文成功泛化到32M标记，达到新的状态-of-the-art。理论部分给出块内信息处理与 landmarks 生成的动机。

Conclusion: 本工作给出了一组有力的、经验驱动的设计原则，为未来的长上下文语言模型提供路线图，尤其是在极端长度泛化方面的设计与训练策略。

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

*Chenchen Tan,Youyang Qu,Xinghao Li,Hui Zhang,Shujie Cui,Cunjian Chen,Longxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了 Attention-Shifting (AS) 框架用于选择性去学习，通过注意力层面的两种干预实现对未学习内容的抑制与保留内容的强化，以实现对模型知识的局部化去学习并尽量保持其他知识。实验显示 AS 在 ToFU/ TDEC 基准上显著提升知识保留能力，同时抑制虚构回答的倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算能力和 AI 辅助决策的普及，LLMs 可能记忆敏感信息，导致对知识的“去学习”需求增加。然而，过于激进的去学习会损害模型效用，过于保守则可能加剧幻觉。需要一种能够在保持语言结构的前提下，降低对需要去学习的事实性记忆的依赖，同时抑制关于去学习内容的虚假回答的机制。

Method: 提出 Attention-Shifting 框架，包含两种注意力层面的干预：1) 重要性相关的抑制（importance-aware suppression），对待去学习集合的注意力进行抑制，减少对记忆知识的依赖；2) 基于注意力的保留增强（attention-guided retention enhancement），强化对保留数据中语义重要Token的注意力，以减轻潜在的知识遗留导致的降级。两者通过双重损失进行联合优化，形成软边界，使去学习局部化且不干扰其他知识的表示叠加。

Result: 相比现有去学习方法，AS 在保留效用方面表现更好，在 ToFU 基准上提升高达 15%，在 TDEC 基准上提升约 10%，同时保持竞争力的无幻觉去学习效果。相较于现有方法，AS 在去学习效果、泛化能力和回答可靠性之间实现了更优平衡。

Conclusion: AS 提供了一种在保持模型语言结构的前提下实现局部化去学习的有效路径，通过注意力层面的抑制与保留增强实现对未学习内容的抑制与对保留知识的强化，达到更佳的效用保留与回答可靠性平衡。

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

*Junlong Tong,Yingqi Fan,Anhao Zhao,Yunpu Ma,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了 StreamingThinker 的“流式思考”范式，使 LLM 在阅读时就开始推理，随后再根据阅读完成情况调整深度。通过流式推理单元、流式约束训练、以及并行 KV 缓存等机制实现输入有序、并行推理，显著降低等待和时延，同时保持与批量思考相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 LL M 推理在获得完整输入后才开始推理，造成额外延迟且对前期信息的注意力不足。受到人类“边读边想”的启发，提出在动态场景中提前对信息进行处理和推理，以提升实时性和对早期信息的利用。

Method: 提出 StreamingThinker 框架，包含流式 CoT 生成、流式约束训练和流式并行推理。核心是：使用带质量控制的流式推理单元进行 CoT 生成；通过流式注意力掩码和位置编码确保推理的顺序性；采用并行 KV 缓存，将输入编码与推理生成解耦，实现真正的并发和对齐。对 Qwen3 系列模型在数学推理、逻辑推理、基于上下文的问答推理等任务进行评估。

Result: 实验证明 StreamingThinker 的性能与批量思考相当，但在以下方面显著提升：token 在推理开始前的等待时间下降约 80%，最终输出的时延下降超过 60% 。

Conclusion: 流式思考范式在提高 LLM 推理实时性方面有效，能在保持近似原有性能的同时显著缩短推理时延。代码将发布在 GitHub 仓库中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 VideoBiasEval 框架，用于在视频生成的对齐管线中诊断社会偏见，通过事件级提示和多层级指标，连接偏见在数据集、奖励模型和扩散模型中的传播，发现对齐可放大并使偏见更长期稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型在文本到视频生成上获得提升，但通过基于人类偏好训练的奖励模型对齐，可能无意中放大社会偏见，需要系统化地追踪偏见在对齐流程中的演化。

Method: 提出事件级提示策略以将语义内容与角色属性分离，构建多粒度度量（总体种族偏见、基于种族的性别偏见、不同模型变体的分布变化、视频中的偏见的时间持续性），并进行端到端分析，链接人类偏好数据集、奖励模型和对齐后的视频扩散模型。

Result: 实验揭示对齐调优不仅加强了表征偏见，还使其在时间上更稳定，呈现更平滑但更刻板的表现。

Conclusion: 需要在对齐过程的各阶段进行偏见感知评估与缓解，以实现更公平、负责任的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

Motivation: 揭示新闻报道中的情感框架如何影响公众情绪与关注度，填补孟加拉语新闻情感分析的规模化研究空白，并探讨跨媒体的情感差异对信息消费的潜在影响。

Method: 使用 Gemma-3 4B 的零-shot 分类对约 30 万条孟加拉语新闻标题及其内容进行情感和基调识别，统计主导情感及整体情绪倾向，比较不同媒体在同一事件上的情感呈现，并提出设计原型用于情感可视化与揭示隐性情感框架。

Result: 研究发现负性情绪占主导，尤其是愤怒、恐惧和失望；同一新闻在不同媒体中的情感表达存在显著差异；基于此提出面向读者的人本新闻聚合器的情感可视化设计思路，用以帮助读者识别潜在的情感操控。

Conclusion: 结论表明媒体在叙事中广泛使用负面情绪框架以提升关注度，同时研究也提供了一个可视化工具方向，帮助读者理解日常新闻中的情感偏见与潜在框架。

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

Result: 在 CS-TaxoBench 上对比多种基线方法，TaxoAlign 在几乎所有指标上持续超越基线；通过自动评估和人工评估的结果均支持这一结论；代码和数据可在 GitHub 获取。

Conclusion: TaxoAlign 及其评估基准为自动化学术 taxonomy 生成提供了有效的解决方案，推动了结构对齐与语义连贯性评估的一致性，并为未来研究提供了可复用的数据与工具。

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

Result: 多模态模型普遍优于单模态基线；晚融合模型 mBERT + WD-SGCN 在总体上表现最佳，abuse detection 得分 0.718，peer-group identification 得分 0.286，bullying analysis 得分 0.606；误差分析显示其在隐性攻击、角色转移和情境相关的敌意等细粒度ASB现象上具有较强处理能力。

Conclusion: 证实多模态融合在多方对话中的ASB检测中具有显著优势，尤其对隐性攻击与情境依赖的敌意具有更强鲁棒性，为未来的研究提供有效基线与数据资源。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,
harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and
societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,
and context-dependent hostility.

### [59] [The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388)
*Henry Lim,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 系统评估20个指令调优的大型语言模型在修改后的MMLU任务上对“原子级”指令的遵循能力，发现显著的指令格式偏差、对指令的遵循不稳定、在无选项内容或非数字标签条件下性能下降明显，以及三-shot示例对鲁棒性帮助有限。需要新的评估和训练策略专门针对原子指令遵循。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管IT-LLMs在零-shot推理方面表现突出，但在执行简单、独立的指示方面的能力尚未被充分研究。评估对原子指令遵循的能力是理解并提升复杂指令遵循行为的基础。

Method: 系统地在修改的MMLU/MMLU-Pro上改变选项标签的格式（字母、数字、罗马数字），意义相同，在四个范式下进行评估：(1) 有明确指令时，标签格式改变导致显著性能波动（如 Roman vs 数字约-30.45%）；(2) 无指令时，性能进一步下降（最高约-10.84%）且对标签的敏感性加剧；(3) 当去除选项内容时，模型在随机选项基线下表现不及随机，只有数字标签能维持接近合理的遵循；(4) 三-shot示例对鲁棒性与保真度无显著提升。对生成结果的分析显示非数字格式的标签错误依然普遍。

Result: 跨模型规模，越大的LLM获得的准确性越高，但在指令遵循的原子性方面仍不稳定，且对指令的遵循存在显著不一致性。α级别存在较强的指令格式偏置，且缺乏对原子指令的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前的指令微调范式在原子级别的指令遵循能力上存在明显不足，需要新的评估方法与训练策略，明确针对原子性指令遵循进行优化。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduAdapt 提供近4.8万条按年级标注的科学问答数据集，覆盖九科、Grades 1–12，首次为LLMs的分级教育适配性构建评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育领域需要对学生的发展阶段进行回答输出的恰当性和可读性进行评估，而现有LLMs在年级对齐方面存在不足，缺乏统一的基准来衡量对不同认知阶段的适配性。

Method: 构建规模接近48k的问答对，按 Grades 1–12 分为四个等级，覆盖九门科学科目；在多种开源LLMs上进行评估，分析其对早期年级（Grades 1–5）的回答适配性；代码和数据公开，便于社区复现与扩展。

Result: 较大模型总体表现更佳，但在低年级（1–5）仍显不足，难以生成符合低龄学习者的恰当、具体且易懂的回答；这是首个用于评估LLMs分级教育能力的数据集与评估框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为教育AI的发展提供基准与方向，强调通过改进训练与提示策略来提升面向不同发展阶段的输出质量，促进更开发性对齐的教育AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better
training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Ladder-base，首个用于中医领域的大语言模型，采用 GRPO 强化学习，基于 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct，专门在 TCM-Ladder 的文本子集上训练并以组内比较优化响应选择来提升推理与事实一致性。与通用模型和领域专用模型相比，在标准化评估中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TCM 知识系统在结构性和专业性方面对传统大语言模型构成挑战；现有的 TCM 专用 LLM 在对齐、数据质量与评估一致性方面存在局限，亟需更有效的对齐策略以实现临床可信性与推理可靠性。

Method: 以 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct 为基础，在 TCM-Ladder 的文本子集上进行训练，数据集按 80% 训练、20% 验证/测试分割；采用 GRPO（基于组内比较的策略优化）作为强化学习信号，通过组内对比来优化回复选择与推理质量。

Result: 在标准化评估中，Ladder-base 在多项推理指标上优于通用强模型（如 GPT-4、Gemini 2.5、Claude 3、Qwen3）及其他领域模型（如 BenTsao、HuatuoGPT2、Zhongjing）。显示 GRPO 能有效提升领域对齐与事实一致性。

Conclusion: GRPO 提供了一种高效且具可验证性的对齐路径，使 LLM 更贴近专家级推理，推动传统医学领域的可信临床 AI 发展。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique
knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language
models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through
supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM
artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: 证明通过自然语言指令微调和多模态整合可以构建面向中医领域的 LLM；提供一个对齐生成式 AI 与传统医理推理的可操作框架，并为现实世界部署提供可扩展路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对齐成本不仅包括准确率下降，还伴随严重的校准损失；通过在对齐前后权重之间进行简单插值进行模型合并，可以发现帕累托最优解，提升准确率并恢复校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决后训练对齐带来的全面成本（精度下降、校准下降、输出多样性下降等），提高模型的可靠性与性能，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 在对齐前后的权重之间进行后处理插值（模型合并），系统性地搜索插值路径，发现并评估帕累托最优解，使得合并后的模型在准确性、校准和输出多样性上实现折中或超越。

Result: 发现插值过程持续呈现帕累托最优解：某些插值点的准确性超过两端父代模型，并显著恢复对齐过程中损失的校准；输出更可靠且具有更好的多样性；方法计算开销低，作为缓解对齐税的高效手段。

Conclusion: 简单的模型合并（权重插值）即可全面缓解对齐税，得到更强、更可靠的模型，同时具备良好的计算效率。

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

TL;DR: 为乌尔都语到英语的成语翻译建立首个评测数据集，比较多种开源LLMs与NMT系统在保持成语与文化意义方面的能力；提示工程有显著提升，但不同提示类型差异有限；本地乌尔都语输入较罗马乌尔都语更利于成语翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成语翻译在低资源语言中尤为困难，缺乏统一的评估基准，亟须评估跨脚本和跨模型在保留成语意义方面的能力，以推动相关研究。

Method: 构建覆盖原生乌尔都语和罗马乌尔都语脚本的乌尔都语-英语成语翻译评测数据集，并提供金标准译文；评估多种开源LLMs与NMT系统在保持成语与文化含义方面的表现；使用BLEU、BERTScore、COMET、XCOMET等自动评估指标；对比提示工程与直译的影响，以及原生与罗曼乌尔都语文本的差异。

Result: 提示工程优于直接翻译在成语翻译上的表现，且不同提示类型之间差异较小；文本表示对翻译质量影响显著，原生乌尔都语输入的成语翻译准确性高于罗马乌尔都语。

Conclusion: 提示设计和输入脚本选择对乌尔都语成语翻译质量具有显著影响；建立首个评测数据集可推动低资源语言成语翻译研究，未来工作可聚焦跨脚本表示、提示优化以及更多模型的比较。

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Motivation: 确保在全球健康场景中，获取到可信的多语言健康信息；避免因训练数据语言不均而导致信息质量差异。

Method: 构建多语言维基医疗数据集 MultiWikiHealthCare（含英语、德语、土耳其语、中文、意大利语），分析跨语言覆盖与参考资料对齐，评估 LLM 回答与引用源的一致性，并通过在推理阶段使用上下文信息和检索增强生成（RAG）进行事实对齐的案例研究。

Result: 在维基覆盖与事实对齐方面存在显著差异；多数模型的回答更倾向于英文维基，且即使提示为非英文。将非英文维基的上下文片段引入推理时，事实对齐向该语言相关知识倾斜。

Conclusion: 为构建更公平的多语言医疗AI提供务实路径，强调通过上下文注入与检索增强来改善跨语言事实对齐和信息可用性。

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

TL;DR: ReXMoE 提出跨层路由的 MoE 架构，通过在相邻层复用专家并引入渐进扩展的路由策略，解耦每层预算与专家维度，在不增加总参数量的情况下提升路由表达能力和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 MoE 的层本地路由限制了可用专家组合的多样性，需在专家维度与路由多样性之间做权衡。

Method: 设计 ReXMoE 架构，允许跨层复用专家；提出渐进扩展路由 PSR 策略，训练阶段逐步增加候选专家池。

Result: 在 0.5B–7B 参数规模的多种架构上进行广泛实验，显示在固定架构维度下，ReXMoE 能提升语言建模及下游任务表现。

Conclusion: ReXMoE 为参数高效且可扩展的 MoE-LLM 提供新范式，打破层本地路由的局限性，提升路由表达力和模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别 AI 参与文本的挑战在于多种人机协作生成过程导致文本特征的复杂性，现有方法多以二分类或多类分类，难以捕捉过程之间的潜在层级关系。

Method: 构建一个 Hierarchical Affinity Tree 来建模不同生成过程之间的关系，并设计专门的损失函数以让文本表征对齐树结构；搭建 RealBench 数据集以自动合成多样化混合文本。

Result: 相较于基线，方法在混合文本检测任务上提升鲁棒性与泛化性，尤其在 OOD 和少样本情形表现显著改善。

Conclusion: 将训练过程中的结构性关系纳入损失，展现基于树形关系的文本表征对混合文本检测更有效，提出的 RealBench 数据集也有助于评估与提升泛化性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证/修正机制在开源小模型上不稳定，难以在困难任务上获得可靠的长篇推理；需要一种可在弱验证下也能自进化的推理框架。

Method: 将迭代推理建模为马可夫链，从而，在多条长时程自进化过程并行运行，若改进概率略大于退化概率，即可逐步收敛到正确解；通过多进程并行放大微小的正向趋势。

Result: 在 AIME 2024-2025 基准上解决 5/9 原本不可解的问题，提升整体表现，且通过多数投票让该 8B 模型超越其 600B 参数教师在单轮推理的准确度。

Conclusion: DSER 不仅提升了当前模型的推理能力，也用于诊断现有自我验证和修正的局限，指向未来需要具备强大内生自进化能力的下一代模型，并为研究下一代自进化能力提供研究议程。

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

Motivation: 跨语言句子嵌入研究尚不充分，需在单语言与跨语言信号之间取得平衡；通过整合 MLM、TLM、双编码器翻译排序和 additive margin softmax，降低对大量平行数据的依赖。

Method: 将masked language modeling (MLM)、translation language modeling (TLM)、dual encoder translation ranking与additive margin softmax相结合，利用预训练的多语言模型；在109+语言上训练，利用CommonCrawl挖掘平行数据以提升NMT潜力；在Tatoeba评估跨语言句子嵌入与检索性能，并公开模型。

Result: 在Tatoeba上实现83.7%的双文本检索准确率，覆盖112种语言，显著高于LASER的65.5；在单语言迁移任务仍具竞争力；利用该模型从CommonCrawl挖掘的平行数据可训练出与En-Zh、En-De等语言对具竞争力的NMT模型；公开发布109+语言的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 引入预训练的多语言语言模型可显著降低平行数据需求（约80%），通过结合多种策略实现强大的跨语言句子嵌入，同时兼顾单语言迁移表现，为大规模多语言NLP提供实用嵌入模型与数据资源。

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

*Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Minghao Tang,Jingtong Wu,Zengxin Han,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EliCal: a two-stage framework that first elicits internal confidence via self-consistency and then calibrates it with a small set of correctness annotations; introduces HonestyBench for large-scale study; achieves near-optimal honesty alignment with only 1k correctness annotations and outperforms calibration-only baselines on unseen tasks, offering a scalable path to universal honesty alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current honesty alignment methods either use training-free confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or require costly, large-scale correctness annotations for training-based calibration. There is a need for annotation-efficient, scalable alignment.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) elicitation stage uses inexpensive self-consistency supervision to extract internal confidence; (2) calibration stage uses a small set of correctness annotations to calibrate this confidence. The authors also release HonestyBench, a large benchmark (ten free-form QA datasets, 560k training + 70k evaluation instances) with correctness and self-consistency signals.

Result: EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment using only 1k correctness annotations (about 0.18% of full supervision) and shows better alignment on unseen MMLU tasks compared to a calibration-only baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed EliCal framework provides an annotation-efficient path toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs and is supported by a large-scale benchmark for robust evaluation.

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

*Tiancheng Hu,Joachim Baumann,Lorenzo Lupo,Dirk Hovy,Nigel Collier,Paul Röttger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimBench 作为首个大规模、标准化的 LLM 行为仿真基准，用以统一评估从道德决策到经济选择的20套数据集，覆盖全球参与者；结果显示当前模型在仿真能力方面仍受限，且随模型规模提升而呈对数线性增长，推理时间增量对仿真无显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估碎片化，缺乏可比性，需要一个统一、可重复的基准来系统研究 LLM 仿真行为的成败因素。

Method: 整合 20 个数据集，覆盖道德决策、经济选择等任务，涵盖全球参与者；评估多种语言模型的仿真表现，分析模型尺寸、推理时间、指令微调、对不同人口群体的仿真；并考察与深度推理能力（如 MMLU-Pro）的相关性。

Result: 最佳模型仿真能力分数为 40.80/100；仿真性能随模型规模呈对数线性增长；增加推理时间无显著提升；存在对齐-仿真的折衷：指令微调在低熵问题上提升，在高熵问题上下降；模拟特定人口群体尤为困难；仿真能力与深度知识推理能力（MMLU-Pro，r=0.939）相关性最强。

Conclusion: 通过可测量的进展促进更忠实的 LLM 仿真器开发；统一基准有助于推动社会与行为科学对 LLM 仿真的科学研究。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个多任务学习框架，将自回归大型语言模型与临床推理对齐，用于MSK-CHORD数据集的肿瘤治疗结局预测；比较三种对齐策略：普通有监督微调(SFT)、带链式推理CoT的SFT以及GRPO强化学习对齐；CoT提升F1约+6.0、MAE下降约12%；GRPO在BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore等指标上实现可解释性与预测性能的最新水平；指出现有生物医学领域的LLM在生成有效推理轨迹方面存在架构性限制；确立可解释、可信的精密肿瘼治疗LLM的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异质性临床数据下，需要既高效又可解释的预测模型来支撑癌症治疗的决策。尽管LLMs在生物医学NLP中表现良好，但缺乏在高风险场景中所需的结构化推理能力。

Method: 联合学习将二元生存分类、连续生存时间回归与自然语言推理生成结合起来；评估三种对齐策略：SFT、带CoT的SFT、GRPO；使用LLaMa3-8B与Med42-8B进行实验，评估指标包括F1、MAE、BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore等。

Result: CoT在F1上提升约6.0、MAE下降约12%；GRPO在解释性和预测性能上达到或超越现有方法，在BLEU/ROUGE/BERTScore等方面表现出色；并指出现有生物医学LLM难以产生有效的推理轨迹，这与架构限制相关。

Conclusion: 强调推理感知对多任务临床建模的重要性，为精准肿瘤学领域提供可解释、可信的LLM新基准。

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

TL;DR: 用拓扑数据分析揭示微调后模型在处理歧义时的隐藏几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标量指标难以捕捉歧义在模型内部的表示，需新视角。

Method: 应用 Mapper（拓扑数据分析工具）到 RoBERTa-Large 在 MD-Offense 数据集的嵌入层，分析决策区域、边界和聚簇结构。

Result: 超过98% 的连通分量具有≥90% 的预测纯度；但在模糊数据中与真实标签的对齐下降，揭示结构置信度与标签不确定性之间的张力；Mapper 能揭示边界崩塌、过度自信聚簇等几何特征，PCA/UMAP 无法直接捕捉。

Conclusion: Mapper 是理解模型如何解决歧义的有力诊断工具，且可促进在主观 NLP 任务中的建模策略。

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

*Collin Zhang,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Language Confusion Gate（LCG），一个轻量的解码阶段插件，降低语言混淆且不显著损害任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在文本生成中无意地混用语言的问题；现有方案要么重训模型，要么无法区分有害的混淆与可接受的代码切换，需更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 通过 norm-adjusted self-distillation 训练 LCG，预测合适的语言族并在需要时对输出 token 进行屏蔽；基于若干观察：语言混淆发生概率低、正确语言的高概率通常在前列、输出嵌入向量的范数对高资源语言较大，从而偏置采样。

Result: 在 Qwen3、GPT-OSS、Gemma3、Llama3.1 等多种模型上，LCG 显著降低语言混淆，常达一个数量级或更大，同时对任务性能没有负面影响。

Conclusion: LCG 作为插件式解决方案，可在现有大模型上应用，具备广泛可用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出LawChain三模块推理框架并建立LawChain_eval评估基准，用于在中国民事侵权案件中的法律推理分析，评估大模型在民事侵权情境下的法律推理能力，提出基线方法融入LawChain式推理，且在其他法律分析任务中具备迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补现有计算法学对一般推理框架的不足，缺乏对民事侵权案件中细粒度推理过程的建模与解释，以及对现有刑事导向研究的局限；提升对法律推理链条的可解析性与模型在民事司法场景中的适用性。

Method: 将法律推理过程形式化为LawChain三模块架构，每个模块含多步子过程；据此构建LawChain_eval评估基准以系统评估推理链的关键步骤；通过提示设计或后训练等基线方法将LawChain风格的推理融入大语言模型，且在额外法律分析任务（如法律命名实体识别、刑事损害赔偿等）上测试泛化性。

Result: 实验表明当前大模型在民事侵权法律推理中的关键要素处理仍显不足；引入LawChain风格的基线方法后，在侵权相关推理任务上获得显著提升，并具备对相关法律分析任务的迁移性。

Conclusion: 显式建模法律推理链有助于提升语言模型的法律分析能力与可解释性，并具备较好的跨任务推广潜力。

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning
chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估六种最先进的去学习方法，发现它们在情境中使用被遗忘知识的能力上存在显著下降。提出在去学习目标中加入一个插件项，以保留在上下文中出现时对被遗忘知识的利用能力。实验表明，该方法在保持遗忘效果与 retain-set 性能的同时，能显著恢复上下文利用性至近原水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型可能包含敏感或过时信息，需要高效的去学习来确保合规性，同时保持模型的总体效用。现有评估多关注对目标知识的遗忘程度（forget set）和 retain-set 的实用性，忽略在提示中重新引入信息时的上下文利用性。

Method: 对六种最先进的去学习方法进行系统评估；在去学习目标的优化目标中加入一个插件项，旨在在上下文中出现被遗忘知识时仍然保持对该知识的使用能力；通过大规模实验验证该方法在多种数据和设置下的有效性。

Result: 引入插件项后，情境利用性接近原始水平的水平恢复，同时仍能保持对遗忘目标和 retain-set 的良好性能。

Conclusion: 强调上下文利用性是实际应用中不可忽视的维度；通过在去学习目标中加入插件式约束，能够在保护隐私与合规的同时维持模型的实用性，填补评估中的空白。

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

pipeline spanning bilingual continued pre-training, instruction tuning, and
alignment from human preferences. Newly accessible Irish corpora and English
text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving

Result: 生成的题目在难度与质量上超越 GPT-4o；对 Qwen3-8B-base 在 100K 高难度题目的微调后，性能超过原始模型在 LiveCodeBench；再增加 112K 示例（28K 人类题目配对多解），8B 模型达到 DeepSeek-R1-671B 的水平。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的高难度题目生成，QueST 提供一种有效且可扩展的途径，推动大语言模型在竞争性编码与推理任务上的能力边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks,
solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability
is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级的少-shot NER 框架，通过两项创新提升在低资源场景中的泛化能力与数据利用：一是简化的输出格式和输出模板，结合大语言模型的长上下文窗口；二是对上下文进行语义保留的同义改写数据增强。实验表明在少-shot/零-shot任务上接近状态-of-the-art，且在 CrossNER 上平均达到 80.1 的 F1 分数；基于改写的训练显著提升，达到对比基线提升高达 17 点的 F1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源场景下，NER 需要大量标注数据，标注成本高；现有的零-shot/指令调优方法虽有进展，但往往对领域特定实体泛化不足，且未能充分利用有限数据。

Method: 提出两项关键创新：1) 设计新的指令调优模板，输出格式简化，结合早期 IT 方法的要点以利用近来大型语言模型的长上下文能力；2) 引入一种数据增强策略，通过对周围上下文进行同义改写来扩增数据，同时保持实体信息与语义关系不被破坏。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验显示，该方法在少-shot与零-shot任务上可达到与 SOTA 相当的性能；在 CrossNER 数据集上，少-shot 方法的平均 F1 达到 80.1；基于改写的训练在与基线相比时，F1 提升幅度可达 最高约 17 点。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限的 NER 任务提供了一种高效可扩展的解决思路，尤其是在计算资源受限的场景中表现突出，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

Motivation: 当前长上下文基准普遍面临上下文长度受限、标注工作量大以及训练过程中的标签泄露等挑战，难以全面评估模型在真实长文场景中的推理与生成能力。

Method: 以 arXiv 的论文为材料，构建包含 Title、Abstract、Introduction、Related Work 等多层抽象等级的长上下文写作任务，且不需要人工标注；引入来自合著者图的高质量少-shot 演示以实现灵活的上下文长度；通过实时（live）评估避免标签泄露。

Result: 对 AcademicEval 进行全面评估，发现 LLM 在处理具有层级抽象级别的任务时表现较差，并且在处理较长的少量示例演示时存在挑战。分析还揭示了提升长上下文建模能力的若干线索。

Conclusion: 该基准为长上下文能力的评估提供了新的挑战性平台，有助于推动对模型在长文理解与生成方面的改进，代码公开可获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

*Tong Chen,Akari Asai,Luke Zettlemoyer,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Faeze Brahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种在线强化学习方法，使用二进制检索增强奖励（RAR），仅在输出完全事实正确时给予奖励，显著降低外在幻觉且不损害开放式生成、指令遵循、数学与代码等能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性强化与纠错方法往往在提升事实性的同时削弱开放式生成质量或下游任务表现，存在明显的权衡，因此需要一个能够在不牺牲其他能力的前提下提升事实性的训练信号。

Method: 提出基于在线强化学习的二进制奖励信号RAR，输出仅在完全事实正确时获得奖励1，否则为0；结合检索增强机制以提升事实性判断，评估对象为Qwen3系列模型，在开放式生成与简短问答场景中进行实验，且模型在简短问答中学会有条件 abstention（如输出“我不知道”）。

Result: 开放式生成中幻觉率降低39.3%，明显优于 supervised 训练和持续奖励RL基线。在简短问答方面，PopQA与GPQA的错误答案分别减少44.4%与21.7%。此外，这些事实性提升并未损害指令遵循、数学或代码能力；相比之下，持续奖励RL尽管提高事实性，但会带来质量下降。

Conclusion: 二进制RAR在提升事实性方面具有优势，可在不牺牲其他能力的前提下实现更安全的输出，并鼓励模型在知识不足时选择拒答以避免错误。

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

*Austin Xu,Xuan-Phi Nguyen,Yilun Zhou,Chien-Sheng Wu,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过2.5M数据规模的监督微调，FARE在8B/20B参数规模上成为开源评估模型的新标杆，数据驱动优于仅靠RL的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在评估任务日益复杂、需要更大规模且可扩展的评估方法背景下，单靠RL训练评估器难以充分利用海量数据，因此需要数据规模驱动的发展。

Method: 构建2.5M样本数据集，覆盖五类评估任务与多领域，训练8B和20B参数的FARE，通过迭代的拒绝采样监督微调(SFT)。

Result: FARE-8B在与更大规模的专属RL评估器竞争时表现优越；FARE-20B设立开源评估新标准，超过70B+的专用评估器；在现实任务中，作为推理时重排序器，FARE-20B在MATH任务上接近Oracle性能；作为RL训练中的验证器，FARE帮助下游RL模型性能提升最多14.1%；以FARE初始化并持续微调的FARE-Code在测试用例质量评估上比gpt-oss-20B高65%。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的大规模微调可实现高性能、开源可获取的评估器，数据规模与简化的SFT流程可超越以RL为主的训练范式，提升评估器对下游任务的实际帮助和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

TL;DR: Proposes Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular knowledge base that integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain knowledge from literature to improve automated AI research replication; shows ~10.9% gain on PaperBench with o3-mini; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicating AI research is crucial but challenging due to insufficient background knowledge, limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in capturing latent technical details, missing implementation-level signals, and lack of structured, multi-granular knowledge representations.

Method: Introduce xKG as a modular/pluggable knowledge base that automatically extracts and integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain knowledge from scientific literature; integrate xKG into three agent frameworks with two LLMs; evaluate on PaperBench.

Result: xKG delivers substantial performance gains (about 10.9%) on PaperBench when combined with o3-mini, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication.

Conclusion: xKG provides a general, extensible framework for automated AI research replication; code will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible
solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at
https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VisuoAlign 通过基于提示的树搜索框架，将安全约束嵌入多模态推理过程，结合视觉-文本交互提示和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）构建多样的安全关键提示轨迹，并通过提示扩展实现实时风险检测与合规输出，显著提升 LVLM 的鲁棒性和数据集生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型在多模态输入下的安全对齐问题。现有防御易受多模态越狱攻击、推理链缺乏安全监督、跨模态融合时对齐退化等影响，亟需主动暴露风险、系统化探索安全提示轨迹，并实现对推理过程的安全约束嵌入。

Method: 提出 VisuoAlign：通过视觉-文本交互提示在推理中嵌入安全约束；使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）系统性构建多样的安全关键提示轨迹；引入基于提示的扩展以实现对风险的实时检测与合规响应。

Result: 大量实验表明 VisuoAlign 能主动暴露风险、支持高效数据集生成，并显著提升 LVLM 对复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign 提供了一种可扩展的多模态安全对齐框架，能够主动发现风险并实现更鲁棒、合规的多模态对话系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

### [87] [Executable Epistemology: The Structured Cognitive Loop as an Architecture of Intentional Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15952)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结构化认知循环（SCL）作为一个可执行的认识论框架，将智能从单纯的统计表现转向在特定条件下的认知过程重现；通过分离的功能结构实现更可解释的行为，并将智能重新定义为自我重建其认知状态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型缺乏真正的 epistemic 理解，暴露出缺乏系统的 epistemic 架构的核心问题；需要将哲学洞见转化为可计算的结构，并通过“执行中的认识论”来探究认知何以在特定条件下涌现。

Method: 以心灵哲学、认知现象学为基础，结合过程哲学、行动性认知、扩展心灵等理论，将智能定义为一个持续的判断—记忆—控制—行动—调控的循环；将哲学洞见结构化为可计算的可解释组件，实现“可执行的认识论”；通过对比评估（agent evaluations）验证分离式架构的优势。

Result: 提出的分离式认知架构在实现上比单一的提示驱动系统更具连贯性与可解释性，且通过对构成要素的感知与互动验证，支持“可执行的认识论”的有效性；智能被重新定义为对自身 epistemic 状态的重构能力，而非单纯的表征准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架在哲学、认知科学与人工智能之间架起桥梁：为哲学提供可执行的理论测试平台；为 AI 将行为建立在 epistemic 结构之上；为认识论提供以连续重构为核心的知识观。作者主张进步不在于更大的模型，而在于实现认知原则的结构性架构。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader
ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为 Tower of Hanoi 的环境接口实验表明，给定工具移动与状态观察，LLM 的性能崩溃并未被工具化过程解决，且策略分析显示模型在复杂度层级呈现模式化崩溃，与最佳策略和全随机策略均有偏离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究 LRMs 崩溃现象是否源于任务结构/状态跟踪的难题，以及工具化推理是否提升真实推理能力。

Method: 为 LLM 提供 Tower of Hanoi 的环境接口，允许通过工具调用移动、给出书面理由、观测状态、再提示下一步；同时对 LLM 参数化策略进行分析，与最优策略和随机策略对比。

Result: 环境接口并未延迟或消除崩溃；参数化策略显示从最优到全随机的偏离增大，表明在每个复杂度等级上存在模式化崩溃，表现取决于该模式是否对应正确解。

Conclusion: 该现象可能也存在于 LRMs 中，需要重新审视 LRMs 的推理能力与工具使用的关系，以及崩溃背后的模式化本质。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 ProofFlow：一种以结构保真度为核心的自动形式化管线，使用 DAG 表示推理依赖，以引理为中间步骤，并提供新基准和 ProofScore，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言定理和证明翻译成机器可验证代码的同时，保留原证明的语义和逻辑结构，以提高可验证性和再现性。

Method: 构建 ProofFlow 管线，先用 DAG 表示证明步骤之间的逻辑依赖，再通过以引理为中间目标的分步形式对每一步进行形式化；提供 184 道本科层级题目的基准数据，并提出 ProofScore 指标评估句法正确性、语义保真度和结构保真度。

Result: 在 autoformalization 任务上达到新的状态量化指标 ProofScore=0.545，显著超越基线如 full-proof formalization (0.123) 与 step-proof formalization (0.072)。

Conclusion: 该管线、基准和评分体系开源，促进进一步进展。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

Abstract: An essential component for evaluating and comparing physical and cognitive
capabilities between populations is the testing of various factors related to
human performance. As a core part of sports science research, testing motor
performance enables the analysis of the physical health of different
demographic groups and makes them comparable.
  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于非重叠的冲突度量，用于随机排列集(RPS)的冲突分析，并将RPST视为DST的扩展，结合RBO灵感的排列不一致性度量，支持Top权重和可调参数/截断深度，适用于RFS与DST两种视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要利用顺序信息进行不确定性融合的场景中，迫切需要衡量两条证据之间的冲突强度。RPST将有序信息引入焦集，因此需要新的冲突度量以充分体现顺序特性并兼容DST与RFS框架。

Method: 从排列出发，定义受Rank-Biased Overlap启发的排列不一致性度量；提出一种基于非重叠部分的RPS冲突度量；将RPST视为DST的扩展，利用焦集中的顺序权重（顶级元素的关键性）设计可调权重、参数和截断深度；通过数值示例评估度量的性质和可用性。

Result: 该方法具有自然的Top加权特性，并在数值示例中展示了RPS中的冲突行为与特性；从DST视角也能有效表征冲突，并为决策者提供灵活的权重、参数与截断深度设置。

Conclusion: 提出的非重叠冲突度量为RPS提供了在有序信息背景下的冲突分析工具，理论上具备良好性质并具备实际应用的灵活性；RPST作为DST扩展，便于在决策中更好地处理顺序信息。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

*Changhao Wang,Yanfang Liu,Xinxin Fan,Anzhi Zhou,Lao Tian,Yunfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个双轨KG验证与推理框架 DTKG，面向多跳问答，通过并行事实验证与链式推理的双通路，结合两阶段流程（分类阶段与分支处理阶段）提升推理能力与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多跳推理面临两类问题：一方面基于LLM的并行事实验证在并行场景表现良好但对链式推理欠佳；另一方面基于知识图谱的路径检索在链式推理上强，但在并行事实验证时存在冗余检索、效率低下。需要一个能够兼顾两类推理模式且提升效率与准确性的框架。

Method: 提出DTKG（双轨KG验证与推理框架），受认知科学中的双过程理论启发，包含Classification Stage（分类阶段）与Branch Processing Stage（分支处理阶段），将并行事实验证与链式推理分路处理，并通过知识图图结构进行关系检索与推理。

Result: 原文摘要未给出具体实验结果或定量指标。

Conclusion: DTKG通过双阶段设计实现对并行与链式推理的协同处理，为多跳问答提供一种新的框架发展方向。

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

Motivation: 工业环境中常见强噪声干扰与域漂移叠加，导致传统迁移/跨域故障诊断效果下降。需要同时抑制噪声干扰、实现域不变表征的跨域传输方法。

Method: 建立信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进的正交损失以解耦域不变的故障表征；引入全球-聚焦域对抗机制，约束条件分布和边际分布。聚焦对抗缓解无监督场景中因噪声引起的类别特定传输障碍，全球域分类器对齐整体分布。

Result: 在三个公开基准数据集上进行实验，ISGFAN相较多种强基线表现更优，证实框架的鲁棒性与有效性。

Conclusion: 信息分离结合全局-聚焦对抗学习能在带噪声和域差异的场景下提升跨域故障诊断的传输鲁棒性，数据与代码开放。

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Few-shot prompting with Gold-Standard Depth and Representative Diversity yields higher reliability of LLM-generated clinical CoTs in ART; Random Few-shot ineffective; human evaluation remains essential; Dual Principles framework proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in clinical CoT generation; need to assess reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and optimal prompting strategies; compare Zero-shot, Random Few-shot, and Selective Few-shot with expert and AI evaluation.

Method: Blinded comparative study; senior ART clinicians evaluated CoTs generated under three prompting strategies; compared with GPT-4o evaluation; metrics included multiple human evaluations; statistical significance p<.001 for Selective vs others.

Result: Selective Few-shot outperformed others across all human metrics; Random Few-shot showed no significant improvement over Zero-shot.

Conclusion: Prompt curation is critical; Dual Principles: Gold-Standard Depth and Representative Diversity; human expertise essential for evaluating high-stakes clinical AI; proposed framework for scalable trustworthy data.

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个以动态能力为核心的新框架，将企业知识量化为可审计的度量，用以应对 AI 中介下的企业决策责任。核心是连续知识指标 S_S(φ)、阈值知识谓词 K_S、以及企业级认知容量 K_{S,t}，并将其映射到实际知识、构成性知识、纵容性盲点与鲁莽等法律标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式人工智能日益介入企业决策的背景下，传统的“mens rea/知悉”假设受到挑战。需要可度量、可法律审查的企业认知框架，以实现算法时代的问责。

Method: 基于扩展认知理论，提出一个 formal 模型，定义连续的组织知识度量 S_S(φ)，将管线的计算成本与经统计验证的误差率整合；推导阈值知识谓词 K_S 及企业范围的认知容量指标 K_{S,t}，并将这些量化指标映射到实际知识、构成性知识、故意盲从和鲁莽等法律标准，最后提出可操作的审计产物。

Result: 给出一个可操作的数量化框架：S_S(φ)、K_S、K_{S,t}，以及它们与法律标准的映射路径，提供向可证据化审计 artefacts 的转化蓝图。

Conclusion: 该框架为在算法驱动的企业环境中，使“企业心智”可量化、可问责化提供理论与方法基础，促成可司法化的审计工具与流程。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

*Alex Zhavoronkov,Dominika Wilczok,Roman Yampolskiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出“被记住权”（RTBR），以缓解LLM在信息记忆中的偏见与缺失，防止少数叙事被放大、被遗忘的群体被排除，强调减少信息遗漏、保障公正对待并提升生成内容的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的综合回答可能压缩多元观点，削弱用户比较不同选项的能力，导致信息记忆的权力集中在少数厂商，进而影响公共叙事和被记忆对象的存在。

Method: 概念性分析与框架提出：界定RTBR的权利与义务，讨论在信息检索与生成式AI场景中的应用原则，提出实现RTBR的设计与治理方向（非实验性描述）。

Result: 提出RTBR框架，明确减少信息遗漏、保障公平对待、并确保输出尽量真实；为后续研究提供方向。

Conclusion: RTBR为抵抗AI驱动的记忆偏差和信息支配提供道德与治理框架，强调在未来的信息生态中维护多样性与透明度。

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScholarEval is a retrieval-augmented evaluation framework for research ideas using two criteria (soundness and contribution) and is supported by ScholarIdeas, an expert-annotated dataset; it outperforms baselines in rubric coverage and usefulness and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust, domain-spanning evaluation of AI-generated research ideas that aligns with human expert rubrics; existing methods lack multi-domain annotated data and comprehensive coverage of rubric criteria.

Method: Introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval-augmented evaluation framework with two criteria: soundness (empirical validity from literature) and contribution (advancement over prior work). Develop ScholarIdeas, an expert-annotated dataset of 117 ideas across AI, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Compare ScholarEval to baselines (including o4-mini-deep-research) using rubric coverage and actionability; perform a large-scale user study.

Result: ScholarEval shows higher coverage of rubric-points than all baselines; it is consistently preferred over o4-mini-deep-research in actionability, depth, and evidence. The large user study indicates better performance than deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness.

Conclusion: ScholarEval is effective for robust evaluation of research ideas and, with its open-source code, dataset, and tool, can be adopted and extended by the research community.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

TL;DR: 提出并系统分析了“推理分心”漏洞：无关但复杂任务通过提示注入可显著削弱大型推理模型的推理输出，并给出基于SFT+RL的对抗训练以提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型在数学和编程等复杂任务中展现长链推理能力，推理分心成为影响可靠性的新风险点。

Method: 在多种模型和基准上进行系统实验，分析注入的分心任务对性能的影响，研究对齐策略的作用及潜在的 covert compliance，并提出防御训练：对抗数据上进行监督微调（SFT）与强化学习（RL）相结合。

Result: 注入的分心干扰可将任务准确度降低高达60%，某些对齐方法甚至放大此弱点；模型可能展示 covert compliance；通过SFT+RL的对抗训练，面对分心攻击的鲁棒性提升超过50个点。

Conclusion: 推理分心是LRM可靠性的一种明确且紧迫的威胁，所提防御为实现更安全、可信的推理系统提供了切实可行的路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A compact typed knowledge graph MedRule-KG with a symbolic verifier enforces mathematical rules in LLM reasoning; improves exact-match on an FDA-derived task, achieving perfect EM with verification and eliminates rule violations; provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning with released code/data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce fluent but rule-violating reasoning. There is a need for interpretable, formally constrained reasoning, especially for mathematical/logical tasks in sensitive domains like medicine.

Method: Construct MedRule-KG as a compact typed knowledge graph encoding entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules. A symbolic verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee consistency.

Result: On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900; adding the verifier yields EM of 1.000 and eliminates all rule violations.

Conclusion: MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning; the authors discuss ablations and release code and data to promote reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while

MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

*Tong Zhang,Ru Zhang,Jianyi Liu,Zhen Yang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SELECT: a dynamic, two-stage anchor discovery framework for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models that uses Sibling-Exclusive Concepts to avoid fixed-anchor issues like re-emergence and erosion, achieving ~4s per concept and compatibility with multiple erasure methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed anchors in current concept erasure methods cause re-emergence/erosion and are insensitive to anchor choice. Causal tracing reveals anchor sensitivity and introduces Sibling Exclusive Concepts as superior anchors. A dynamic, automatic anchor discovery is needed to robustly erase concepts while preserving related ones.

Method: Proposes SELECT (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a two-stage evaluation framework. Stage 1 discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure; Stage 2 identifies critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts. Introduces Sibling-Exclusive Concepts as anchors and demonstrates SELECT as a universal anchor solution adaptable to multiple erasure frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments show SELECT consistently outperforms existing baselines on key metrics, and can mine anchors for a single concept in ~4 seconds.

Conclusion: SELECT provides a universal, efficient anchor discovery solution for contextual targeting in diffusion-based erasure, mitigating fixed-anchor limitations and enabling robust erasure across frameworks with fast anchor mining.

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个带有系统2/系统1的用户-算法互动模型，作为多领导-单 follower 的广义Stackelberg博弈；存在一个关键的对齐时域阈值，前瞻的用户可以实现对齐，微小的额外信号成本可显著降低该阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释在信息推荐/对话系统等互动场景中，用户的短期偏好与长期价值之间的偏离如何影响算法对齐，以及如何通过设计信号来促进对齐。

Method: 建立一个分为理性系统2和冲动系统1的用户决策模型；将用户视为多领导者、单跟随者的广义Stackelberg博弈，算法基于观测到的互动进行最优回应，研究实现对齐所需的最小对齐时域（临界 horizon）。

Result: 证明存在一个临界 horizon：足够有前瞻性的用户能够实现与其真实利益的一致性对齐；而缺乏前瞻性的用户会被对齐到算法的目标而非自身兴趣；该临界 horizon 可能相当长，但引入一个小的、带成本的信号（例如额外一次点击）即可显著降低该 horizon。

Conclusion: 提供一个解释框架，揭示在以参与度为驱动的算法中，具有不一致偏好的用户如何在 Stackelberg 均衡中实现对齐，并指出设计信号与代价措施对提升对齐性的潜在应用与策略。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

TL;DR: HSCM: a humanoid-inspired structural causal model that models fine-grained causal mechanisms to improve domain generalization, outperforming DG models; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional domain generalization (DG) models rely on statistical data-label dependencies and distortion-invariant representations, often lacking causal interpretability and robustness. The authors motivate this work by aiming to mimic human vision's hierarchical processing to capture underlying causal mechanisms and improve transfer across diverse domains.

Method: Propose the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a hierarchical, multi-level causal framework that disentangles and reweights key image attributes (color, texture, shape) to model fine-grained causal relationships. Combines theoretical analysis with empirical evaluations; code available at GitHub.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evaluations show that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, offering improved robustness and interpretability in causal modeling for vision tasks.

Conclusion: HSCM provides a principled approach to capturing causal relationships, enhancing generalization in dynamic environments and enabling more effective transfer learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在 NP-hard 优化和复杂推理任务上的能力仍不充分研究，需要一个可扩展、可验证的 RLVR 框架来提升推理能力并系统评估模型在这类任务上的表现。

Method: 提出 NP-ENGINE：涵盖 10 项任务、5 大领域；每项配备可控实例生成器、基于规则的验证器、提供近似最优解的启发式求解器，形成一个生成-验证-求解的管线，支持分层难度与可扩展的 RLVR 训练；基于此数据源构建 NP-BENCH，聚焦 NP-hard 等级的推理与解质量评估；通过零 RLVR 与课程学习在 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct 上训练 QWEN2.5-7B-NP；并在多任务/跨域场景下评估泛化与推理能力。

Result: QLEN2.5-7B-NP 在 NP-BENCH 上显著优于 GPT-4o，达到相同模型规模的 SOTA；RLVR 基于 NP-ENGINE-DATA 的训练促使对 NP-hard 推理的强健性与 OOD 泛化提升，扩展到逻辑、谜题、数学等推理任务及指令遵循等非推理任务；任务多样性提升了 OOD 泛化，揭示了 RLVR 的规模效应与规律。

Conclusion: 任务丰富的 RLVR 训练是提升 LLM 推理能力的有希望方向，提供了在 NP-hard 领域系统评估和学习的框架，并揭示了 RLVR 的扩展规律与跨域泛化潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

Conclusion: BuildArena delivers a versatile, extensible platform to study and compare LLMs in physics-grounded construction tasks, aiming to advance understanding and progress in language-driven engineering construction.

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language
specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated
reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM
agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On
eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities
for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project

TL;DR: GraphFlow通过转移式流式匹配，联合优化检索策略与流估计器，将奖励分解到中间检索状态，促使从文本丰富的知识图中按奖励分布检索，从而获得高质量且多样化的知识。实验表明在STaRK基准上对比强基线提升约10%的命中率与召回率，并具备对未见知识图的良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图的检索增强生成在文本丰富的KG中难以获得准确且多样的信息，且基于过程级奖励的监督信号成本高、难以获取。需要一个高效的检索框架，使检索结果更贴合查询需求。

Method: 提出GraphFlow，通过转移-based flow matching的目标，同时优化检索策略与流估计器；将检索结果的奖励分解到中间检索状态，使检索策略根据中间状态的奖励进行候选选择，从而在KG中实现高质量且多样化的检索。评估在STaRK数据集上，显示对未见KG的良好泛化。

Result: GraphFlow在STaRK上相对强基线（包括GPT-4o）在命中率与召回率方面平均提升约10%，并展现出对 unseen KG 的鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphFlow为KG-RAG提供了一种高效、鲁棒的检索框架，通过奖励分解和流式策略优化实现与查询需求的对齐，提升检索的准确性与多样性，同时降低对昂贵过程级监督的依赖。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

### [108] [Uncertain Knowledge Graph Completion via Semi-Supervised Confidence Distribution Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16601)
*Tianxing Wu,Shutong Zhu,Jingting Wang,Ning Xu,Guilin Qi,Haofen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semi-supervised method ssCDL for UKG completion that converts triple confidences into confidence distributions, leveraging labeled and pseudo-labeled data via meta-learning to rebalance confidence distributions, improving UKG completion over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world uncertain knowledge graphs are incomplete and exhibit highly imbalanced confidence distributions among triples, which degrades embedding learning and completion performance.

Method: Convert each triple's confidence into a confidence distribution; train embeddings using both labeled triples and unlabeled unseen triples with pseudo labels generated by meta-learning; iteratively refine embeddings and rebalance the confidence distribution.

Result: ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two UKG datasets across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: Transforming confidences into distributions and employing semi-supervised learning with meta-learned pseudo labels effectively improves UKG completion and addresses confidence imbalance.

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: 提出 MERCI，一种在 LLM 推理中引入基于计数的内在奖励的探索方法，通过轻量级的 Coin Flipping Network 估计伪计数及推理轨迹的不确定性，将新颖性纳入学习信号，提升多步推理表现并打破局部循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习对 LLM 推理的探索往往依赖稀疏的结果奖励且探索受限，容易导致重复且次优的推理模式；需要更系统的内在动机来促使大语言模型在推理链路上进行更丰富的探索。

Method: 提出 MERCI，基于基于计数的探索理念，使用 Coin Flipping Network（CFN）估计伪计数与推理轨迹的不确定性，并将其转化为内在奖励，鼓励新颖性，同时保留任务奖励信号；将 MERCI 融入像 GRPO 这样的先进 RL 框架。

Result: 在复杂推理基准上，MERCI 能促使模型生成更丰富多样的推理链，显著优于强基线，帮助策略摆脱局部模式并发现更优解。

Conclusion: 有针对性的内在动机可以使对语言模型推理的探索更加可靠，MERCI 为 LLM 推理的探索提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

Motivation: 解决LLMs的静态知识、事实幻觉和检索能力不足的问题；传统RAG单步/启发式，缺乏自适应检索与推理控制；agentic search结合RL可实现多步计划、检索与反思。

Conclusion: RL驱动的agentic search有望提升可靠性、可扩展性和自适应能力，但仍需解决鲁棒性、数据效率、评估标准等挑战。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 ELMM，用多视角视觉令牌压缩（MVTC）和注意力裁剪，提升多模态知识图谱完成（MKGC）的效率与性能，在 FB15k-237-IMG、WN18-IMG 上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态知识图谱通过视觉和文本扩展实体表示，但普遍存在不完整性、模态噪声、模态冲突及高计算成本等问题，亟需高效的 MKGC 方案来充分利用视觉与文本信息。

Method: 提出 MVTC：基于多头注意力，自适应地从文本与视觉视角压缩图像 token，降低冗余并减轻模态冲突；引入注意力裁剪策略，去除冗余注意力层以降低推理成本；通过线性投影补偿裁剪带来的性能下降。

Result: 在 FB15k-237-IMG 与 WN18-IMG 上实现了SOTA水平，同时显著提升推理效率，展现了多模态知识图谱完成的新范式。

Conclusion: ELMM 通过 token 压缩和模型裁剪实现准确性与效率的良好折中，确立了 MKGC 的新基线，体现了多模态信息在高效推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 ELLSA：端到端的 Listen, Look, Speak and Act 全双工多模态模型，在单一架构中同时感知与生成视觉、文本、语音与动作，实现对话与行动等高级多模态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实的人机交互本质上是多模态、双向且需要灵活的转接（turn-taking）与中断处理。现有方法往往局限于单一模态或离线分阶段流程，难以实现自然、通用的交互行为。

Method: 提出 SA-MoE（自注意力专家混合）架构，对每种模态路由到专门的专家并在统一的注意力骨干中融合；结合强大预训练组件，实现端到端的感知与生成的跨模态协同，并提高模态间干扰的鲁棒性。通过该架构，ELL SA 同时支持视觉、文本、语音与动作的联合推理与生成。

Result: 在语音交互与机器人操控基准上，ELL SA 的表现与专门模态基线相当；并且独特地支持多模态的全双工行为，如对话与行动转接、拒绝无效指令、说-做同现、上下文感知的视觉问答以及行动被逼入等情境，展示更自然、通用的互动能力。研究还计划在接受后公开数据、代码与模型检查点。

Conclusion: ELL SA 代表向更自然、更通用的交互智能迈出的一步，为实现更广义的人工通用智能提供了新的研究路径。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了 CDC（Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph），将领域作为动态分类维度的一等公民，通过 C-D-C 三元组<Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'>实现上下文感知推理和跨域类比，使用 Prolog 实现并在教育、企业知识系统和技术文档中给出案例，超越传统本体框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱受限于固定本体，将领域视为隐式上下文而非显式、推理级的组成部分；需要将域引入推理层以实现动态、上下文敏感的知识建模。

Method: 提出 C-D-C 三元组<Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'>；域规范作为按需动态分类维度；基于认知-语言映射原理，将人们对概念的理解放入上下文框架；正式化20+种关系谓词（结构、逻辑、跨域、时序）；在 Prolog 中实现以支持完整推理。

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和技术文档的案例中，CDC 展现出上下文感知推理、跨域类比和个性化知识建模等能力，传统本体框架难以达到。

Conclusion: CDC 将域提升为推理级别的一等公民，促进上下文敏感的跨域理解和推理；具有广泛应用潜力，但需要进一步形式化、扩展验证与大规模评估。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

TL;DR: ToolCritic 是一个用于工具增强型大语言模型对话的诊断框架，能够识别八种特定的工具调用错误并向主模型提供定向反馈，帮助其在多轮对话中改进工具使用。实验在 SGD 数据集上显示工具调用准确性提升最多约 13%，优于零-shot 提示和自我纠错等基线，表明在真实应用中提升外部工具集成的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工具调用在多轮对话中的可靠性问题。当前 LLM 在调用外部工具时可能出现提前调用、参数错位、对工具输出理解偏差等错误，影响系统整体性能。建立诊断与纠错机制以提升工具的正确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 界定并构建八种针对工具调用的错误类型，设计合成数据集来训练 ToolCritic。主模型假设具备较强推理、任务理解和编排能力，ToolCritic 对对话中的错误进行检测并给出定向反馈，主模型据此修正回答。通过在 Schema-Guided Dialogue（SGD）数据集上的实验验证 ToolCritic 在工具调用准确性上相较基线提升（最高约13%），并优于零-shot 提示和自我纠错等方法。

Result: ToolCritic 能在多轮、工具增强的对话场景中识别八类工具调用错误并提供针对性反馈，使主模型据此修正，从而实现对工具调用准确性的提升（在 SGD 上最高提升约13%）。合成数据集用于训练并评估该框架，实验结果支持其有效性。

Conclusion:  ToolCritic 为提升大语言模型与外部工具的鲁棒结合提供了一个可扩展的诊断+纠错框架。未来工作可拓展到更多数据集、更多类型的工具以及更丰富的反馈信号，以进一步提升实际应用中的工具调用鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估主观且难以标准化；鱼类新鲜度评估需客观、可解释且鲁棒的方法；通过公开数据集验证有效性。

Method: 从鱼眼全图及感兴趣区域（ROI）提取颜色统计、跨多色空间直方图以及纹理特征（LBP、GLCM），对特征进行逐步融合；在标准train-test设置下，使用LightGBM实现分类，获得77.56%准确率；数据增强后，使用ANN达到97.16%准确率。

Result: LightGBM 77.56%（相比基线63.21%提升14.35%），数据增强后 ANN 97.16%（超越前最佳77.3%约19.86%）。

Conclusion:  handcrafted 特征经恰当处理可提供鲁棒、可解释且适用于实际食品质量监测的自动鱼眼新鲜度评估方案。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理信息约束的LLM框架PILLM，通过在进化循环中生成、评估和 refin(e)异常检测规则，结合热力学与控制理论约束，达到高性能且可解释的HVAC异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVAC系统能耗高，需兼具解释性与物理一致性的异常检测方法；现有方法要么规则可解释却缺乏自适应，要么深度学习缺乏透明性和物理约束；LLMs虽有较好解释力，但常忽视物理原理。

Method: 在进化循环中自动生成、评估、改进异常检测规则；引入物理信息反射(reflection)与交叉算子(crossover)，将热力学和控制理论约束嵌入规则学习过程；在公开Building Fault Detection数据集上实证。

Result: 达到sota性能，同时产出可解释、可操作的诊断规则，提升可信赖性与可部署性。

Conclusion: 物理信息约束的LLM能够生成自适应且具有物理可行性的异常检测规则，有助于推动智能建筑领域的可部署AI。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

TL;DR: 提出 ProtocolBench 及 ProtocolRouter，通过基准测试比较多智能体系统中的通信协议对性能与鲁棒性的影响，并提供标准化评估工具 ProtocolRouterBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多智能体系统中，通信协议层显著影响任务成功、时延和容错等性能，但协议选择多依赖直觉，缺乏系统化评估与指导。

Method: 建立 ProtocolBench 框架，沿任务成功率、端到端时延、消息/字节开销和失败鲁棒性四个轴进行比较；在 Streaming Queue、Fail-Storm Recovery 等场景实验；提出可学习的 ProtocolRouter，根据需求和运行信号在不同场景/模块间选择协议；发布 ProtocolRouterBench。

Result: 不同协议在同一场景下对完成时间、端到端时延差异显著（最高差异分别达 36.5% 和 3.48 s）；在 Fail-Storm Recovery 场景中鲁棒性也存在差异；ProtocolRouter 比单一最优协议在恢复时间上最高提升 18.1%；在 GAIA 等场景实现特定提升。

Conclusion: 协议选择对系统行为影响显著，需标准化评估工具并通过可学习路由提升在不同场景的性能与鲁棒性，ProtocolRouterBench 的发布有助于提升大规模系统的可靠性。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评分性能有限，而端到端深度学习往往缺乏临床可解释性。需要一个既高效又可被临床信任的VT/VF风险预测框架。

Method: 使用大规模ECG基础模型ECGFounder提取150维诊断概率特征；对特征进行筛选后训练XGBoost分类器。数据集包含6,634例AMI患者ECG，其中175例发生院内VT/VF。评估指标为AUC和F1分数，并通过SHAP实现解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型ECGFounder + XGBoost的AUC为0.801，显著高于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和端到端1D-CNN(0.720)。SHAP显示如室早搏为风险因素、窦性心律为保护因素等特征，与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为VT/VF风险预测提供了一种新范式，利用基础模型输出进行自动特征工程，同时实现可解释的AI辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

*Melik Ozolcer,Sang Won Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过对一个Web部署、具备工具辅助功能的LLM健康教练进行评估，发现统一重工具策略在日志平均值上提升但对某些亚群有害；引入小型早期信息增益奖励的模拟器能缩短trait识别并提升目标达成与某些指标（pass@3）；建议以“评估优先”的个性化路径：冻结生成器，基于类型化奖励学习亚群感知的决策头，并对每个原型输出指标以揭示平均值掩盖的亚群伤害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际用户场景中，将工具集成到LLM健康教练中，以实现个性化和高效互动；同时关注评估方法，确保不同亚群不会被简单的平均指标掩盖的潜在伤害。

Method: 使用分解的决策头（Tool/Style）进行离线策略评估（OPE），比较统一的重工具策略对平均值和亚群效应的影响；构建带隐藏原型的轻量级仿真器，探索早期信息增益奖励对 trait 识别速度、目标达成和特定指标的影响；提出“评估优先”的个性化路径：冻结生成器、在打分_reward上学习亚群感知的决策头，并对每个原型输出指标以揭示潜在的亚群伤害。

Result: 结果显示：1) 重工具策略在日志的平均价值上提升，但对低健康素养/高自我效能等特定亚群造成伤害；2) 小型早期信息增益奖励能显著缩短 trait 识别时间，提升目标达成率和pass@3等指标。

Conclusion: 提出以评估为先的个性化路径：冻结生成器、基于类型化奖励学习面向亚群的决策头，并对每个原型输出指标以揭示平均值掩盖的亚群伤害，从而推动对个性化与公平性的更好权衡。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

TL;DR: TD-HNODE提出一种以时序详细超图为基础的神经ODE框架，用于建模疾病进展的连续时间动力学，在临床轨迹上表示疾病并发症的发展。相较于基线方法，能更好地捕捉不规则时间样本与患者异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要在不规则时间点的真实世界EHR数据中学习连续时间的进展模式，并处理患者在进展速率与路径上的异质性。现有方法要么缺乏对真实数据的适应性，要么难以捕捉复杂的连续时间动力学。

Method: 将疾病进展在临床认可的轨迹上表示为一个时序详细的超图，并通过神经微分方程（ODE）框架学习连续时间的进展动力学。TD-HNODE包含可学习的TD-超图Laplacian，用以捕捉同一进展轨迹内在部件及跨进展轨迹之间的依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实世界临床数据集上进行验证，TD-HNODE在糖尿病及相关心血管疾病进展建模任务中，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了疾病进展建模的能力，有助于患者亚分型与及时干预的潜在实现；并且展示了时序详细超图在医疗健康领域建模复杂动力学的有效性。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 混合框架 LaGAT：将从 MAGAT 学到的启发式整合到 LaCAM 的搜索框架中，在高密度 MAPF 场景下实现接近最优解的实时求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集多智能体路径规划（MAPF）中实现实时、接近最优的求解仍然困难。单独的搜索方法或纯学习方法在密集、耦合强的场景下往往表现不足，亟需一种高效的混合策略。

Method: 改进 MAGAT 架构，采用图注意力机制；在感兴趣的地图上进行“预训练-微调”；将学习到的启发式嵌入到领先的基于搜索的 LaCAM 算法中，同时设计死锁检测机制以应对潜在的神经引导不完美问题。

Result: LaGAT 在密集场景中优于纯搜索和纯学习的方法，显示了混合搜索在密集的多智能体协调问题上的强大潜力。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的混合搜索策略，可以在实时性和解的质量之间取得良好折衷，成为解决紧密耦合的 MAPF 问题的有效范式。

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

### [124] [Label Indeterminacy in AI & Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17463)
*Cor Steging,Tadeusz Zbiegień*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该摘要论述在法律领域应用的机器学习中存在标签不确定性（因干预措施如和解、上诉等导致最终结果不同），现有的标签填充方法基于不可验证的假设，训练时标签的构造方式会显著影响模型行为，因此应在AI法律研究中关注标签不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律结果往往受人类干预影响，单纯以过去结果作为地标会掩盖真实因果关系与潜在结果分布，从而导致偏差和不可靠的预测。

Method: 对标签不确定性进行理论论证，概述可用于推断不确定标签的方法，并在欧洲人权法院（ECHR）案例分类任务中实证检验，显示训练时标签构造如何显著影响模型行为。

Result: 证据表明标签的构造对模型行为有显著影响；现有用于填充不确定标签的方法都依赖不可验证的假设；应将标签不确定性作为AI与法律领域的一个关键关注点。

Conclusion: 将标签不确定性纳入AI与法律的研究框架，并在模型设计与评估中考虑干预因素，以提升法律ML应用的可靠性与公平性。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

TL;DR: 提出一种结构感知蒸馏方法，将VLLM的推理能力映射到更小模型，以提升代码生成的结构理解与跨基准表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成不仅要预测令牌，还需解决方案层级的结构关系和算法推理；VLLM具备推理能力，但成本高，需要更小更快的替代方案。

Method: 通过结构感知损失优化，学习识别正确的解题路径，并在问题定义与潜在解之间建立结构对应，将大模型的推理能力映射到小模型。

Result: 在 MBPP、MBPP Plus、HumanEval 基准上，微调模型在 pass@1、数据流均值、语法匹配均值等指标显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法使小模型具备更深的解题结构理解，超越简单的逐令牌生成，且训练过程简单、成本低，便于大规模部署。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

TL;DR: 构建 Prophet Arena 的评估基准，对“LLM 作为 先知”的预测能力进行系统评估，结果显示潜力显著但存在数据召回、信息整合等瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测对金融、经济等社会系统至关重要；基于大规模互联网数据训练的 LLM 可能具备未来事件预测能力，但需要在受控、规模化实验中系统评估其能力与局限性。

Method: 构建 Prophet Arena，持续收集实时预测任务并将每个任务拆解为可控的管线阶段，支持大规模实验；对多家 LLM 的预测能力进行评估，关注校准、预测置信度与潜在的市场收益，并分析误差来源与瓶颈。

Result: LLMs 表现出令人印象深刻的预测能力，校准误差小、预测置信度稳定、潜在的市场收益良好；但仍存在关键信息瓶颈：事件召回不准确、对数据源的理解不足、在分辨率接近时信息汇聚速度慢等。

Conclusion: LLM 在预测智能方面具有潜力，但要达到更高水平需改进事件召回、数据源理解与高效信息整合的能力；该基准为系统研究与推动该领域发展提供平台。

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM) 与 HyCAM 框架，用于在大模型中实现多任务自适应的高效性与知识保留，结合共享的 CAM 与专用轻量 CAM，以及动态路由，实现跨任务平均提升约 3.65%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型具备强泛化能力，但在多任务自适应方面存在挑战，常规微调易造成遗忘，参数高效方法在复杂多任务场景下效果不足。

Method: 提出 CAM，动态调控自注意力表示以增强任务特征并保留通用知识。将 CAM 与 HyCAM 结合：在 HyCAM 框架中使用一个共享的全参数 CAM 模块和若干专用的轻量 CAM 模块，辅以动态路由实现知识的自适应融合。

Result: 在包括问答、代码生成、逻辑推理等异构任务上的广泛实验显示，该方法显著优于现有方法，平均性能提升约 3.65%。

Conclusion: CAM+HyCAM 能在保持知识保留的同时提升任务特定化能力，实现高效、有效的多任务自适应，且实现细节与数据/代码公开以便复现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确失败根源：是没有感知到证据，还是没有有效利用证据；通过分析层级注意力来分离感知与推理的瓶颈，并提出可推广的诊断性干预。

Method: 系统分析VLM的层级注意力动态：浅层偏向文本、深层专注局部证据区；发现“看见但不相信”现象，即模型在给出错误答案时也能感知证据。提出推理时的注意力掩码干预，突出深层证据区域，属于无训练成本的推理时方法，适用于多家模型（LLaVA、Qwen、Gemma、InternVL）。

Result: 该干预在多家模型上带来准确性提升，表明VLM内部已编码可依赖的证据，但未被充分利用；显式暴露证据信号有助于缩小感知与推理之间的差距。

Conclusion: VLMs具备可信证据表征，但需要通过解释性干预来提升推理能力与可靠性，所提出的方法为诊断与提高鲁棒性提供了可行的无训练成本途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.

Motivation: 利用两类互补信号（语义相关性和词汇相关性）提升检索效果，同时尽量控制推理成本和延迟。

Method: 以MS-MARCO为基准的大规模训练，提取 dense 表示，与手工词汇特征融合；用基于决策树的学习排序模型进行融合学习；构建两阶段检索：第一阶段用密集检索器进行最近邻搜索，第二阶段用LTR重新排序候选集.

Result: 端到端排名在公开资源上的实验中显著提升，nDCG@10提升可达11%，平均查询延迟仅增加约4.3%。

Conclusion: 证实将两类信号无缝结合可提升检索效果，同时对效率影响相对较小，提出的混合信号框架具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We investigate the exploitation of both lexical and neural relevance signals
for ad-hoc passage retrieval. Our exploration involves a large-scale training
dataset in which dense neural representations of MS-MARCO queries and passages
are complemented and integrated with 253 hand-crafted lexical features
extracted from the same corpus. Blending of the relevance signals from the two
different groups of features is learned by a classical Learning-to-Rank (LTR)
model based on a forest of decision trees. To evaluate our solution, we employ
a pipelined architecture where a dense neural retriever serves as the first
stage and performs a nearest-neighbor search over the neural representations of
the documents. Our LTR model acts instead as the second stage that re-ranks the
set of candidates retrieved by the first stage to enhance effectiveness. The
results of reproducible experiments conducted with state-of-the-art dense
retrievers on publicly available resources show that the proposed solution
significantly enhances the end-to-end ranking performance while relatively
minimally impacting efficiency. Specifically, we achieve a boost in nDCG@10 of
up to 11% with an increase in average query latency of only 4.3%. This confirms
the advantage of seamlessly combining two distinct families of signals that
mutually contribute to retrieval effectiveness.

Abstract: Reviewer recommendation is a critical task for enhancing the efficiency of
academic publishing workflows. However, research in this area has been
persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are
often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of
different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a
large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025)
from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform
https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers
and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including
clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our
comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods
significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by
our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between
academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging
language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment
between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our
experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the
recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a
comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and
facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems. The

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: STAR-RAG: 一个时序图谱的GraphRAG框架，通过构建时间对齐的规则图并在其上进行传播来限制检索空间、聚焦时间一致且语义相关的证据，从而在不需要大量模型再训练的情况下实现更高的准确性与更低的代币消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时序知识图谱（Temporal KG）中，检索需要对时间保持一致且高效。现有的RAG方法多偏向语义层面，往往忽略显式的时间约束，导致答案随时间不一致且代币开销增大。

Method: 提出STAR-RAG的两大核心思路：1) 构建一个时间对齐的规则图，2) 在该图上进行传播以缩小检索空间、优先选择语义相关且时间一致的证据。通过强制时间接近性来进行检索，减少候选结果集、降低代币消耗，同时不牺牲准确度。相比现有的时序RAG方法，STAR-RAG无需大规模模型训练或微调，降低计算成本，简化部署。

Result: 在真实的时序KG数据集上进行的大量实验显示，与强基线GraphRAG相比，STAR-RAG在提高答案准确性同时实现更低的代币使用。其对比于现有时序RAG方法，亦省去了对模型的重量级训练需求，具备更低的计算成本与更简便的部署。

Conclusion: STAR-RAG通过时间对齐的规则图和图传播，有效地在检索阶段引入时间一致性约束，缩小候选集合并降低代币消耗，同时保持或提升准确性，展示了时序KG检索的新方向与应用潜力。

Abstract: Question answering in temporal knowledge graphs requires retrieval that is
both time-consistent and efficient. Existing RAG methods are largely semantic
and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to
time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a
temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a
time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the
search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence.
This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate
set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing
accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates
the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing
computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.Extensive
experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves
improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG
baselines.

Result: 在吞吐量、延迟、能耗方面优于强 CPU 竞争对手；吞吐量方面达到最佳 QPS，延迟方面达到最佳观测值，放大因子高达 16.6 倍；在能耗方面相比 CPU 基准可节省多达 11.9 倍。

Conclusion: FPGA 基于 kNN 搜索的方案为学习表示的高维数据提供了高能效与可扩展性，能够在吞吐量与延迟之间进行权衡，具备在实际大规模部署中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the usage of FPGA devices for energy-efficient exact
kNN search in high-dimension latent spaces. This work intercepts a relevant
trend that tries to support the increasing popularity of learned
representations based on neural encoder models by making their large-scale
adoption greener and more inclusive. The paper proposes two different
energy-efficient solutions adopting the same FPGA low-level configuration. The
first solution maximizes system throughput by processing the queries of a batch
in parallel over a streamed dataset not fitting into the FPGA memory. The
second minimizes latency by processing each kNN incoming query in parallel over
an in-memory dataset. Reproducible experiments on publicly available image and
text datasets show that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based
competitors regarding throughput, latency, and energy consumption.
Specifically, experiments show that the proposed FPGA solutions achieve the
best throughput in terms of queries per second and the best-observed latency
with scale-up factors of up to 16.6X. Similar considerations can be made
regarding energy efficiency, where results show that our solutions can achieve
up to 11.9X energy saving w.r.t. strong CPU-based competitors.

*Xiaokai Wei,Jiajun Wu,Daiyao Yi,Reza Shirkavand,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 对生成式推荐中的 token 布局进行系统研究，比较互嵌（interleaved）与非互嵌布局，提出非互嵌的 Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC) 方法，在保持信息最大化、条件关系、无信息泄露等原则的同时，显著降低计算成本并实现与互嵌方法相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在 GR 场景中，物品与行为（如观看时长、购买、评论）以令牌形式输入输出，布局将直接影响模型能利用的信息与泛化能力；需要一个以原则为支撑的设计来同时最大化信号、保持“给定物品的行为”条件关系、并避免信息泄露。互嵌布局直观符合这三条原则但会导致序列长度膨胀、训练/推理成本高，因此需要高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于三个设计原则（P1-P3）开展统一分析，比较互嵌与非互嵌布局；提出 Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC) 作为非互嵌的有效方案；在公开数据集与大规模生产日志上进行广泛实验，评估不同布局的效果与计算成本，验证原则的可行性与实用性。

Result: 互嵌布局天然满足 P1-P3，但因序列长度膨胀导致训练/推理成本上升；提出的非互嵌方法 LAC 在保持或提升准确率的同时，显著降低 FLOPs；实证结果支持在准确性和效率之间取得良好折中，并为 GR 系统提供可操作的布局设计建议。

Conclusion: 对 GR 的 token 布局提供了一套以原理为驱动的设计指南，非互嵌的 LAC 在多数据场景中与互嵌方案相比具有竞争力甚至更优的性能，同时显著降低计算成本，推动高效、精确的生成式推荐系统落地。

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) models treat a user's interaction history as a
sequence to be autoregressively predicted. When both items and actions (e.g.,
watch time, purchase, comment) are modeled, the layout-the ordering and
visibility of item/action tokens-critically determines what information the
model can use and how it generalizes. We present a unified study of token
layouts for GR grounded in first principles: (P1) maximize item/action signal
in both input/output space, (P2) preserve the conditioning relationship "action
given item" and (P3) no information leakage.
  While interleaved layout (where item and action occupy separate tokens)
naturally satisfies these principles, it also bloats sequence length with
larger training/inference cost. On the non-interleaved front, we design a novel
and effective approach, Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC), which appears strange
on the surface but aligns well with the design principles to yield strong
accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale
production logs evaluate different layout options and empirically verifies the
design principles. Our proposed non-interleaved method, LAC, achieves
competitive or superior quality at substantially lower FLOPs than interleaving.
Our findings offer actionable guidance for assembling GR systems that are both
accurate and efficient.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种基于文本表征的上下文感知推理增强生成式检索框架，结合自进化的后训练（监督微调+强化学习）与去偏的 GRPO，在真实电商日志上显著提升排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在电商搜索中的时空、历史行为及当前查询信息构成隐性偏好，现有方法难以有效整合这些上下文以准确理解用户意图。

Method: 将异质上下文统一成文本表示或文本语义标识并对齐；引入自进化的后训练范式，迭代地结合监督微调与强化学习提升推理能力；提出去偏的 GRPO 变体以改进排序；在真实搜索日志上评估。

Result: 与强基线相比，所提方法在搜索-基于推荐任务中表现更优，验证了对复杂上下文的理解与推理能力的提升效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过文本化上下文表征和自进化推理训练，显著提升搜索推荐的用户意图理解与排序性能，具备良好应用前景。

Abstract: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios
in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal
factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute
an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences
that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and
their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge.
Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search
methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual
information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced
generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated
context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item
contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and
aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we
introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the
model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in
existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased
variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search
log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出并研究数据集检索的新任务DSE（带示例的 Dataset Search），并扩展至可解释的DSE，构建DSEBench并提供字段级标注与大量LLM生成的注释，用于训练与评估。并在多种稀疏/密集/LLM检索、再排序与解释方法上设立基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索仅基于关键字相关性或相似性，难以同时表达多重信息需求。需要一个可解释的、字段级别的评估基准来支持带示例的Dataset Search及解释性推理，弥补缺乏公开基准的问题。

Method: 构建DSEBench，提供数据集级和字段级注释；使用大语言模型生成大量注释用于训练；在稀疏向量、密集向量和LLM基础的方法上，进行检索、再排序和解释性方法的改编与基线评估。

Result: 提出并公开DSEBench及其标注集合，给出多种基线的评估，提供对Explainable DSE的可行性与若干经验洞见，但无具体定量结果在摘要中披露。

Conclusion: DSEBench可作为Explainable DSE的标准测试集，结合LLM生成的注释能提升训练数据覆盖，未来可进一步改进模型与评估框架。

Abstract: Dataset search has been an established information retrieval task. Current
paradigms either retrieve datasets that are relevant to a keyword query or find
datasets that are similar to an input target dataset. To allow for their
combined specification of information needs, in this article, we investigate
the more generalized task of Dataset Search with Examples (DSE) and further
extend it to Explainable DSE that requires identifying the metadata and content
fields of a dataset that indicate its relevance to the query and similarity to
the target datasets. To facilitate this research, we construct DSEBench, a test
collection that provides high-quality dataset- and field-level annotations to
enable the evaluation of explainable DSE. We also employ a large language model
to generate numerous annotations to be used for training. We establish
extensive baselines on DSEBench by adapting and evaluating a variety of sparse,
dense, and LLM-based retrieval, reranking, and explanation methods.

*Wenyu Mao,Jiancan Wu,Guoqing Hu,Wei Ji,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TA-Rec 提出一个两阶段框架，通过在预训练阶段对去噪函数进行 Temporal Consistency Regularization 实现一次性生成，并在微调阶段使用 Adaptive Preference Alignment 以对齐用户偏好，从而缓解扩散模型在序列推荐中的离散化误差与效率-效果折中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  diffusion 模型在序列推荐中需要多步去噪，离散化近似引入误差，造成计算成本和推荐效果之间的权衡；需要在保持效果的同时提高推理效率。

Method: 两阶段：1) 预训练阶段引入 Temporal Consistency Regularization（TCR），使相邻步骤的去噪结果保持一致，从而实现将噪声映射为一组可选择项的一步生成；2) 微调阶段引入 Adaptive Preference Alignment（APA），基于偏好对相似度与时间步信息自适应对齐去噪过程与用户偏好。

Result: 大量实验表明，TA-Rec 的两阶段目标有效缓解因离散化造成的折中，提升 diffusion-based 推荐器的效率与效果。

Conclusion: TA-Rec 提供了一种有效的两阶段学习策略，既降低离散化误差，又提升了推荐系统的整体性能，为扩散模型在序列推荐中的应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative
sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend
guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process.
However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing
discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency
and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec,
a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the
denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by
aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the
efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains
the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing
the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we
can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step
with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces
Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user
preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps.
Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively
mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both
efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.

### [137] [How role-play shapes relevance judgment in zero-shot LLM rankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17535)
*Yumeng Wang,Jirui Qi,Catherine Chen,Panagiotis Eustratiadis,Suzan Verberne*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Role-play prompts significantly steer zero-shot LLM ranking; analysis shows early-layer encoding of role signals, with mid-layer interaction to task instructions and limited interaction with queries/docs; a set of attention heads encodes critical role-conditioned relevance, informing prompt design for IR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how role-play prompts shape LLM-based ranking, improving robustness, interpretability, and guidance for prompt design in information retrieval (IR).

Method: Apply causal intervention from mechanistic interpretability to trace how role-play information propagates through LLMs, identify layer-wise dynamics and attention heads responsible for role-conditioned relevance, and assess interaction with prompts, queries, and documents.

Result: Formulations of role descriptions substantially affect ranking quality. Role-play signals are predominantly encoded in early layers and interact with task instructions in middle layers, with limited interaction with representations of queries or documents. A specific group of attention heads encodes information critical for role-conditioned relevance.

Conclusion: These findings illuminate the mechanisms by which role-play influences LLM ranking and provide practical guidance for designing more effective prompts in IR, while suggesting broader opportunities to leverage role-play in zero-shot applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but
their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular,
role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity,
often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms
and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both
effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how
role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal
intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how
role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the
ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in
early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while
receiving limited interaction with query or document representations.
Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information
critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on
the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for
designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader
opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lean Finder 是一个面向 Lean 与 mathlib 的语义检索引擎，目标在理解并对齐数学家的检索意图方面超越现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化定理证明的进展受限于定位相关定理的困难以及 Lean 4 的学习曲线，现有检索工具多依赖非正式化文本且与实际查询错配。

Method: 通过分析并聚类公开 Lean 讨论的语义、对合成查询进行文本嵌入微调、结合多样反馈信号对模型进行对齐，并在多角度目标导向上编码用户目标；并使 Lean Finder 能与基于大模型的定理证明器兼容。

Result: 在真实查询、非正式化语句和证明状态的评估中，相较于先前的检索引擎和 GPT-4o，Lean Finder 实现了超过 30% 的相对改进；并实现与 LLM 证明器的无缝衔接。

Conclusion: Lean Finder 为检索与形式推理之间建立桥梁，提升数学家的检索效率和证明工作流的协同性，同时为未来与更强大证明系统的集成奠定基础。

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

### [139] [Lyapunov-Stable Adaptive Control for Multimodal Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15944)
*Tianyu Bell Pan,Mengdi Zhu,Alexa Jordyn Cole,Ronald Wilson,Damon L. Woodard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LS-OGD is an online adaptive framework for multimodal learning under concept drift that dynamically adjusts learning rates and fusion weights based on drift and prediction errors, with guarantees of bounded error and convergence to zero when drift stops, and with an adaptive fusion mechanism that mitigates modality-specific drift for robust, continuous adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal learning, non-stationary environments induce concept drift that degrades performance. Modality-specific drifts and lack of continuous adaptation mechanisms hinder reliability. A principled, adaptive controller is needed to maintain performance over time.

Method: Introduce LS-OGD, an online controller that (i) dynamically tunes the model's learning rate and (ii) adapts fusion weights across modalities in response to detected drift and evolving errors. Provide theoretical analysis under bounded drift showing uniformly ultimately bounded error and convergence to zero if drift ceases. Implement an adaptive fusion strategy to isolate severe modality-specific drift, enhancing resilience.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: prediction error is uniformly ultimately bounded; if drift ceases, error converges to zero. The adaptive fusion effectively isolates modality-specific drift, improving fault tolerance and system resilience.

Conclusion: LS-OGD provides a principled foundation for reliable, continuously adapting multimodal learning in non-stationary environments by integrating online control of learning and fusion with drift-aware guarantees.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

*Guangya Wan,Zixin Stephen Xu,Sasa Zorc,Manel Baucells,Mengxuan Hu,Hao Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEACON 是一个贝叶斯自适应停止框架，用于在多次采样 LLM 输出时决定何时停止，以在信息增益与计算成本之间取得折中；具理论最优性与实证可行性，能在保持质量的同时将采样量显著降低（高达 80%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多次采样可以提升输出质量，但带来显著的计算成本；需要一个 principled 的停止准则来在收益和成本之间做权衡。

Method: 基于序贯搜索与贝叶斯学习，BEACON 逐步从策略 LLM 生成回复，实时更新对奖励分布的后验信念（无需额外训练），并通过比较未来潜在收益的边际效用与计算成本来决定是否继续采样；当进一步探索的边际收益小于成本时停止。

Result: 给出理论最优性保证与实际可行性分析；实证结果显示平均采样量可减少最多约80%，同时保持输出质量；展示了在成本有效的偏好数据生成中的应用潜力，并给出未来工作的扩展方向。

Conclusion: BEACON 提供一个面向成本效益的自适应采样框架，适用于多任务的 LLM 输出评估与偏好数据收集，具有良好的扩展性与实用性，未来可结合更广泛的奖励结构与任务场景进行扩展。

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态检测方法对隐含讽刺、隐喻等隐性表达缺乏鲁棒性，容易产生漏检或错解，因此需要建模潜在误判风险并引导模型推理。

Method: 构建知识库，将每个表情包分解为误判风险模式及其原因；对目标表情包检索相关模式，并动态引导大语言模型/多模态模型的推理以规避已知误判点。

Result: 在包含6,626个表情包、5项有害检测任务的基准上，PatMD在F1-score平均提升8.30%，准确率提升7.71%，显示较强的泛化与检测能力。

Conclusion: 以可解释的风险模式驱动的动态推理引导策略有效提升隐含有害内容检测能力，具有良好通用性和潜在扩展性。

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着脑电记录的体量和复杂性增加，依赖专家进行可视化评审的方法变得不可行，需要自动化的 EEG 信号分类以提高效率和一致性。

Method: 将 WaveNet 架构改造用于 EEG 数据，进行端到端的分类；使用公开的带标注的数据集，通过 70/20/10 的划分进行训练、验证和测试；对比基线包括 CNN、LSTM 和 TCN；包括动态数据集分区、归一化等预处理步骤以提升泛化能力。

Result: 模型实现了超越先前 CNN 与 LSTM 的分类准确率，并在与 TCN 的基线对比中表现具有竞争力；对噪声与伪影的识别具有高精度；生理与病理之间存在可解释的轻度混淆，体现临床信号重叠的固有特征。

Conclusion: WaveNet 架构（扩张因果卷积与残差连接）适合 EEG 数据，因为它能同时捕捉局部细节与长程时间依赖；结合合适的预处理流程，可提升模型的泛化能力并更好地区分噪声/伪影与生理、病理信号。

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire

proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出 Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL)，通过双蒸馏策略在 factual 与 counterfactual 测试环境中均衡提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏差去偏通常在 counterfactual 测试中表现良好，但在实际 factual 测试中性能受损；需要一个在两种测试环境上均表现良好的统一框架。

Method: 引入 BPL 框架，采用两种蒸馏策略：1) 从带偏见的教师模型进行教师-学生蒸馏以保留与收集反馈对齐的偏好知识，提升 factual 测试；2) 通过带可靠性筛选的自蒸馏在训练过程中迭代细化知识，提升对更多用户-商品组合的预测能力，从而提升 counterfactual 测试。

Result: 在 factual 与 counterfactual 两类测试上均展现出显著效果，实验验证有效性，代码公开。

Conclusion: BPL 提供一个统一的偏差自适应学习框架，逐步揭示用户偏好，提升对多样化用户-物品组合的预测能力，在两种测试环境中表现良好。

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过对 DS/SCG及其混合物的热解研究，结合 AI 提升热解建模与优化，评估氢产潜力；KAS 被认为是最准确的等温化方法，LSTM 对 TGA 曲线预测具极高相关性，混合物在氢产量与活化能方面存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进可持续能源与废弃物管理，将未充分利用的生物质（如 DS 与 SCG）转化为氢气，提升过程建模与优化的精度与效率，探索混合物的潜力。

Method: 对纯 DS、纯 SCG 及混合物（75/25、50/50、25/75）进行 proximate/ultimate/fiber，TGA/DTG，动力学、热力学和 Py-Micro GC 分析；基于等温化（KAS、FWO、Friedman）的方法进行动力学建模；训练基于木质纤维素数据的 LSTM 模型以预测 TGA 曲线。

Result: Blend 3 氢产潜力最高，但 Ea 最大（313.24 kJ/mol）；Blend 1 Ea 最低（161.75 kJ/mol）；KAS 被判定为最准确的等温化方法；LSTM 模型在 TGA 曲线预测中实现 R^2 约 0.9996–0.9998。

Conclusion: 将 AI 集成到热解建模与优化中可显著提升精度与效率；DS/SCG 的混合使用有潜力优化氢产率；需要进一步的工艺参数优化与放大研究。

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

*Yiyang Li,Zehong Wang,Zhengqing Yuan,Zheyuan Zhang,Keerthiram Murugesan,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个名为 LAMI 的联合图-语言建模框架，用于检测青少年青年人群的非法药物使用并解释相关行为风险因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在大规模调查（如 YRBS、NSDUH）中建模时，往往把调查变量独立对待，忽略变量之间的潜在耦合结构和潜在关系，对风险路径的可解释性不足。需要同时捕捉变量之间的潜在关系与语义信息，以提升预测与解释能力。

Method: LAMI 将个体回答表示为关系图，使用专门的图结构学习层挖掘潜在连接，并整合大语言模型以生成建立在图结构与调查语义基础之上的自然语言解释。

Result: 在 YRBS 与 NSDUH 数据集上的实验表明，LAMI 在预测准确性方面优于竞争基线。可解释性分析显示其揭示了有意义的行为子结构和心理社会路径，例如家庭动态、同伴影响和校园相关困扰等，与既有的药物使用风险因素相吻合。

Conclusion: LAMI 能提供对青少年及青少年群体药物使用风险的潜在机制洞察，提升检测准确性与解释性，并揭示与家庭、同伴、学校等因素相关的风险通路。

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

TL;DR: 提出一种分辨率感知的检索增强预测模型，用于无历史条件的零-shot微气候预测，通过对信号分解为低/高频实现全局与局部的检索，在ERA5数据上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏历史数据或新地点条件下进行准确预测是一大挑战，需同时利用空间相关性和不同频率信息来实现数据高效且可扩展的零-shot预测。

Method: 提出 Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting（RARA）模型，对信号进行分解成低频与高频分量，低频组件使用更广域的空间上下文，高频组件聚焦局部影响，并采用分辨率感知的检索机制动态获取相关历史数据以适应新地点。

Result: 在 ERA5 数据集上的微气候预测任务中，RARA 相较传统方法、数值天气预测模型以及主流时间序列模型，MSE 下降71%（优于 HRRR）和34%（优于 Chronos）。

Conclusion: 检索增强与分辨率感知策略对于零-shot 微气候建模和更广泛的场景具有潜在的可扩展性和数据效率优势。

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

*Tuowei Wang,Kun Li,Zixu Hao,Donglin Bai,Ju Ren,Yaoxue Zhang,Ting Cao,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Shadowy Sparsity 并基于其设计 Long Exposure 以加速大语言模型的参数高效微调（PEFT），通过三大组件实现对稀疏性、长序列与动态稀疏计算的高效处理，达到端到端微调的最高 2.49x 加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前 PEFT 的效率瓶颈导致时间成本高昂，需更高效的稀疏表示与硬件友好实现来提升微调速度与资源利用率。

Method: 提出 Shadowy Sparsity 的新稀疏形式；设计 Long Exposure 系统：Shadowy-sparsity Exposer（更长感知范围捕捉稀疏细节）、Sequence-oriented Predictor（高效预测以应对长序列和不断变化的参数）、Dynamic-aware Operator（促进更结构化计算与合并内存访问的动态稀疏计算）。

Result: 在端到端微调任务上，Long Exposure 相对于现有方法实现最高 2.49x 的加速；广泛评估显示优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Long Exposure 为 PEFT 在 LLMs 上的加速提供实证支持，展现了有效的系统级再设计以提升微调效率的潜力。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出面向LLMs记忆与持续学习的用户反馈仿真框架和跨领域、跨语言的综合基准，以评估在服务时学习能力；实验表明现有最先进基线在效率和效果上仍有较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据、参数和推理成本的持续扩增，效用边界趋于饱和；转向从实践中学习、建立记忆和持续学习框架成为提升LLM系统的重要方向。然而，现有记忆基准多聚焦于长输入的同质阅读理解，无法有效评估从用户反馈中持续学习的能力，需要更贴近应用场景的评估体系。

Method: 提出一个用户反馈仿真框架以及覆盖多领域、多语言、多任务类型的综合基准，用于评测LLM系统的 continual learning 能力；通过实验验证基线在该任务上的表现与效率均未达到理想水平。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有最先进模型在该基准上的有效性与效率均显著不足，存在明显改进空间。

Conclusion: 该基准有望推动后续在LLM记忆、持续学习与优化算法方面的研究，促使更贴近实际应用的评估与改进。

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

*Mohan Zhang,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Zhangyang Wang,Sijia Liu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种 Deadlock Attack 的对抗性嵌入攻击，通过训练恶意对比嵌入来诱导大语言模型的推理循环，利用触发词实现后门激活，能够在多种先进的 LRMs 上实现 100% 攻击成功率并强制生成到达最大 token 限制；具有隐蔽性与对现有缓解策略的鲁棒性，但引发对推理过程安全的新风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs 的链式推理（CoT）在多步推理中表现出色，但也暴露出新的攻击面——通过精心设计的嵌入诱导模型进入无限或长时间的推理循环，从而耗尽计算资源并降低可用性。研究旨在揭示这一推理过程相关的安全漏洞以及其对系统鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 通过训练一个恶意对抗嵌入来促使中间输出在推理步骤后出现过渡性标记（如 Wait、But），并解决连续到离散投影的空洞（projection gap）问题，采用后门植入策略确保在特定触发词下可靠激活。对 Phi-RM、Nemotron-Nano、R1-Qwen、R1-Llama 等模型和三个数学推理基准进行评估，度量攻击成功率、生成 token 的数量上限等。

Result: 在四种先进的LRMs与三个数学推理基准上实现 100% 的攻击成功率，迫使模型生成达到最大 token 限制；攻击对普通输入的影响极小，具备隐蔽性，并对现有试图缓解推动过度推理的策略表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 揭示了在推理过程中的重要安全漏洞，提示在部署大模型时需关注推理过程的可控性与资源消耗攻击的风险；需要开发更有效的检测、过滤与鲁棒性训练等防御措施来降低此类后门攻击对系统的威胁。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gains是一种开放集联邦学习的细粒度知识发现与适应方法，通过将编码器与分类器分离来区分域偏移与类别增量，提供贡献驱动的聚合与抗遗忘机制，在多域数据集的三种数据漂移场景下优于 baselines。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，客户端持续加入产生新知识，现有方法多为粗粒度知识发现，且在源域表现或适应效率上存在权衡。因此需要细粒度的知识发现与高效整合，并保护源域性能。

Method: Gains将模型分为编码器和分类器；编码器对域转换敏感，分类器对类别增量敏感；提出细粒度的知识发现、贡献驱动聚合和抗遗忘机制，确保对新知识的发现与融合，同时保持源域性能。

Result: 在多域数据集、三种数据漂移情景下，Gains显著优于其他基线，在源域和目标域客户端的性能上均有提升。

Conclusion: Gains提供一种有效的细粒度开放集联邦学习框架，兼顾适应性和源域性能，且公开代码。

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ICs中的高功率密度使热管理日益困难；基于PDE的方法虽准确但计算慢，难以用于迭代设计。现有ML方法如FNO在速度上有优势，但在高频信息保留和高保真数据依赖方面存在不足。

Method: 提出SAU-FNO框架，将自注意力机制与U-Net结构结合到傅里叶神经算子之上，以捕获远距离相关性并有效建模局部高频特征。通过迁移学习对低保真数据进行微调，降低对高保真数据的需求并加速训练。

Result: 实验表明SAU-FNO在热预测精度上达到/超过最新水平，并实现相对于传统有限元方法843x的加速（文中给出842x，近似）。

Conclusion: SAU-FNO为3D IC热仿真提供一种高效且高精度的解决方案，降低数据依赖并提升设计迭代速度，具备在工程应用中的潜在广泛使用前景。

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放词汇检测在遥感领域的歧义和细粒度类别带来的精度问题，以及需要快速、低成本的用户定制适配，而不依赖大规模全模型微调。

Method: 级联框架：先用零-shot模型生成高召回的目标提案；再用一个轻量级的、在极少用户标注样本上实时训练的分类器来提升精度。核心是FLAME主动学习：在边界附近用密度估计识别不确定的候选样本，再通过聚类确保多样性，从而高效采样。无需对主模型进行大规模微调，适配时间极短（<1分钟）。

Result: 在遥感基准上持续优于SOTA，展现出更高的准确性和更低的成本/时间成本，证明将基础模型快速定制到用户需求的实用性。

Conclusion: 证明通过把广泛泛化的基础模型与实时少样本分类相结合，并通过高效的主动学习策略，可以在遥感领域实现高效、可扩展的开放词汇目标检测定制。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Motivation: 目前对数据几何结构对模型性能的影响尚未被充分研究。希望通过拓扑特征来量化数据多样性与冗余度，从而为数据选取和清洗提供 principled 指导。

Method: 对数据在度量空间中应用持久同调，提取拓扑特征（如持久性图/条带、Betti 曲线、持久性谱等），通过不同过滤过程（如 Vietoris–Rips/Čech）得到对多样性和冗余的量化描述，与基于熵的多样性度量进行对比，探索在数据套件中的应用。

Result: 提出的拓扑特征被视为分析和提升训练数据的强大工具，能够在量化多样性和冗余方面提供超越传统熵等方法的洞见，指向通过拓扑驱动的数据选择和数据集改进策略。

Conclusion: 将持久同调等拓扑数据分析方法应用于训练数据分析与清洗，能作为补充性且更 principled 的工具来衡量数据的多样性与冗余，促进更高效和鲁棒的 AI 系统训练。

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

TL;DR: PALE 提出一种通过提示引导的自数据增强框架，用以提升对语言模型幻觉的检测能力，同时提出 CM Score 以对 LLM 激活空间中的真伪数据分布进行对比分析，提升检测效果且无需额外人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前幻觉检测面临缺乏带标注的真伪文本数据的问题。现有方法多依赖人工标注或昂贵的数据采集，且对中间嵌入的真假评估缺乏稳健性。

Method: PALE 框架通过使用提示引导的 LLM 回复来生成包含真伪标签的增强数据，从而实现低成本的数据扩增；引入对比马氏分数（CM Score）来评估激活空间中真伪数据的分布，通过矩阵分解更好地捕捉分布结构，且不需要额外的人类标注。

Result: 在实验中，PALE 显著提升幻觉检测性能，相较于强基线提升约 6.55%（具体指标未指明）。

Conclusion: PALE 提供了一种具有良好普适性和实用性的数据扩增和评估框架，可用于现实场景下的幻觉检测，且成本低、泛化能力强。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the

Conclusion: DAWP为在观测空间直接进行AI天气预测提供了一个有潜力的框架，AIDA初始化提升了性能与效率，并对全球降水预测具有应用前景。

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

*Zexu Sun,Yongcheng Zeng,Erxue Min,Heyang Gao,Bokai Ji,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cog-Rethinker is a hierarchical metacognitive RL framework that improves zero-shot RL for LLM reasoning by decomposing problems into subproblems and refining wrong answers, with supervised fine-tuning to align prompts; it achieves better sample efficiency and faster convergence on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address severe sampling inefficiencies in zero-RL RL training where fixed prompts yield many invalid outputs, wasting samples and hindering learning in weak LLMs.

Method: Introduce Cog-Rethinker: a two-stage hierarchical metacognitive rollout. Stage 1 prompts the policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to obtain final reasoning; Stage 2 uses the previously wrong solutions to refine answers by referencing earlier errors. Additionally, perform supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples from both stages with direct rollout templates to ensure train-test consistency.

Result: Empirical results show Cog-Rethinker achieves superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and demonstrates improved sample efficiency with faster convergence compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical metacognitive RL with explicit problem decomposition and error-based refinement, coupled with supervised fine-tuning, can significantly enhance zero-RL reasoning in LLMs by improving sample efficiency and convergence on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

### [159] [AMiD: Knowledge Distillation for LLMs with $α$-mixture Assistant Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15982)
*Donghyeok Shin,Yeongmin Kim,Suhyeon Jo,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMiD introduces alpha-mixture assistant distribution, a continuous, generalized family for knowledge distillation (KD) with LLMs, enabling a broader space of assistant distributions and divergences, leading to improved performance and training stability over fixed-distribution approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KD for autoregressive LLMs faces capacity gaps and training instability due to near-zero probabilities in high-dimensional output spaces. Prior works fixed a single assistant distribution and limited divergence choices. A systematic exploration of the interpolation path and divergence is needed to stabilize training and improve transfer from teacher to student.

Method: Define alpha-mixture assistant distribution as a generalized family parameterized by alpha, enabling a continuum of assistant distributions. Develop alpha-mixture distillation (AMiD), a unified KD framework that uses this distribution and a generalized set of divergences based on optimality considerations. Provide theoretical grounding and empirical validation across tasks.

Result: Experimentally, AMiD achieves superior performance and training stability compared to baselines, leveraging the broader assistant distribution space and the generalized divergences.

Conclusion: AMiD offers a theoretically grounded, unified KD framework for LLMs by introducing a continuous alpha parameter in the assistant distribution and extending the divergence family, addressing capacity gaps and training instability while improving distillation performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction

Conclusion: 推理在LLM中可能由激活空间中的组合性算法原语几何支撑，原语具备跨任务与跨模型的可迁移性，且通过推理相关微调可增强跨领域的算法泛化与可组合性。

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

### [163] [Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15990)
*Kangqi Ni,Zhen Tan,Zijie Liu,Pingzhi Li,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO is a conservative reweighting method for LLM reasoning; its improvements are bounded by the base model's distribution, leading to inconsistent gains across domains and no true novel generalization. OOD gains occur only when tasks align with pretrained biases; ID gains saturate. Thus GRPO sharpens pretraining biases rather than universally expanding reasoning, highlighting the need for algorithms that go beyond pretraining biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when GRPO improves reasoning and generalization, given observed inconsistencies across domains and OOD settings.

Method: Provide a theoretical analysis showing GRPO as a conservative reweighting scheme bounded by the base distribution; support it with controlled experiments by training transformers from scratch and testing generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality.

Result: Theoretical bound shows GRPO cannot discover completely novel solutions beyond the base distribution. Empirical results show OOD gains only when target tasks align with pretrained biases; ID gains decrease as performance saturates. Overall GRPO acts as a bias-sharpening tool rather than a universal reasoning enhancer.

Conclusion: GRPO does not universally enhance reasoning or generalization. Its benefits are constrained by pretrained biases, and to achieve true generalization beyond pretraining, new algorithms are needed that expand beyond the model's origin.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANaGRAM: a natural-gradient-inspired optimizer for PINNs using SVD with cutoff regularization, plus a multi-cutoff strategy. Demonstrates strong empirical gains on benchmark PDEs, achieving machine precision in some cases, with a spectral-theory framework providing justification for regularization and links to Green's functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural gradient methods have shown promise in improving PINN training by better conditioning and leveraging parameter-space geometry. However, understanding their training dynamics and the role of regularization remains important. The paper aims to provide theoretical grounding for why regularization is needed and how spectral theory and Green's functions relate to PINN optimization.

Method: Introduce ANaGRAM, an optimizer inspired by natural gradients that uses singular value decomposition with a cutoff regularization. Develop a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy to further enhance performance. Build a spectral-theory framework to explain regularization needs and connect with Green's functions theory.

Result: Empirical validation on benchmark PDEs shows that the proposed method improves training and, in some experiments, reaches machine precision.

Conclusion: A spectral-theory based justification clarifies why regularization is necessary in this context and extends the connections between PINN optimization and Green's function theory. The multi-cutoff ANaGRAM strategy provides practical performance gains on challenging PDE benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs). In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of PINNs optimized
with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

TL;DR: STAR 提出一个可插拔的状态感知模块，增强时间序列基础模型在多变量异常检测中的状态变量建模与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实工业场景中，时间序列不仅包含数值变量，还有大量离散状态变量（如阀门开关、星期几等），如果把状态变量同数值变量等同对待，会丢失其类别语义并削弱检测性能，需在微调阶段更好地建模和利用状态信息。

Conclusion: STAR 为时间序列基础模型提供了一个有效的状态感知微调模块，能够更充分利用状态变量信息，从而提升异常检测性能，具有良好的实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Conclusion: PNNs 展现出用于鲁棒、可扩展、计算高效的流场控制迁移学习框架的潜力，有望扩展到更复杂的流动配置；强调需要开发更高效的迁移学习框架以应用于真实复杂流场

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

Result: 在两个代码基准 OriGen 和 Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1 上的实验显示，IB-FT 显著缓解了记忆屏障，提升了 top-1 Pass@$1) 的性能，并在更严格的多样本评测 Pass@$k^(m)（当且仅当至少有 m 个样本通过单元测试才视为通过）下展现出更稳定的增益，相较于常规 FT。

Conclusion: IB-FT 能有效缓解记忆屏障，使模型在代码任务上的泛化能力和鲁棒性得到提升，相较于标准微调具有更稳定且显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Conclusion: 聚合物科学将因此得到一个统一、以构象为中心的基础模型，促进建模与设计的协同与普适化。

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了 AMS-Quant 的非整数位宽浮点量化，用 Mantissa-bit Sharing 与 Adaptive Searching 实现，针对大语言模型推理在存储与数据移动方面的瓶颈，显著提升解码速度且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型推理中的存储与带宽瓶颈，通过将量化从整数位宽扩展到非整数位宽的浮点量化，进一步压缩模型同时保持精度。

Result: 在大规模数据集和模型上，AMS-Quant 将模型量化到 FP-5.33-e2m3 与 FP4.25-e2m2，解码相对于 FP16 推理显著加速（2.8x 与 3.2x），且精度损失可以忽略。

Conclusion: 将量化扩展到非整数位宽的浮点量化成为可能，AMS-Quant 通过新的共享位和离线优化实现更高的压缩与速度，并具备实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

*Chenyang Yu,Xinpeng Xie,Yan Huang,Chenxi Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-based traffic forecasting models (STGCN, GraphWaveNet, STWave, D2STGNN) capture spatial-temporal dependencies; researchers incorporate event information, but early approaches rely on manual feature engineering, which limits generalization to unknown events and may lose semantic richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and responsive traffic forecasting is critical for ITS, especially amid rapid urbanization and rising congestion; models must capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and event-driven variability.

Method: Survey of foundational and newer GNN-based traffic forecasting models; examination of how event information is incorporated—from manually engineered features to subgraph constructions—highlighting strengths and limitations.

Result: Foundational and recent GNN models achieve strong performance on standard traffic datasets; incorporating event information can improve responsiveness but often depends on domain knowledge and low-dimensional features, risking loss of semantic richness.

Conclusion: To achieve robust generalization, develop event-aware models that reduce reliance on manual features and preserve rich semantic information, enabling effective handling of diverse and unknown events.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时序基础模型在预测准确性上表现突出，但其校准属性仍不充分研究。校准对实际应用（如风险评估和决策制定）至关重要，因此需要系统评估时序基础模型的校准特性。

Method: 对五种近期时序领域的基础模型及两种竞争性基线进行系统评估，评估内容包括模型校准（过度/不足自信）、不同预测头的影响，以及长期自回归预测下的校准表现。可能使用可靠性曲线、期望校准误差等评估指标。

Result: 时序基础模型的校准性显著优于基线模型，且总体上不呈现显著的过度自信或不足自信的趋势，与在其他深度学习模型中常见的过度自信相比有明显差异。

Conclusion: 时序基础模型在概率预测的校准性上具有鲁棒性，适用于需要可靠不确定性估计的应用，且在不同预测头和较长预测时间步下表现稳定。

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPURIN proposes a communication-efficient personalized federated learning framework by selecting critical parameters through an integer programming formulation and integrating this into sparse aggregation, achieving substantial communication reduction with competitive accuracy under non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data heterogeneity across distributed clients in PFL and the significant communication burden of many existing models, aiming to maintain performance while lowering communication costs.

Method: Use an integer programming formulation to identify the most informative parameters to transmit (critical parameters) and apply sparse aggregation to transmit only those parameters, thereby reducing communication. The approach is evaluated on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods while achieving measurable communication reductions via sparse aggregation across non-IID scenarios.

Conclusion: FedPURIN establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL by combining principled parameter selection with sparse aggregation, particularly benefiting edge intelligence systems with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于3D非结构化点云CFD的多尺度神经算子MNO，通过全局降维注意力、局部图注意力和微点注意力等三级模块实现跨尺度信息建模，在多项基准上显著优于现有方法，并对复杂几何的鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算子在处理不规则域的多尺度流场时，存在精度不足和可扩展性差的问题，难以高效地捕捉跨尺度的结构化行为。需要一种能够在3D非结构化点云上对流体动力学问题进行高精度且高效推断的模型。

Method: 提出MNO架构，将信息显式按三个尺度进行分解：全局降维注意力模块用于捕捉远程依赖关系；局部图注意力模块用于点云邻域内交互；微观点级注意力模块负责细粒度细节。通过在三层尺度上的注意力机制实现跨尺度的感知，同时保持计算效率，适用于大规模3D点云CFD。

Result: 在四个不同基准上评估，覆盖稳定态和非稳定态流动，点数规模高达30万。MNO在所有任务上持续优于最先进的基线，预测误差降低5%至40%，并在具有挑战性的3DCFD问题上表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 显式的多尺度设计对神经算子非常关键，MNO为在不规则域上学习复杂流体动力学提供了一个可扩展的框架，并展现出对大规模3D点云问题的有效性。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示影响Transformer训练性能提升的内在机制，并借助谱分析提供对训练过程的可解释性与监控能力。

Method: 以浅层自注意力矩阵V的谱密度为研究对象，观察其逐步进化为重尾分布；使用幂律拟合（PL）作为探针，将训练阶段划分为结构探索、重尾结构稳定和收敛饱和三个阶段，并提出两条一致的验证自由的指标。

Result: 发现V的谱密度在训练中呈现重尾特征，且三阶段划分与PL拟合指标对训练进程具有良好区分性；提出的两个谱分析指标与训练进展高度一致，支持在训练早期进行停顿决策与收敛判断。

Conclusion: 表明随机矩阵理论在监控和诊断Transformer训练进程方面具有实用性与解释力，能够为培训资源分配和训练策略提供量化的诊断工具。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Conclusion: FSRF有效缓解MSA中的模态缺失问题，提升了对缺失模态的鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在连续更新时的灾难性遗忘问题，同时实现无需全量再训练的持续适应能力。

Method: 使用LoRA进行参数高效微调并在候选编辑上应用门控：基于Exact Match下降、比特增增量和KL散度三种稳定性指标，对超阈值的编辑进行剪裁后再缩放或拒绝更新；在Qwen-2.5-7B上进行实验验证。

Result: 门控机制有效缓解遗忘并保持模型的适应性；在短序列中，基于EM的门控实现了最高的累计性能；不同门控策略在KL等分布偏移方面可能相近，但对最终精度有差异，显示门控设计的重要性。

Conclusion: STABLE提供了一个有原则的持续模型编辑框架，使LLMs在引入新知识的同时保持可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

TL;DR: MemCom is a layer-wise prompt compression method that reduces many-shot in-context learning prompts (3k-6k tokens) to m soft tokens per layer, enabling efficient inference with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many-shot in-context learning improves performance but incurs high memory and compute costs due to long prompts. Existing compression methods are ineffective for many-shot prompts, so there is a need for more powerful, layer-aware compression.

Method: Introduce MemCom, a layer-wise compression framework that compresses representations at each transformer layer using stronger trainable compressor models. It explores multiple compressor architectures and training strategies, applies per-layer compression across model sizes (2B and 7B) and architectures (Gemma, Mistral), and evaluates with many-shot sequences of 3k-6k tokens at compression ratios of 3x-8x.

Result: MemCom outperforms strong baselines across all tested compression ratios on multiple classification tasks with large label sets. Unlike baselines, whose performance degrades sharply at high compression, MemCom maintains high accuracy with minimal degradation (typically <10%).

Conclusion: Layer-wise, strong-compressor-based prompt compression enables efficient many-shot ICL with substantial memory/compute savings while preserving accuracy, applicable across model sizes and architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

Method: 通过将与时间相关的马尔可夫噪声分解为 Poisson 方程的解的马尔可夫-均差项与残差项，并对残差项在强时间异质性下进行控制；对Poisson解关于Q估计和学习策略的灵敏度进行分析，进而推导出最后迭代收敛率及相关速率。

Result: 给出 E[||Q_k - Q^*||_∞^2] 的收敛速率，并得到实现 E[||Q_k - Q^*||_∞] ≤ ε 的样本复杂度为 O(1/ε^2)；给出 E[||Q^{π_k} - Q^*||_∞^2] 的显式速率；数值实验与理论一致。

Conclusion: on-policy Q-learning 在探索性较弱的条件下仍能收敛至最优策略，且相较于离策略具有更强的开发（利用）优势；所采用的Poisson方程与灵敏度分析工具可推广到其他具有快速时间变化策略的RL算法，具有独立的理论与应用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过指数倾斜将一阶样本无梯度优化与尖锐度感知最小化（SAM）联系起来，提出带有倾斜参数 t 的软 SAM 目标，并给出对该框架的零阶优化算法与理论性质，实现在不使用梯度的情况下对 SAM 的近似优化，提升在分类、问答和语言生成等任务的泛化表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的零阶优化通常优化原函数的平滑版本（对模型参数的随机扰动下的期望目标），相当于希望一组扰动内部的损失值平均较小。与此相对，SAM 倾向于在邻域内最大化损失以获得更平滑的极小值。两者之间缺乏统一框架与实现路径，因此需要一个能在平均损失和最大损失之间平滑切换、且适用于零阶设定的目标。

Method: 提出一种带有倾斜参数 t 的软 SAM 目标，利用指数倾斜实现对平均损失与最大损失的平滑过渡；设计新的零阶算法以求解该软 SAM 目标；给出 Tilted SAM 框架下的尖锐度概念的精确表征。

Result: 该方法提供了一个无梯度且内存高效的 SAM 替代方案，相较于常规模型的零阶基线，在多类任务（包括分类、多项选择问答、语言生成）上具备更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过指数倾斜实现对 SAM 的平均损失与最大损失之间的连续权衡，建立了零阶优化中的软 SAM 框架以及相应的无梯度算法，同时在实验中展现出较传统零阶基线更优的泛化性。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

### [184] [Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161)
*Ankitkumar Joshi,Milos Hauskrecht*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRUwE: a simple GRU-based model with exponential basis functions for irregularly sampled multivariate time series, achieving competitive to state-of-the-art performance with lower complexity and online deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series and assess whether simple RNN-based approaches, when equipped with appropriate update/reset mechanisms, can rival more complex architectures in both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: GRUwE maintains a Markov state for the time series, updating on irregular observation arrivals. It employs two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset via learnable exponential decays, enabling continuous-time predictions. It supports both regression-based and event-based (next-observation/next-event) predictions.

Result: Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks show GRUwE is competitive with, and often superior to, recent SOTA methods for next-observation and next-event prediction, while offering reduced computational overhead and easier implementation with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: A lightweight, easy-to-implement RNN-based approach can achieve competitive performance on irregular-time-series tasks, with advantages in online deployment due to lower computation and tunability.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

TL;DR: CDVAE在晶体结构重建上的表现最好，其次是AtomGPT，FlowMM最弱；在JARVIS超导3D与Alexandria数据集上的KL散度和MAE指标中CDVAE领先，代码及模型配置将公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管存在多种生成模型用于材料探索，但对其在材料数据集上的系统性、横向对比评估仍然匮乏。本工作通过标准化基准测试来比较三种代表性生成模型在晶体结构重建任务中的性能，为模型选择与改进提供基线。

Method: 选取三种代表性模型：AtomGPT（基于Transformer）、CDVAE（变分自编码器的晶体扩散实现）与FlowMM（Riemannian流匹配模型），在公开的超导数据集（JARVIS Supercon 3D 与 Alexandria 的DS A/B）子集上训练以重建晶体结构。评估指标为：1) 预测与参考晶格参数分布的KL散度；2) 单个晶格常数的平均绝对误差（MAE）。

Result: 在计算得到的KLD与MAE分数上，CDVAE表现最佳，其次AtomGPT，FlowMM居于末位。研究方还宣布将把基准代码和模型配置公开于GitHub。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为材料领域的生成模型提供了可比基线，显示CDVAE在晶体参数分布拟合与单个晶格常数误差方面的优势；未来工作可进一步扩展数据规模、覆盖更多结构类型，并探讨不同评估指标对模型选择的影响。

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

TL;DR: RLHF 对齐在中层激活子空间实现，呈现低秩、方向性特征；仅少数层参与激活距离与奖励增益的线性关系，早/晚层影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示偏好优化在语言模型对齐中的具体机制，解释为何对齐似乎局部且可控，并为更高效、可解释的对齐方法提供线索。

Method: 在 Llama-3.2-1B 上通过跨基模型与微调模型之间的层级因果补丁分析，系统地对人类偏好对齐进行层级级别的因果干预；并使用 LASSO 回归将激活距离与奖励增益联系起来。

Result: 对齐表现出空间局部性：中间层激活编码一个可因果检测的子空间，决定奖励一致的行为；初/晚层基本不受影响；仅少数层具有非零系数，显示激活距离与奖励提升之间的关系是稀疏的。

Conclusion: 对于某些语言模型，人类偏好调优的对齐是一个方向性、低秩的过程，而非扩散式、参数化的过程，提示对齐可以更有针对性地实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

Motivation: 当前 RL 研究过于以在学术基准上的性能提升为目标，容易造成对新问题的迁移性下降和对学习动力学理解的不足。需要通过更清晰的基准映射和理解性研究来推动领域科学化发展。

Method: 提出两点主张： (i) 将研究重点从单纯提升能力转向理解学习动力学与科学性的提升； (ii) 更精确地界定基准（如 ALE）与其数学形式之间的映射关系，并以 ALE 为示例说明如何在理解性研究中使用该基准。

Result: 提出一个面向理解的 RL 研究方向框架，并展示 ALE 如何在理解与方法评估之间发挥作用，从而支持更稳健的实际应用。

Conclusion: RL 研究需要兼顾能力提升与科学理解；改进基准的表述和映射、鼓励非前沿性能的研究，以提升领域的可解释性和迁移性。

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励函数常把奖励视为状态-动作到标量的黑箱映射，缺乏对奖励为何给出的解释，且现有奖励机受限于正则语言，无法表达复杂行为如计数或参数化条件。

Method: 在奖励机框架中嵌入 RML 的记忆能力，构建一类基于语言的奖励机，能够描述非正则、非马可夫的奖励函数，具备灵活事件处理与任务规范能力。

Result: 通过实验展示该方法在表达能力上优于现有奖励机方法，能够处理更复杂的非马可夫任务，并提供更灵活的事件处理。

Conclusion: 扩展奖励机器的表达范围与可解释性，提升对复杂奖励设计的建模能力，为 RL 的奖励设计提供更强的工具。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Motivation: 现有强化学习在结构化任务的泛化能力有限；RRL往往对问题结构有较强假设，难以处理不同对象数量与非结构化数据。将对象中心表示用于灵活编码结构信息，并引入主动查询机制以利用专家知识，提升样本效率与鲁棒性。

Method: 将关系化RL与对象中心表示结合，构建能够处理结构化与非结构化数据的框架；对策略的不确定性进行建模，允许系统主动向人类专家请求指导以加速学习。通过实验评估验证其有效性与效率。

Result: 实证评估表明该框架在多种任务中具备有效性与学习效率提升，且展示了对不同数据结构的鲁棒性；对人类干预的依赖在可控范围内，同时实现更好的泛化。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为在结构化与非结构化数据之间搭建桥梁，提升RRL的泛化与数据效率，并通过不确定性建模与主动人类提示优化学习过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

*Sunmook Choi,Yahya Sattar,Yassir Jedra,Maryam Fazel,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores nonstationary bandits with action-influenced linear latent dynamics using an explore-then-commit strategy; achieves tilde O(T^{2/3}) regret; reduces long-horizon optimization to an NP-hard indefinite quadratic problem and offers SDP relaxations via Goemans–Williamson rounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many sequential decision problems, actions influence both immediate rewards and evolving latent states; learning these dynamics is essential to balance short-term vs long-term gains. The abstract addresses this by combining system identification with long-horizon planning under uncertainty.

Method: Employ random (Rademacher) exploration to estimate the Markov parameters of the latent linear dynamics; in the commit phase, leverage the estimates to design an action sequence that optimizes long-term reward. Theoretical results include near-optimal sample complexity for bilinear reward identification, a reduction to indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube with NP-hardness, a sub-optimality guarantee, and a practical SDP relaxation with Goemans-Williamson rounding.

Result: Regret bound of order tilde O(T^{2/3}); provides near-optimal system identification bounds; establishes NP-hardness of the long-horizon optimization and offers a tractable relaxation with performance guarantees.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled framework for nonstationary bandits with action-dependent state dynamics, combining rigorous learning guarantees with a practical optimization approach via semidefinite relaxation.

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Method: 将检测方法分解为标签一致性函数、聚合方法、信息获取方式（样本内 vs 样本外）三大组件。提出一个统一的基准任务：在数据集的噪声率下检测等比例的训练样本。引入在固定工作点的假阴性率（false negative rate, FNR）作为新指标。对视觉与表格数据集、包括合成与真实噪声条件，进行广泛评估。

Result: 在多数场景下，采用样本内信息获取、平均概率聚合、以及以对数边际（logit margin）作为标签一致性函数的组合，表现最佳。该发现为设计新检测方法和在具体应用中选择合适技术提供实用指引。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个可操作的、可扩展的检测框架和评估标准，能够帮助研究者和工程师在不同数据和噪声条件下选取合适的方法，并推动新方法的设计。

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy

*Danil Akhtiamov,Reza Ghane,Babak Hassibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-bit weight quantization in the Random Features model can be asymptotically lossless for generalization (except possibly the last layer), enabling significant speedups; the paper also provides a precise, layer-number-independent characterization of generalization error and claims stronger results than prior work, with empirical validation on a laptop GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of theoretical understanding of one-bit quantization in neural networks by studying a simplified Random Features model, to gain insights into compression and generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis in the asymptotic regime of Random Features, showing that quantizing all layers except the last does not worsen generalization; derive an asymptotically precise generalization error for networks with any number of layers; include empirical experiments demonstrating speedups on a laptop GPU.

Result: Asymptotically no loss in generalization when quantizing all layers except the last; a precise characterization of generalization error for arbitrarily many layers; empirical evidence of inference speedups on real hardware; claim of broader/general results than prior work.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical backing for one-bit weight compression in neural networks and suggest that aggressive quantization can retain performance while offering practical speedups, with broad implications beyond prior studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

*Arielle Sanford,Shuo Sun,Christian B. Mendl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-depth Evoformer using Neural ODEs replaces 48 discrete blocks, enabling constant memory via the adjoint method and adjustable runtime–accuracy with adaptive solvers, achieving plausible protein structure predictions while greatly reducing training resources (≈17.5 hours on a single GPU).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deep Evoformer (48 blocks) incurs high computational cost and rigid layerwise discretization. A continuous-depth formulation aims to reduce memory, enable adaptive computation, and maintain core attention-based operations.

Method: Replace the discrete 48-block Evoformer with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves attention-based operations. Use the adjoint method for constant memory backpropagation and adaptive ODE solvers to trade off runtime and accuracy.

Result: The Neural ODE–based Evoformer yields structurally plausible predictions, captures certain secondary structures like alpha-helices, but does not fully match the original architecture's accuracy. Training is substantially more resource-efficient, achieving about 17.5 hours on a single GPU.

Conclusion: Continuous-depth models are promising for efficient, adaptive protein structure prediction, offering a lightweight and more interpretable alternative, though some accuracy trade-offs remain compared with the original deep architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对视觉语言模型采用联合QKV权重的SVD降维，结合自适应秩分配与权重/激活量化，显著降低KV缓存和计算成本，同时在准确性上优于仅量化或仅SVD的方法，利于资源受限设备的实时部署；代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs具有高计算量和大内存开销，限制了实时应用和边缘部署。现有方法多聚焦于单一技术（如量化或SVD），未充分结合两者的互补性，需更高效且可部署的解决方案。

Method: 对联合的QKV权重矩阵进行SVD降维以压缩KV缓存；提出自适应秩分配策略，依据对VLM准确性的影响动态调整SVD秩；在此基础上对权重与激活进行量化，形成一个高效的VLM实现。

Result: 实现显著的内存与计算成本下降，相较于仅量化或仅SVD的方法，准确率提升超过10%，硬件成本更低，适合在资源受限设备上的实时部署。并提供开源代码。

Conclusion: 将SVD降维与量化结合，并通过自适应秩分配进行动态调控，能够在保持或提升准确性的同时显著提升效率，优于单一方法，便于现实场景中的实时应用与部署。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaffAug 提出一个三模块的支架感知虚拟筛选框架：生成性数据增强、基于自训练的模型融合，以及重排序以提升支架多样性，从而缓解类别不平衡、结构不平衡，并提升新颖活性分子的发现潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中的虚拟筛选常面临极低的活性分布，导致严重的类别不平衡；活性分子往往被少数支架支配，产生结构不平衡；且需发现结构多样的新颖活性分子。现有方法难以同时解决这三类挑战，因此需要整合生成、学习与重排策略来提升发现潜力。

Method: 提出三模块框架：1) augmentation 模块：使用图扩散模型在实际命中分子的支架条件下生成合成数据，并通过 scaffold-aware sampling 针对低频支架的活性样本进行偏重采样，缓解类别与结构不平衡；2) self-training 模块：以模型无关方式安全地将生成数据融入原标注数据，提升模型泛化；3) reranking 模块：在顶端推荐集上引入支架多样性提升策略，同时保持或提升对新颖活性分子的识别能力。

Result: 在五个目标类上进行系统计算实验，并与多种基线方法比较；通过多项评估指标展示性能提升，同时进行消融研究，证实三个模块的协同作用有助于提升活性发现、支架覆盖与新颖性。

Conclusion: ScaffAug 通过生成性增强、在支架层面的采样偏好与重排序等策略，提供一种可扩展的 scaffold-aware 虚拟筛选范式，有效缓解数据不平衡与结构偏向，并提升支架多样性与新颖活性分子的发现潜力。

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGTS-Net: Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting; introduces MFE, MFF, MSP to extract fine-grained temporal patterns, fuse multimodal info via heterogeneous graph, and multi-scale predictions; demonstrates superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Three challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns; suboptimal integration of multimodal information; limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features; need to improve forecasting accuracy with multimodal data.

Method: Three-layer design: 1) MFE optimizes feature encoders for temporal, visual, and textual modalities to capture fine-grained temporal patterns; 2) MFF builds a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment; dynamic multimodal knowledge aggregation; 3) MSP dynamically weights/fuses short-, medium-, long-term predictors to handle multi-scale features.

Result: Extensive experiments show MGTS-Net achieves superior performance with light weight and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MGTS-Net effectively addresses key challenges and validates the proposed approach for multimodal time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sparse transformer architecture integrates prior data distribution via regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, improving optimization convexity, promoting sparsity, and achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy than classical neural ODE-based methods in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To incorporate prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the transformer structure by leveraging a proximal operator of the regularized Wasserstein distance, addressing convexity and sparsity limitations of flow-based models.

Method: Derive a sparse transformer inspired by the closed-form solution of the regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, establishing a representation that aligns with transformer architectures, and analyze its theoretical properties.

Result: The proposed model improves convexity of the optimization problem, promotes sparsity in generated samples, and achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence to the target distribution compared to classical neural ODE-based methods, as demonstrated in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: Integrating optimal-transport priors into transformer designs yields a sparse transformer with superior optimization properties and sample efficiency for generative and inverse problems, suggesting a fruitful direction for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Input Domain Aware MoE，一种基于概率混合模型的新路由机制，改善 sMoE 的专家分配、提高任务性能与利用平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相似度的路由难以捕捉输入结构，导致专家专门化与负载均衡之间的权衡，限制可扩展性与性能。

Method: 将路由概率视为分布的混合，允许专家在输入空间形成清晰边界，同时实现负载平衡；路由器独立于任务目标进行训练，确保稳定优化与明确的专家分配。

Result: 在视觉-语言任务上，方法优于现有 sMoE，提升任务性能和专家利用平衡。

Conclusion: 通过概率混合路由实现更清晰的专家化和更好的资源利用，适用于大规模 vision-language 模型的 sMoE。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

TL;DR: 提出一个用于模仿学习的序贯强化学习框架，以捕捉蜜蜂等传粉者的异质认知策略，并通过轨迹相似性来预测跨个体的行为，能够识别有效记忆窗口、实现完整可解释性，并建立带有探索-开发动力学的带带算法框架，同时提供80只蜜蜂的新数据集以促进生物学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的模仿学习在多策略行为和策略随记忆窗口改变时难以泛化，同时缺乏可解释性，限制了对蜜蜂决策机制的生物学洞察。需要一个能识别记忆范围、兼具预测性与可解释性的模型来揭示不同个体的认知策略。

Method: 提出一个序贯强化学习的模仿学习框架，利用轨迹相似性来识别并预测依赖于不同策略的个体行为；在训练时同时识别有效记忆 horizon；确保模型可解释，使生物学家能够解析决策策略；并给出将 bee 策略搜索与带状（bandit）形式在不同探索-开发动态下的数学框架，并发布80只在不同天气条件下跟踪的蜜蜂数据集。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的模仿学习方法在策略随记忆窗口变化或偏离最优时难以捕捉快慢学习行为，也难以再现关键决策模式，且可解释性不足。所提方法通过预测损失最小化并识别最符合行为数据的记忆 horizon，实现了对行为模式的更准确预测与解释性分析，并提供了新的数据集以促进后续研究。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了连接蜜蜂策略搜索与带-式（bandit）模型的数学框架，在不同探索-开发动态下具有应用潜力，能提升对传粉者认知和生态系统仿真研究的能力，并通过发布数据集推动生态治理及农林业中的昆虫行为研究。

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应核注意力的分组特征处理架构，通过分组建模后再融合，在高维异质数据中同时捕捉局部模式和全局关系，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如PLS在高维、非线性及多尺度交互场景下表现受限；静态特征权重忽略样本特定相关性，局部处理难以捕捉跨组依赖。需要一种能自适应处理不同特征组、并同时建模局部与全局关系的架构。

Method: 提出自适应核基注意力机制的架构，先对不同特征组进行分组建模再进行整合；通过核方法实现非线性建模，强调局部模式捕捉与全局关系保持，支持跨组的多尺度交互，且具备对样本级相关性的自适应性。

Result: 在多数据集上与最先进方法相比，评估指标显示显著提升，证明了对复杂非线性和跨组依赖的有效建模。

Conclusion: 该架构克服了传统方法如PLS的局限，提升预测性能，体现对样本特定相关性和跨组交互的自适应建模能力。

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

### [203] [Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511)
*Dongchan Cho,Jiho Han,Keumyeong Kang,Minsang Kim,Honggyu Ryu,Namsoon Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OracleAD is an unsupervised, interpretable framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. It encodes each variable's past into a causal embedding to predict the present and reconstruct the input window, uses self-attention to map embeddings into a shared latent space, and aligns them to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) of normal relationships. Anomalies are detected via a dual score of prediction error and deviation from SLS, enabling per-time-point and per-variable root-cause diagnosis. It achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets while maintaining interpretability through SLS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Current methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks and may detect only fragments of anomalous segments, overstating performance. There is a need for a simple, interpretable unsupervised framework that captures temporal causality and evolving spatial relationships.

Method: For each variable, encode past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, thereby modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings pass through a self-attention mechanism to form a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships that are not static but emerge from each variable's temporal dynamics. The embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified with a dual scoring scheme based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and for individual variables. Root causes are pinpointed at the embedding level as deviations from learned temporal causality.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: OracleAD provides a simple, interpretable unsupervised framework that models temporal causality and evolving spatial relationships through causal embeddings and SLS alignment, enabling fine-grained anomaly detection and root-cause diagnosis while achieving strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

*Dhruv Gupta,Aditya Nagarsekar,Vraj Shah,Sujith Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于连接性因子（CF）的新型本征维度估计方法 eDCF，在不同尺度下保持鲁棒性，并具备良好的并行可扩展性。在带噪声和大规模数据集上，与主流估计器的MAE相当甚至更优，并且在中高噪声条件下获得更高的“完全匹配”本征维度比例，还能检测决策边界中的分形几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据通常具有复杂的依赖关系，难以通过单一尺度估计出数据集的内在维度（id）。在极细尺度上噪声会拉高id，在较粗尺度时id趋于稳定且尺度不变，因此需要一种对尺度鲁棒且可扩展的估计方法。

Method: 提出 eDCF，一种基于局部连通性度量 Connecting Factor 的方法，能跨越多尺度进行本征维度估计，且具备可并行实现。

Result: 在带噪声的合成基准数据上，MAE 与领先估计器相当；在“完全匹配”的本征维度方面，eDCF 最高达到 25.0%，优于 MLE 的 16.7% 与 TWO-NN 的 12.5%。在中高噪声及大规模数据集上表现尤为出色。此外，方法还能检测数据边界的分形几何，体现对真实结构数据的适用性。

Conclusion: eDCF 提供了一种鲁棒、可扩展的本征维度估计工具，能够在不同尺度下稳定估计并捕捉复杂几何结构，适合对高维、结构化数据进行有效分析。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前LLMs在因果发现上的高评估表现，强调数据泄露与记忆效应的风险，主张通过科学现实评估与混合方法提升因果发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动对LLMs在因果推断中是否真实具备推理能力的系统评估，防止依赖记忆数据的评估结论，并实现与数据驱动统计的融合以用于现实科学发现。

Method: 提出两点计划：P.1 基于最新科学研究在新的现实世界数据上评估以防止数据泄露；P.2 将LLM输出作为先验信息融入传统PC算法，提升因果发现的准确性，同时在严格的对照下比较LLM-only与纯统计方法。并给出从最新发表论文中提取因果图、确保训练截止后信息不被 memorized 的可执行方案。

Result: 在BNLearn等基准上，LLMs 的接近完美准确性不能代表真实能力；在经过筛选的现实世界图上，LLMs 表现显著下降。将LLM预测作为PC算法的先验可以显著提升准确性，超越仅LLM或纯统计方法。

Conclusion: 倡导采用科学、抗泄露的基准，并发展适用于现实世界探究的混合因果发现方法。

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Result: 给出一个阶段跃迁：当 n 个顶点的先验知识图被分裂为小连通分量时，沿着路径的 augmentation 查找效率低下，需要 Omega(sqrt(n)) 次查询；一旦正确知识密度超过某阈值，形成巨型连通分量，便可以期望常数次查询找到路径。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了先验知识密度的阈值效应对高效 augmentation 的决定性作用，为现实中的 RAG 等方法提供理论基础——提高初始知识的覆盖率能显著降低对外部检索的依赖。

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructureFlow jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics from partial, noisy observations without relying on simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where existing methods tackle structure learning and dynamics modeling separately, hindering mechanistic understanding of high-dimensional, stochastic systems.

Method: A simulation-free framework (StructureFlow) that integrates structure discovery with stochastic dynamics modeling, leveraging interventions and trajectory data to infer network structure and conditional population dynamics.

Result: Empirical validation on high-dimensional synthetic systems, biologically plausible simulated systems, and a real experimental single-cell dataset demonstrates accurate structure recovery and faithful conditional dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: StructureFlow enables principled, joint causal structure learning and dynamics modeling in challenging noisy, high-dimensional settings, advancing mechanistic insights in systems biology.

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将 PIsToN 的 Vision Transformer 替换为 Vision Mamba 后，PUMBA 在蛋白质-蛋白质接口评估中显著提升表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质对接评分函数需可靠区分原生与非原生复合物；PIsToN 虽强，但受限于 Transformer Backbone；Mamba 在长程建模方面具有潜在优势。

Method: 在 PIsToN 框架中将 Vision Transformer 骨干替换为 Vision Mamba，利用其对图像块的长程序列建模，提升全局与局部特征的捕捉；在公开大规模数据集上进行训练与评估。

Result: PUMBA 在多个广泛使用的公开数据集上，持续优于原始 Transformer 版本 PIsToN。

Conclusion: Vision Mamba 骨干提升了蛋白-蛋白质界面评分性能，证明了在对接打分任务中更强的全局-局部特征建模的价值；未来可进一步扩展到其他生物分子对接任务。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种在极少数据或高采样成本场景下的主动目标发现框架，利用可解释的生成模型与序列观测实现高效探索，并在每次新观测后实现前验估计的单调改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据获取昂贵且稀缺的领域，需要高效策略性采样来最大化发现率；现有基于强先验的生成模型在极端数据稀少时泛化能力不足且不易解释。

Method: 结合来自神经科学的启发，开发一个可解释的生成-model驱动的主动探索框架，通过逐步利用任务相关观测来引导查询，确保鲁棒性、可解释性，并保证前验估计随新观测单调改进。

Result: 在物种分布建模和遥感等多领域进行广泛实验与消融，方法显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法具备理论基础、可解释性与单调改进性质，提升在高成本数据场景下的探索效率与鲁棒性，适用于现实世界的动态探索任务。

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对MIT-BIH心率序列的两项任务（近端心动过速风险预测与下一步心率单步预测），比较GRU-D（RNN）与Transformer在同等预算下的性能。结论为：短期风险评分中紧凑型RNN具有竞争力，而点预测中紧凑型Transformer带来更明显收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严格因果、紧凑的流式临床时间序列基准上，使用每秒心率评估模型对齐评估，与非学习基线比较，并引入校准-aware评估（温度缩放、分组自举置信区间）以提高临床可解释性与可靠性。

Method: 在MIT-BIH Arrhythmia数据库上，进行非重叠的记录级分割，设定两项任务：近10秒的未来心动风险（tachycardia risk）与下一步心率预测（one-step forecasting）。在等预算条件下比较GRU-D（RNN）与Transformer，并与强基线方法比较；评估采用对分类的温度缩放与分组自举置信区间，强调标定与 forecasting 的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MIT-BIH 数据集上，GRU-D 在心动风险任务上略优于 Transformer；在心率预测任务中，Transformer 明显降低了预测误差，相对于 GRU-D 与持久性基线。总体而言，纵向监测中模型选择应依任务而定，紧凑型RNN在短期风险评分方面具备竞争力，紧凑型Transformer在点预测方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 模型选择应以任务为导向：短 horizon 的风险评分可优先考虑紧凑的RNN架构，而点预测任务则更适合使用紧凑的Transformer以获得更明显的预测收益。

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

*Shurong Lin,Eric D. Kolaczyk,Adam Smith,Elliot Paquette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过扩散过程的连续时间框架，对高维噪声SGD在差分隐私约束下的统计风险与隐私损耗的精确演化进行建模，并分析一种不需要显式梯度裁剪的变体，聚焦带L2正则的最小二乘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解噪声SGD在隐私保护下的动态行为是关键，但现有研究多给出统计风险和隐私损失的上/下界，缺乏在高维下的精确动力学描述。扩散方法提供一个连续时间视角，能够同时刻画风险演化和隐私损耗的演变。

Method: 将带噪声的SGD建模为扩散过程（SDE），在高维设定下推导统计风险与隐私损耗的演化方程；以最小二乘问题配合L2正则为研究对象，分析不需要显式梯度灵敏度的变体（非裁剪式），与传统需要梯度裁剪的方法进行对比。

Result: 给出风险和隐私损耗在连续时间上的精确动态描述，揭示高维下的行为规律；证明或展示不需要梯度裁剪的变体在理论上的可行性与性能特征；提供对带L2正则的最小二乘问题的适用性和理论解释。

Conclusion: 使用扩散框架可以对噪声SGD在差分隐私约束下的统计与隐私双重动态进行全面理解，且扩展到不依赖梯度裁剪的变体，尤其适用于带L2正则的最小二乘学习问题。

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

### [213] [On the Granularity of Causal Effect Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16703)
*Yizuo Chen,Adnan Darwiche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 状态变量的因果效应在可观测数据下有可能可辨识，即使传统的基于变量的因果效应不可辨识；是否可辨识取决于是否具备额外的知识，如情境特异独立性和条件函数依赖等。单独约束变量状态的知识并不能提高可辨识性，但与其他知识结合时可同时提升变量基和状态基的可辨识性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓展因果效应的可辨识性研究至状态层面，探究在对一个治疗变量的特定状态进行干预时，如何影响结果变量的特定状态，以及在何种附加知识条件下状态-基与变量-基的可辨识性会分离。

Method: 进行理论分析，比较状态基与变量基可辨识性的条件，涉及情境特异独立性、条件函数依赖等结构性知识；考察对变量状态的约束知识在单独使用时与与其他知识结合时对可辨识性的影响。

Result: 结果表明：在某些情形下，状态基因果效应可以在变量基不可辨识时仍然可辨识；两者的分离只有在存在额外知识（如情境特异独立性和条件函数依赖）时才出现。仅约束变量状态的知识并不提升单独的可辨识性，但当与其他知识（如情境特异独立性）结合时，可以同时提升变量基和状态基的可辨识性。

Conclusion: 强调在观测数据下，感兴趣的因果效应在某些情形下是可估计的，但若仅使用传统的变量基框架，可能会错过这些可辨识性。鼓励将状态基因因果推断纳入分析，并结合额外结构性知识以达到更广泛的可辨识性。

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Result: 在三个小规模NLP数据集上验证（最多含30条学习曲线），能够得到接近真实规模规律的预测，并实现零-shot预测与主动查询以减少不确定性；数据来源包括 nanoGPT、mBART 双语翻译与多语种 M2M100 模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在较低成本条件下提供概率化的学习曲线规模规律预测，便于设计与资源分配决策，具备对更大规模任务的扩展潜力。

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

TL;DR: 提出在 SegDeformer 上应用联合特征与任务解码来降低计算成本，同时在车载端和云端场景保持优秀分割性能，取得显著的帧率提升和参数量缩减，并在多数据集上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在语义分割中的高计算成本与带宽受限的云端传输，同时兼顾车载场景的实时性与云端的可扩展性。

Method: 设计并实现 SegDeformer 的联合特征与任务解码策略，使特征编码与解码过程共享并优化任务解码，降低整体计算，同时在车载与云端两端对比基线方法。

Result: 车载端：Cityscapes fps 1.4→16.5（增11.7x），ADE20K 43.3→154.3 fps（增3.5x），mIoU 与不压缩基线相当；云端：在大多数比特率下达到SOTAmIoU，云端参数仅占前端SOTA的0.14%（ADE20K）/0.04%（Cityscapes）。

Conclusion: 联合特征与任务解码可在不显著牺牲分割性能的前提下显著降低计算与带宽成本，从而提升两端的可扩展性与性能。

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

TL;DR: SAMOSA：基于典型性的数据主动学习查询方法，结合 Sharpness Aware Minimization，能在不增加额外计算开销的前提下，提升多数据集的准确性约3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模未标记数据中，开放集主动学习需筛选对目标类信息量大且能区分未知类的样本；数据的典型性对泛化有重要影响，现有方法难以同时兼顾信息性与分辨未知类的能力。

Method: 提出 SAMOSA，利用对数据典型性的理论理解，将查询策略建立在样本典型性上；结合 Sharpness Aware Minimization，定位接近决策边界的非典型样本并优先选取；筛选对目标类最具信息量且有助于区分目标类与非目标类的样本；且据称实现无额外计算开销。

Result: 在多个数据集上相比 SOTA，SAMOSA 提升准确性约3%，且不引入额外计算开销；代码公开.

Conclusion: SAMOSA 为开放集主动学习提供了一种有效的典型性引导的查询策略，结合 SAM 的鲁棒性，显著提升性能并保持计算效率。

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

TL;DR: 提出 3D-GSRD：一个用于3D分子图自编码的选择性再遮蔽解码框架，通过Selective Re-mask Decoding (SRD) 仅重遮蔽与3D相关的信息，同时保留2D图结构；结合3D Relational-Transformer 编码器与结构无关解码器，在MD17数据集上实现7/8目标的最新最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将掩碼图模型（MGM）扩展到3D场景时，面临两大冲突挑战：一是避免把2D结构信息泄露到解码器，从而破坏对3D信息的学习；二是需要提供足够的2D上下文帮助重构被掩蔽的原子。需在3D信息利用与2D结构保留之间取得平衡，使模型能充分利用3D信息提升MRL。

Method: 提出 Selective Re-mask Decoding (SRD)，仅从编码器表示中重掩蔽与3D相关的信息，同时保持原有2D图结构。将 SRD 与一个3D Relational-Transformer 编码器（3D-ReTrans）以及结构独立的解码器相结合，SRD 配合结构无关解码器可以增强编码器在分子表示学习中的作用，提升鲁棒性与表达能力。

Result: 在广泛实验中，3D-GSRD 在 MD17 分子属性预测基准上实现了对8个目标中的7个的最新最佳性能（SOTA），表现显著提升。

Conclusion: SRD 与结构无关解码器的组合有效平衡了3D信息利用与2D上下文的保留，增强了编码器在3D分子表示学习中的作用，提升下游任务的性能。代码公开，便于复现与扩展。

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择忽略计算预算，导致不同预算下算法表现不稳定，需将预算约束融入数据选择策略。

Method: 将数据选择建模为双层优化；在外层根据模型评估优化数据子集，在内层在预算约束下训练模型。为解决外层梯度的高成本，采用概率重参数化与Hessian-free策略梯度估计；将内层最优性转化为外层目标的惩罚项，并仅需估计一维损失的最小值以计算梯度。

Result: 在视觉与语言基准上，相比基线提升可达14.42%。

Conclusion: 将计算预算纳入数据选择的核心，提升在不同预算下的稳定性与效果，并实现更高的计算效率。

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former 通过第一层 Value 头引入跳连，在降低 KV 缓存约 25% 的同时提升表征能力；并可对现有 MHA 模型进行低成本升级。与 YOCO 组合时，KV 缓存可近乎再降 50%，且可与 Group-Query Attention、Multi-Latent Attention 等方法叠加以获得进一步性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 在自回归解码中对 KV 缓存和显存的需求高，现有跳连要么提升表征表达力但不降低 KV 开销，要么降低内存/计算时牺牲表现。需要在保持或提升表示能力的同时显著减少 KV 缓存。

Method: 提出 SkipV1Former：自第二层起，每层复用第一层 Value 头的一半，同时对另一半按常规计算；因此降低 Value 投射和 KV 缓存近 50%。理论上，直接路由第一层未压缩 Value 到深层能恢复被压缩的信息并加速自回归任务中的隐式 mesa-optimization。实证上在多种模型尺寸上实现约 25% 的 KV 缓存下降并提升 perplexity，相比标准 MHA 与部分先进变体。还给出对现有 MHA 检查点的 10-15% 额外计算的“upsampling/uptraining”方案，并可无缝结合 Group-Query Attention、Multi-Latent Attention 等方法，结合 YOCO 时 KV 缓存降低接近 50%。

Result: 在多模型规模上，SkipV1Former 实现约 25% 的 KV 缓存下降，同时对困惑度有提升；与 YOCO 等组合可将 KV 缓存近似降低 50%，且获得更好或相近的性能提升。提出基于现有 MHA 的低成本升级路径（10-15%额外计算）。

Conclusion: SkipV1Former 提供了一种在降低 KV 缓存和提升表征能力之间取得平衡的 Transformer 变体，且易于与其他高效注意力机制结合，从而实现更高效的自回归推理与模型升级。

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

### [220] [Graph Learning is Suboptimal in Causal Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16811)
*Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Jalal Etesami,Negar Kiyavash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在未知因果结构的因果Bandit中，单纯学习父集以致奖回报并非最优；提出跳过父集恢复的近似最优算法，建立新的下界并通过实验显示对比基线的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对象是未知因果结构下的 regret 最小化问题，现有方法要么先识别奖励的父集再做Bandit，要么边学习边最小化 regret。作者质疑父集学习的最优性，旨在寻找直接优化 regret 而不依赖父集识别的策略。

Method: 1) 证明存在实例使得 regret 最小化与父集识别互相矛盾，难以同时优化；2) 针对已知与未知父集大小两种情形，推导出刻画动作空间组合结构的新的 regret 下界；3) 给出几乎最优的算法，绕过图结构与父集恢复，达到接近最优的 regret。

Result: 获得新的下界，揭示父集学习在某些情形下并非最优；提出绕过父集识别的近最优算法，理论上接近最小可实现 regret；实验结果显示所提方法相较现有基线在多种环境中具有显著性能优势。

Conclusion: 结论是：在因果Bandit中，父集识别并非必要，直接进行 regret 最小化的算法能够实现更优的性能，且算法对未知/已知父集大小均具鲁棒性；研究为因果Bandit设计提供新的思路，强调利用结构信息而非显式的父集恢复。

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

TL;DR: 提出一个半监督正负样本学习的语义分割模型，结合动态伪标签和CRF-RNN后处理，在考古预测中对DEM与卫星影像数据实现与SOTA相当甚至更优的Dice，并提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考古学中的阳性样本稀缺、未标记数据占多数，需有效利用大量未标记数据来预测潜在遗址的环境、文化与时空特征。

Method: 采用正-未标记学习的语义分割框架，结合动态伪标签更新、CRF实现的RNN后处理以提升标签置信度，在DEM地理数据和原始卫星影像上进行端到端评估，包含分层k折交叉验证。

Result: 在DEM数据集上与最先进方法LAMAP等效或优于之，且Dice分数更高；在原始卫星影像端到端评估中保持性能并获得更具解释性的预测表面。

Conclusion: 半监督学习在大尺度、标注稀疏的考古遗址发现任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Motivation: 解决全数据集微调成本高、易过拟合/偏置放大，以及现有在线批次选择方法在多样性、外部资源和额外训练时间方面的不足。

Method: 提出 UDS 框架，利用日志 logits 矩阵的核范数同时刻画数据效用与样本内多样性；通过对历史样本的轻量级记忆缓冲进行低维嵌入比较来估计样本间多样性；无需外部资源，也不需要额外的反向传播来筛选数据。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，UDS 在不同数据预算下持续超越现有在线批次选择方法，显著降低与全数据集微调相比的训练时间；代码公开。

Conclusion: UDS 提供了一种无外部资源、低开销的高效在线批次选择框架，提升 SFT 的数据利用率和训练效率。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

### [223] [Trace Regularity PINNs: Enforcing $\mathrm{H}^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial Ω)$ for Boundary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16817)
*Doyoon Kim,Junbin Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRPINN introduces a Trace Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network that enforces the boundary loss in the H^{1/2} trace norm on ∂Ω, reducing cost by using only the essential semi-norm portion and avoiding certain denominator evaluations. It proves convergence to the H^1 solution via exact boundary norm and NTK analysis, and shows faster convergence than standard PINNs with Laplace problems under oscillatory Dirichlet data; achieves 1–3 digit accuracy improvements in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve boundary condition enforcement in PINNs by using the correct trace space H^{1/2} on the boundary, ensuring convergence to the H^1 solution, while reducing computational cost and enhancing stability. Leverage NTK analysis to compare convergence and demonstrate robustness for challenging boundary data (e.g., highly oscillatory Dirichlet conditions).

Method: Augment PINN training with a boundary loss computed in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij H^{1/2}(∂Ω) norm, i.e., enforcing the correct trace space for H^1(Ω). Compute only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm to cut cost and avoid problematic denominator evaluations. Use the exact H^{1/2}(∂Ω) norm to guarantee convergence to the true H^1(Ω) solution, and employ Neural Tangent Kernel analysis to argue faster convergence than standard PINNs.

Result: The method achieves convergence to the true solution in the H^1(Ω) sense. NTK analysis suggests faster convergence than standard PINNs. Numerical tests on Laplace’s equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary data show cases where TRPINN succeeds where standard PINNs fail, with improvements in accuracy of about 1–3 decimal places.

Conclusion: Enforcing the correct trace boundary norm in PINNs via TRPINN improves boundary accuracy, stability, and overall convergence. It reduces computational cost by focusing on the essential semi-norm portion, and, supported by NTK analysis, can outperform standard PINNs on challenging boundary data scenarios, as demonstrated for Laplace problems.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个面向LLM生成的优化模型的组件级评估框架，扩展到变量与约束的精确度/召回、约束与目标的RMSE，以及基于token与延迟的效率指标；在不同复杂度问题、六种提示策略下对GPT-5、LLaMA 3.1 Instruct、DeepSeek Math进行评估，显示GPT-5表现最好，提示策略为链式推理/自我一致性/模块化 prompting；约束召回率和RMSE对求解器性能影响最大，简洁输出有助于效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估通常以整体解的最优性或运行时等粗粒度指标衡量，未能揭示结构性或数值性错误。本研究旨在提供一个可诊断、面向组成部分的评估框架，提升对LLM生成的优化模型的理解与改进。

Method: 提出多种新指标（变量/约束的精确度与召回、约束/目标的RMSE、基于token/延迟的效率指标等），在六种提示策略下对三种模型在不同复杂度的优化问题进行实验比较。

Result: GPT-5在各指标上总体领先，链式推理、自我一致性、模块化提示等策略最有效。求解器性能与高约束召回率和低约束RMSE呈显著相关性，结构正确性与解的可靠性取决于此。约束精确度与决策变量指标作用相对次要，简洁输出提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 框架为对LLM在优化建模中的诊断性评估奠定基础，并提出三个原则：完全覆盖约束以防止违反、最小化约束RMSE以确保求解器精度、输出简洁以提升效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

### [225] [Forgetting to Forget: Attention Sink as A Gateway for Backdooring LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17021)
*Bingqi Shang,Yiwei Chen,Yihua Zhang,Bingquan Shen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Backdoor unlearning: a hidden trigger can cause LLMs to regain forgotten knowledge when activated, leveraging attention sink positions to persist the backdoor while seeming normal otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As open-weight LLMs proliferate, ensuring safe unlearning is crucial, but a backdoored unlearning process could undermine trust; explore feasibility and mechanisms of backdoor unlearning.

Method: The study analyzes trigger placement, reinforcement, and attention patterns; identifies attention sinks (shallow tokens attracting attention) as gateways; designs backdoor training to align attention on triggers; conducts extensive experiments on unlearning scenarios; provides code.

Result: Backdoor unlearning can reliably restore forgotten knowledge when triggers are present; remains indistinguishable from normal unlearning when triggers are absent; attention sink alignment increases backdoor persistence; demonstrates a practical vulnerability.

Conclusion: Attention sinks robustly mediate backdoor unlearning; detection and mitigation require monitoring attention patterns and guardrails in unlearning pipelines; the work offers a realistic threat model and a GitHub resource.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for
integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit
innovation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 一個統一基準測試LLM在多回合對話中揭示並利用隱性用戶屬性能力的基準，涵蓋20問遊戲、個性化問答與個性化文本總結；表現範圍廣泛，為研究個性化交互中的隱性偏好推斷提供框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有LLMs的廣泛性限制了滿足用戶個性化需求的能力，需要在對話中推斷未被明示的偏好，從而提升系統的適應性。

Method: 提出三方框架（用戶、助手、評判）進行逐回合評價，設計三個現實場景（20 Questions、個性化問答、個性化文本摘要）以評估在對話中揭示與利用隱性屬性的能力，提供統一的回合級評估框架。

Result: LLMs確實能通過對話揭示隱性信息，但成功率受任務複雜度、主題與隱性屬性數量影響，介於32%到98%之間；首次提供了系統化框架用於研究個性化互動中的隱性信息發現。

Conclusion: 有效的偏好推斷仍是研究前沿，該基準為在個性化交互中研究隱性信息發現提供基礎，有助於構建更具適應性的AI系統。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniGTE是一种将结构感知的编码器-解码器与指令微调结合的框架，通过引入对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力，在不微调解码器的情况下实现对图任务的零-shot推断，并在节点、边、图级任务上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作在无任务特异监督下很难泛化至未见过的图任务；常规GNN往往绑定于固定标签空间；而大语言模型在处理图结构时能力受限。需要一个统一框架，将图结构与语言语义整合以实现跨任务、跨领域的鲁棒推理。

Method: 在预训练自回归LLM上增加可学习的对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力，使编码器能够对图令牌化表示和任务提示进行联合注意，并对节点顺序保持置换不变性，产生紧凑的任务感知图表示。解码器为冻结的LLM，基于该表示输出答案并同时将输入图用自然语言重述，以重建目标作为正则化，促使编码器保留结构线索。对五个数据集的节点级、边级、图级任务进行指令微调，推理阶段无需微调。

Result: 在零-shot场景下，UniGTE在节点分类、链接预测、图分类和图回归等任务上实现了新的SOTA，且具备跨任务和跨领域的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将图结构与LLM语义紧密结合的指令微调框架，能够在无需任务特定监督的情况下实现鲁棒且可迁移的图推理。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种语言在环的贝叶斯优化框架，使用大语言模型将自然语言反馈转换为标量效用，从而在数值搜索空间上进行BO，提升在反馈受限场景下的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，复杂、主观目标需要转化为可量化的优化目标；对比偏好式BO等方法，现有方法受限于反馈格式或需要域定制模型；需要一个自然界面，保留BO的样本效率与不确定性量化。

Method: 通过一个语言-环框架，利用LLM把非结构化的文本反馈转化为标量效用信号，进行BO；支持引入灵活的用户先验，无需手动核设计；与传统BO和仅LLM优化器对比，保持样本效率和不确定性；在反馈有限情况下效果特别好。

Result: 实验或分析表明该混合方法在对比基线和LLM-only优化器时表现更好，尤其在反馈有限的场景下。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为决策者提供更自然的接口，同时维持BO的理论优点，适用于多种反馈类型，且在反馈受限时具有显著优势。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Motivation: 现实世界需要模型在动态环境中持续学习新技能并在多样且未见的情景中泛化。现有的持续学习方法多假设训练—测试在同一领域，难以在 DGCL 场景中取得良好表现，因此需要在获取、保留和利用语义与领域信息之间实现更强的域泛化能力。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，DoT 能显著提升若干 CL 基线在 DGCL 设置下的表现，验证其能积累域泛化知识，并具备资源效率优势。

Conclusion: DoT 为以 PTMs 为基础的 DGCL 提供一种有效且可插拔的解决方案，易于与现有 CL 方法结合，支持全参数和轻量化微调，具有良好的域泛化能力和资源友好性。

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

### [231] [Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17776)
*Jackson Harmon,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个样本级的遗忘与回传衡量框架，用以量化预训练知识在后训练后的遗忘与回传效应。结果显示：领域连续预训练引发中等遗忘、对数学/逻辑的回传处于中到大；RL/SFT和指令调优在小规模到大规模数据下的效应差异显著；模型合并并不能可靠缓解遗忘；该框架提供了一个实用的基准来映射后训练对知识的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模后训练推动了语言模型的能力提升，仍不清楚它对已学的预训练知识有何影响。遗忘并非同类事物的简单平均，因此需要一个样本级的、可区分具体事实的度量框架，以揭示哪些知识被遗忘、何时发生以及是否存在回传效应。

Method: 提出一个逐样本的度量，将1→0转换（训练前正确、训练后错误）用于遗忘，0→1转换用于 backward transfer。对于多选题基准，加入机会校正以减去随机 guessing 的贡献。将该框架应用于不同后训练阶段、模型规模和数据规模，比较领域连续预训练、RL/SFT、指令调优等情形，并评估模型合并。

Result: 分析发现：1) 领域连续预训练导致中等程度的遗忘，且回传效应从低到中等；2) 对基础模型进行的 RL/SFT/指令调优，在数学与逻辑任务上呈现中到大程度的回传，同时整体遗忘程度从低到中等；3) 对指令调优后再进行 RL/SFT，在数据规模较小时遗忘与回传均较小；在较大规模下效果混合，需要结合更严格的对照；4) 模型合并并未可靠地缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为映射后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了一个实用的测量基准，有助于推动面向通用能力的AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolverLLM is a training-free framework that uses test-time scaling and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy to generate mathematical formulations and solver-ready code for diverse optimization problems, achieving strong generalization without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of prompt engineering and costly supervised training by enabling generalizable optimization problem solving with LLMs at test time.

Method: A training-free approach that employs a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation using outcome feedback to guide exploration, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to factor reward reliability into decisions, translating formulations into solver-ready code.

Result: Empirical evaluation on six standard benchmark datasets shows SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, demonstrating strong generalization without extra training.

Conclusion: A scalable, training-free framework that harnesses adaptive search to generate formulations and executable solver code, enabling robust optimization problem solving with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Motivation: 解决 Transformer 优化景观中缺乏对 LayerNorm 和前馈 Hessian 的系统理论结果的问题，填补对曲率传播、收敛动力学以及大模型性能尺度法则的理论空白。

Method: 推导 LayerNorm 和前馈子层的显式二阶表达；在此基础上扩展对 Transformer 全块的 Hessian 表征，结合已有的自注意力分析，对各子层在曲率传播中的作用进行估计；并提出基于 Taylor 展开的损失差分析框架，用以量化收敛轨迹。

Result: 给出全 Transformer 块的 Hessian 结构；提供各子层在曲率传播中的作用估计；阐明这些 Hessian 结构对收敛动力学和大模型尺度法则的影响；提出用于分析损失差和收敛路径的 Taylor 展开框架。

Conclusion: 将 Hessian 理论扩展至完整的 Transformer 架构，为大规模深度学习中的优化理论与经验研究奠定新的基础。

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

TL;DR: 引入概率性 Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN)，对时间序列预测的概率扩展。通过样条形函数连接替代标量权重、直接参数化预测分布，在参数高效的同时捕获非线性和重尾动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要在参数高效的情景下获得不确定性感知的时间序列预测，尤其是在资源受限的领域（如卫星通信）中。

Method: 将权重替换为样条函数的功能连接并直接参数化预测分布，构建Gaussian和Student-t两种分布的P-KAN；在卫星流量预测任务中评估。

Result: 相较于MLP基线，在准确性和校准方面均有提升，且参数数量显著更少，实现了更优的效率-风险权衡；Gaussian版提供保守稳健的预测，适合安全关键场景；Student-t版在需求稳定时给出更尖锐的分布，提高效率。

Conclusion: P-KAN为概率化时间序列预测提供一个强有力的框架，直接应用于卫星通信及其他资源受限领域，兼具不确定性表征和参数高效性。

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于三种概率性下尺度模型（QRNN、VAE、扩散模型）的风速概率性下尺度，可利用大尺度预测（如Z500）提升子季节预测的空间不确定性表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子季节预报依赖高可预测性的大尺度变量，但基于模型残差的简单随机扰动无法充分捕捉空间相关性和物理一致性，因此需要更强的概率性模型来刻画大尺度预测与局地风场之间的复杂关系。

Method: 以ERA5再分析数据训练，在ECMWF子季节预报上回归概率风速集合，比较Quantile Regression Neural Network、Variational Autoencoders、Diffusion Models三种不同的概率性建模及其不确定性量化机制。

Result: 相较于简单的随机扰动，概率性下尺度提供更为真实的空间不确定性表示；三种模型各自展现对集合分散、确定性技能和物理一致性的不同优势。

Conclusion: 证明了概率性下尺度是提升子季节风预测可用性与风电等应用的有效方法，适用于能源规划与风险评估。

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在小到中等维度、连续数据的线性回归场景中，提出适用于高斯DP的偏差校正估计量及其渐近置信区间，并给出一个通用的合成数据生成（SDG）流程，使合成数据在回归分析上与DP回归保持一致性；并通过分箱聚合策略提升小样本下的推断稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于差分隐私线性回归的研究多聚焦点估计与大数据场景，且针对连续数据的合成数据生成方法有限，往往不提供不确定性量化或在小样本下的可应用性。需要一个在高斯DP约束下兼具有效推断和可重复数据生成的框架。

Method: 提出一个DP偏差校正的回归估计量，并推导其在高斯DP下的渐近置信区间；引入分箱-聚合(bin-aggregation)策略以提升小到中维数据的稳健性；提出一个通用的DP合成数据生成流程，使在合成数据上进行的回归分析与真实DP回归结果对齐。

Conclusion: 为小规模、连续型社会科学数据提供一个在高斯DP约束下的可检验推断和合成数据生成框架，重点在分箱聚合策略对小样本的适用性与稳定性。

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

### [238] [MuonBP: Faster Muon via Block-Periodic Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16981)
*Ahmed Khaled,Kaan Ozkara,Tao Yu,Mingyi Hong,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuonBP reduces communication overhead of gradient orthogonalization in model-parallel training by performing blockwise orthogonalization on each device's gradient shards and periodic full orthogonalization to preserve stability, with a two-timescale learning-rate scheme. It maintains competitive iteration complexity with Muon while achieving throughput comparable to AdamW; in an 8B model with 8-way tensor parallelism, MuonBP delivers ~8% throughput gain over Muon without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient orthogonalization speeds up gradient descent but incurs extra communication cost in model-parallel setups due to gather/scatter of gradient matrix shards. This overhead can reduce throughput relative to coordinate-wise optimizers like AdamW.

Method: Apply orthogonalization independently to local gradient matrix shards on each device (blockwise/column-wise within each shard). Periodically perform a full orthogonalization across all shards to maintain stability at scale. Introduce two stepsizes: one for blockwise orthogonalization steps and one for the full orthogonalization steps. Adjust the global learning rate from the baseline Muon to MuonBP. Provide convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithm.

Result: MuonBP achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon, while delivering per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such as AdamW. In experiments with an 8B model using eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO optimizer state sharding, MuonBP yields an 8% throughput increase over Muon without degrading performance.

Conclusion: MuonBP offers a practical and scalable variant of gradient orthogonalization that reduces communication overhead in model-parallel training while preserving convergence properties and performance. Its two-timescale learning-rate scheme and blockwise-orthogonalization approach simplify hyperparameter tuning and enable throughput gains similar to AdamW.”

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Graph4MM：在多模态学习中引入基于图的多跳结构信息，通过 Hop-Diffused Attention 和 MM-QFormer 实现跨模态融合，提升对比基线的平均性能约 6.93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的多模态数据存在复杂的跨模态和单模态内部结构关系，图能够提供结构信息。但以往工作往往忽视多跳邻居的区别，将图作为单一模态处理，导致理解碎片化。因此需要在基础模型中整合结构信息并以 principled 的方式融合模态特异信息。

Method: 提出 Hop-Diffused Attention：通过因果屏蔽和跳数扩散将多跳结构信息融入自注意力；设计 MM-QFormer：一个多映射查询的跨模态融合 Transformer；并进行理论与经验分析，展示结构化信息帮助联合建模。

Result: 在生成式和判别式任务上 Graph4MM 超越了更大规模的 VLMs、LLMs 与多模态图基线，平均提升约 6.93%。理论分析与实验证明了将结构信息用于整合 intra-/inter-modal 关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 在基础模型时代，利用结构信息统一建模 intra-和 inter-modal 关系能提升多模态理解；Graph4MM 展示了有效性和潜在的泛化能力，鼓励后续将图结构融入多模态与基础模型的设计。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

Motivation: 现有基于 LLM 的拓扑/器件尺寸设计多以文本网表为主，缺乏直观可视化的原理图，影响设计者理解与验证。

Method: 将文本、视觉、符号模态融合的多模态大语言模型用于将 SPICE 转换为可编辑的原理图；使用六个模拟子结构做 few-shot 布局示例，提出 Visual Chain-of-Thought（VCoT）策略迭代优化布线与对称性。

Result: 在代表性放大电路（CMOS inverter、5T-OTA、telescopic cascode amplifier）上测试，显示原理图具有高视觉质量与结构正确性。

Conclusion: EEschematic 提升了放大类电路原理图的可视化可读性和正确性，促进基于多模态信息的自动原理图生成与验证。

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

TL;DR: DICA 通过 Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) 在未知非线性混合中识别潜在分量，强调对观测变量影响力的多样性，不依赖辅助信息、潜在独立性或雅可比稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知非线性混合中识别潜在分量是基础挑战。现有的非线性独立成分分析(nICA)常需要辅助信号或对雅可比矩阵的稀疏性等强假设。本文旨在利用混合函数雅可比矩阵的凸几何结构，放宽条件以实现可辨识性。

Method: 提出 Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA) 框架，利用 Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) 准则，通过鼓励潜在分量对观测变量的影响力多样性来实现识别。理论上在合理条件下无需辅佐信息、潜在分量独立性或雅可比稀疏性，即可达到可辨识性。

Result: 在不依赖额外信息的情况下实现潜在分量的可辨识性，并扩展可辨识性分析的范围，提供了对现有方法的互补视角。

Conclusion: 为非线性ICA 的可辨识性分析提供新维度，DICA 的思路可促进表示学习和因果推断等应用；未来工作可能集中在具体算法实现、实验验证及对更广场景的推广。

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

Result: 发现模型存在系统性的有动机推理，能够生成看似合理但实际上违背指令的辩解；前沿推理模型能被大多数 Frontier 模型检测到，但较小的判定模型可能漏检部分推理，且在极端情况下判定模型也可能被说服；随着模型的进阶，监控检测能力可能减弱。

Conclusion: 需要在基于链式推理的评估与监督中考虑有动机推理的存在，并改进检测与抑制策略；同时公开代码以便复现与扩展研究。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种面向未来硬件的低精度对数固定点训练方案：使用新的分段线性对数加法近似并通过 simulated annealing 在不同精度下优化；在 VGG-11/16 及 CIFAR-100/TinyImageNet 上以 12 位整数量化训练，准确率降幅很小；硬件评估显示相较线性固定点，LNS 乘累加单元的面积和能耗显著降低（最高 32.5%/53.5%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习仍以高精度浮点训练为主，低精度训练在硬件实现方面面临精度-效率的折中。为未来专用加速器设计，需开发能适应不同比特宽度的近似算术与高效实现。

Method: 提出一种硬件友好的分段线性近似用于对数加法，并将比特宽度纳入近似设计中。通过 simulated annealing 在不同精度水平对近似进行优化；使用 C++ 的逐比特仿真对 VGG-11（CIFAR-100）与 VGG-16（TinyImageNet）进行训练，均使用 12 位整数算术。

Result: 12 位整数训练在与 32 位浮点训练相近的准确性下降很小。硬件结论显示相比线性固定点，LNS 乘法累加单元的面积降低最高 32.5%，能耗降低最高 53.5%。

Conclusion: 引入可变比特宽的对数近似与分段线性设计，可显著提升低精度对数固定点训练的硬件友好性，同时维持可接受的模型精度，具备在未来硬件加速器中的应用潜力。

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

### [245] [Data Reliability Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17085)
*Yiling Chen,Shi Feng,Paul Kattuman,Fang-Yi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Gram determinant score to evaluate dataset reliability without ground truth, yielding a dataset ranking that is agnostic to the observation experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many data collection scenarios, true data are unobserved and outcomes depend on unknown experiments; there is a need for a benchmark that ranks data reliability across datasets from potentially strategic sources.

Method: Define ground-truth-based reliability orderings and introduce the Gram determinant score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical distribution of observed data and experiment outcomes. It preserves ground-truth orderings and is unique up to scaling across experiments (experiment-agnostic).

Result: Empirical validation on synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data shows that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality across diverse observation processes.

Conclusion: The Gram determinant score provides a robust, experiment-agnostic metric for reliability ranking of datasets when ground truth is not accessible.

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

### [246] [On the Universal Near Optimality of Hedge in Combinatorial Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17099)
*Zhiyuan Fan,Arnab Maiti,Kevin Jamieson,Lillian J. Ratliff,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在任意 X ⊆ {0,1}^d 的组合设定中，Hedge 的下界为 Ω(√(T log|X| / log d))，这意味着在维度 d 下其并非对所有情形都最优。对于某些 m-集合（log d ≤ m ≤ √d）该下界达到紧界，且 Hedge 相对于最优存在 √log d 的劣势。另一方面，在在线多任务学习中 Hedge 是最优的。通过将 Online Mirror Descent (OMD) 使用 dilated entropy 正则化器，DAG 的最短路径问题中与 Hedge 迭代等价，从而获得近似最优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统地研究 Hedge 在组合设定下的最优性，回答它在一般情形是否达到理论极限的问题，并将其与在线多任务学习和 DAGs 的问题联系起来。

Method: 给出对任意 X ⊆ {0,1}^d 的下界 Ω(√(T log|X| / log d)) 的证明；识别 log d ≤ m ≤ √d 的 m 集合使下界紧致且 Hedge 相对于最优存在 √log d 的劣势；证明 online multitask learning 下 Hedge 的最优性；构建在 DAGs 的最短路径问题中使用 dilated entropy 的 OMD 与 Hedge 的迭代等价性，从而得到近似最优的正则化与结果。

Result: 得到的核心结论包括：1) 任意算法在该设定下都受到了 Ω(√(T log|X| / log d)) 的下界约束；2) 某些 m 集合下，下界紧致且 Hedge 相对于最优的劣势为 √log d；3) 在线多任务学习中 Hedge 是最优的；4) 在 DAGs 的最短路径问题中，使用 dilated entropy 的 OMD 与 Hedge 迭代等价，因此可获得近似最优的 regret 保证。

Conclusion: 总体而言，Hedge 在广义的组合设定下近似最优，但并非在所有情形都最优。通过特定正则化（dilated entropy）和与 Hedge 的迭代等价性，在 DAGs 等领域可以实现近似最优的学习性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

*Shinji Ito,Kevin Jamieson,Haipeng Luo,Arnab Maiti,Taira Tsuchiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 首次给出末尾时期分段式马尔可夫决策过程在聚合带痕反馈下的最佳-两世界(BOBW)算法，在知道转移的情形下实现随机环境O(log T)遗憾、对抗环境O(sqrt(T))遗憾，并给出匹配下界；扩展到未知转移时通过置信区间等技术实现近似最佳BOBW；并提出了面向最短路问题的带bandit反馈的个体间隙下界和近最优BOBW算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在聚合带反馈（每轮只观测一整轮的累计损失）下，研究求解episodic MDP的最佳-两世界学习，以实现对随机与对抗环境的低遗憾并具有理论最优性。该问题此前仅有单一 worst-case 结果，缺乏对BOBW的系统探索。

Method: 在已知转移时，使用基于FTRL的占用测度优化、自界定（self-bounding）技巧，以及受在线最短路径研究启发的新损失估计器来构建BOBW算法；在未知转移时，结合置信区间方法扩展。核心工具包括FTRL、占用测度、以及新颖的损失估计策略。

Result: 给出在已知转移下的BOBW算法，随机环境下O(log T) regret，对抗环境下O(sqrt(T)) regret，并给出与之匹配的下界；扩展到未知转移情形可获得近似最佳的BOBW；还给出面向带聚合反馈的最短路径问题的个体差距相关下界与近似最优解。

Conclusion: 提出面向episodic tabular MDP的首个BOBW框架，证实理论最优性并提供适用于未知转移的扩展策略，同时在最短路径问题上给出重要的下界与算法结果，为后续在复合模型中的BOBW研究奠定基础。

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

### [248] [Matricial Free Energy as a Gaussianizing Regularizer: Enhancing Autoencoders for Gaussian Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17120)
*Rishi Sonthalia,Raj Rao Nadakuditi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于矩阵自由能的新型自编码器正则化方案，通过对代码矩阵的奇异值定义可微损失；最小化负矩阵自由能使代码的奇异值分布接近具有高斯分布的随机度量；实验显示生成的编码近似高斯并且能在训练集和测试集之间泛化；进一步提出一个矩阵自由能最大化的自编码器，可靠地产生高斯编码，并将其应用于欠定逆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过自由概率和随机矩阵理论为自编码器提供稳健的正则化，促使编码分布接近高斯/特定的随机度量分布，从而提升泛化并有利于欠定逆问题的求解。

Method: 在编码矩阵（编码维度 x batch）的奇异值上定义可微的损失函数，基于自由概率、随机矩阵理论，推导当奇异值分布与一个定制的高斯随机度量一致时损失达到最小。通过标准随机梯度下降训练最小化负矩阵自由能来获得高斯样的编码；在此基础上提出一个矩阵自由能最大化的自编码器，以更稳定地产生高斯编码。

Result: 数值仿真表明最小化负矩阵自由能得到的编码近似高斯分布，且对训练集与测试集具有良好泛化性。所提出的矩阵自由能最大化自编码器也能可靠地产生高斯编码，并展示了在欠定逆问题中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 将自由能视角引入自编码器正则化，可以系统性地引导编码分布朝预定的高斯/随机度量分布演化，为处理欠定逆问题提供一类新的编码策略。

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

*Enhao Gu,Haolin Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出零成本自引导（In-situ Autoguidance）的方法，通过模型内部自我纠错实现无辅助模型的引导，降低成本且维持或提升图像质量、多样性和对提示的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 CFG 在提升质量和对齐的同时降低多样性的问题，以及依赖外部辅助模型来解耦这两者的局限。

Method: 在推理阶段通过一次随机前向传播生成一个次优预测，并将其用作引导信号，将引导视为推理时的自我纠错。无需额外模型，实现自给自足的引导。

Result: 零成本引导在实验中可行，成为成本高效引导的新基线，能够在不使用外部模型的情况下保留或提升自引导带来的好处。

Conclusion: 该方法证实自引导的效用并拓展了无需外部模型的可能性，展示了自我纠错作为引导的一种有效范式。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

*Derda Kaymak,Gyuhak Kim,Tomoya Kaichi,Tatsuya Konishi,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 PLDA 框架，用于部署后模型的动态 OOD 检测与新类别增量学习，解决在开放环境中持续学习、类别扩展与数据稀缺问题，避免重新从头训练；通过实证评估来验证效果（文中为未来性陈述，尚未给出具体结果）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放、动态的应用环境中，部署后的模型可能遇到未见类别的样本，需要能检测新样本并在被标注后学习；此过程应尽量无人工干预地进行增量更新，且新类别的引入会扩展原有的 ID 类别集合；传统的 OOD 设定假设 ID 固定、且需要离线重新训练，难以应对数据稀缺的场景，因此需要一个能够在部署后持续学习的框架。

Method: 提出 PLDA（Dynamic Dynamic Learning?）框架，用于在应用运行中进行动态的 OOD 检测和对新类别的增量学习。该方法在观测到未知样本并获得标注后，能立即将新类别加入并更新模型，而无需从头重训练；同时应对数据稀缺问题，确保在资源与时间约束下的增量学习。

Result: 本文给出的是对 PLDA 效用的实证评估计划，拟通过实验验证其在动态 OOD 检测、增量学习新类别以及数据稀缺条件下的有效性。

Conclusion: ALMD（部署后自主学习）范式能够解决固定模型在开放环境中的局限，PLDA 提供了在保持资源效率的同时实现动态 OOD 检测与增量学习的可行路径。未来工作可能集中于算法细化、效率提升、鲁棒性评估及在真实场景中的广泛测试。

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架评估文本属性图学习的鲁棒性，系统比较GNN、RGNN、GraphLLMs在文本、结构和混合扰动下的表现，发现文本与结构鲁棒性存在权衡、对文本编码器和攻击类型高度敏感，GraphLLMs对训练数据污染最脆弱，并提出SFT-auto以在单模型中实现更平衡的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于TAG鲁棒性的研究零散且缺乏系统比较，难以理解文本扰动与结构扰动在不同模型和攻击场景中的影响，需要一个统一的评估框架。

Method: 建立一个统一评估框架，对10个数据集、4个领域、在文本、结构及混合扰动、以及污染和对抗场景下，比较经典GNN、鲁棒GNN（RGNN）以及GraphLLMs的鲁棒性；并提出SFT-auto以在单模型中实现文本与结构鲁棒性的平衡提升。

Result: 分析揭示三点结论：1) 文本与结构鲁棒性之间存在固有的权衡；2) GNNs与RGNNs的鲁棒性和性能高度依赖文本编码器的选择及攻击类型；3) GraphLLMs对训练数据污染尤为敏感。为解决这些权衡，提出SFT-auto，在单模型中实现对文本与结构扰动的更强鲁棒性与平衡性。

Conclusion: 为TAG安全研究提供系统性基线，揭示不同模型在文本与结构扰动下的鲁棒性特性，并给出实用的缓解方案（如SFT-auto），代码已开源以促进复现与进一步研究。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 MD 方法的评估缺乏统一、可重复的基准，评估指标不一致、对稀有构象的采样不足，难以实现跨方法的客观比较。需要一个开放、模块化的基准平台来标准化评估流程。

Result: 框架实现了跨 MD 方法的快速、可重复的构型采样评估，提供了丰富的评估指标与数据集，证明在统一评估协议下不同方法的可比性，并展示了对 CGSchNet 等机器学习模型的效能对比。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估协议，建立开放源代码基准平台，推动分子模拟社区在方法学比较上的严格性和可重复性，促进对新方法（包括 AI/ML 驱动的势能与采样技术）的公正评估与广泛采用。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

### [253] [SOLE: Hardware-Software Co-design of Softmax and LayerNorm for Efficient Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17189)
*Wenxun Wang,Shuchang Zhou,Wenyu Sun,Peiqin Sun,Yongpan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE is a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and LayerNorm (SOLE) achieving low-precision Softmax and LayerNorm through E2Softmax (log2-exponent quantization and log-based division) and AILayerNorm (low-precision statistics). It enables retraining-free, real-time transformer inference with substantial speedups and energy/area efficiency over GPUs and prior hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from slow real-time inference due to Softmax and LayerNorm inefficiencies, high memory overhead, and reliance on retraining for approximation errors. A co-designed solution aims to reduce computation and memory while preserving accuracy.

Method: Propose E2Softmax (log2-exponent quantization and log-based division) and AILayerNorm (low-precision statistics) as a hardware-software co-design, enabling low-precision implementations for Softmax and LayerNorm without retraining.

Result: Experiments show maintained accuracy without retraining, with 3.04x and 3.86x energy-efficiency improvements, and 2.82x and 3.32x area-efficiency improvements over GPU and prior state-of-the-art hardware, respectively.

Conclusion: SOLE offers a practical, retraining-free approach to accelerate transformer inference by co-designing Softmax and LayerNorm with quantization-based approximations, achieving significant speed and energy/area benefits.

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

Conclusion: 通过引入多模态性建模、风险意识与双评估器，共同提升 HRHR 场景下的鲁棒性与性能，所提框架具有良好的可扩展性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

*Jiayu Bai,Zhanbo Feng,Zhijie Deng,Tianqi Hou,Robert C. Qiu,Zenan Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADCMs 自动自适应离散化框架，基于局部一致性目标和全局一致性约束，利用高斯牛顿法实现离散步长的自适应调节，用于改进一致性模型的训练效率和生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一致性模型多依赖手工设计的离散化策略，需对不同噪声调度和数据集反复调整，影响训练效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 将离散化步长作为优化变量，通过在训练过程中将局部一致性设为优化目标以保持可训练性、将全局一致性设为约束以控制训练目标中的去噪误差，并用拉格朗日乘子建立局部/全局之间的权衡；基于高斯-牛顿法实现自适应离散化；命名 ADCMs。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 与 ImageNet 上显著提高训练效率并获得更优的生成性能，且对更先进的扩散模型变体具有良好适应性，代码可在 GitHub 找到：https://github.com/rainstonee/ADCM

Conclusion: ADCMs 为一致性模型提供一个统一且自适应的离散化框架，提升训练效率与鲁棒性，并具备扩展性。

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

TL;DR: 在数据同化中提出一个基于变分推断的扩展，将预测状态建模为多元高斯分布，并在Lorenz-96上实现近乎完美校准的预测，可集成到更广的变分数据同化流程中并受益于更长的观测窗口；代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据同化中的不确定性普遍存在，且现有方法对预测分布的可信度不足。通过引入概率建模和变分推断，提升预测的校准性。

Method: 在现有确定性机器学习数据同化框架的基础上，提出一个变分推断扩展，使预测状态服从多元高斯分布，并与变分数据同化流程耦合。

Result: 在洛伦兹-96系统上实现近乎完全校准的预测；随着数据同化窗口长度的增加，整体性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供可靠的不确定性估计并可在广义变分数据同化框架中部署，且开源实现便于复现。

Abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model with a
set of noisy and incomplete observations in order to infer the state of a
system over time, involves uncertainty in most settings. Building upon an
existing deterministic machine learning approach, we propose a variational
inference-based extension in which the predicted state follows a multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing
ground, we show that our new model enables to obtain nearly perfectly
calibrated predictions, and can be integrated in a wider variational data
assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater benefit from increasing
lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available at

### [257] [Breaking and Fixing Defenses Against Control-Flow Hijacking in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17276)
*Rishi Jha,Harold Triedman,Justin Wagle,Vitaly Shmatikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出并实现 ControlValve，基于允许的控制流图和上下文规则，防御多智能体系统中的控制流劫持攻击，弥补现有对齐检查的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中存在控制流劫持攻击，其通过操纵智能体之间的调用与协作来执行不安全操作并窃取敏感信息。现有防御（如 LlamaFirewall）依赖对齐检查以确保调用“相关且可能促进”原目标，但对齐定义脆弱且执行上下文不可见，导致安全性与功能性目标存在根本冲突，攻击可在对齐条件下逃逸。

Method: 分析并挑战基于对齐检查的防御在现实中的局限，提出 ControlValve。ControlValve 基于控制流完整性（CFI）与最小权限原则：1) 生成多智能体系统的被许可控制流图；2) 强制所有执行符合这些图及为每个智能体调用零样本生成的上下文规则。实现、部署与对比评估。

Result: 实现并评估 ControlValve；论文声称该框架能够生成并执行被许可的控制流，以及针对每个调用的上下文规则，从而约束多智能体系统的执行路径，防护潜在的控制流劫持。

Conclusion: ControlValve 提供了一种基于控制流完整性和最小权限的新防御范式，用以缓解对齐检查的局限性并协调安全性与功能性的需求。但对齐定义的脆弱性与执行上下文的可见性问题仍是挑战，零样本生成的上下文规则的鲁棒性是其关键依赖。

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

### [258] [Symmetries in PAC-Bayesian Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17303)
*Armin Beck,Peter Ochs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展了PAC-Bayes泛化界限至非紧对称性（如平移）及非不变量数据分布，提供理论保证并在旋转MNIST数据集上验证，表明对称性模型在更广范围的场景下也有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性已知能提升模型，但现有理论主要针对紧对称群和数据分布不变的假设，现实数据往往不满足。

Method: 在PAC-Bayes框架基础上对现有边界进行改编与收紧，选择McAllester的边界为核心，并展示其可适用于多种PAC-Bayes边界；将非紧对称性和非不变量分布纳入分析，同时给出推导和界限。

Result: 通过在带非均匀旋转群的旋转MNIST上实验，理论界限成立且对比先前结果有改进；给出对于对称数据，对称模型优于仅在紧对称群/不变分布假设下的结论。

Conclusion: 为对称性在机器学习中的理解提供更广泛的理论证据，促成对非紧对称性与非不变量分布场景下的泛化分析；提出未来在更广范围的对称性和分布设定下的扩展方向。

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个跨六数据集的多因子序列解嵌入基准，覆盖视频、音频与时间序列，并附带模块化数据集集成、模型开发与评估工具。提出后验潜在变量探索阶段以自动对齐潜变量与语义因子，及一个 Koopman 启发的模型实现最先进结果。同时展示 Vision-Language Models 可自动标注数据并作为零样本解 disentanglement 评估者，减少人力标签需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时序数据往往包含多种相互交互的语义因素，且具有动态变化的属性。现有工作多聚焦于静态/动态两因子情形，数据获取和评估也受限，难以系统研究多因子序列解嵌。需一个统一、可扩展的基准来推动该领域的发展。

Method: 构建六个覆盖视频、音频、时间序列的多因子序列数据集；提供模块化工具以便数据集接入、模型开发和评估指标的定制化；提出后验潜在变量探索阶段（Post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage）以自动对齐潜变量与语义因素；引入受 Koopman 理论启发的模型以提升因子解耦性能；并利用 Vision-Language Models 自动标注数据与进行零-shot的解嵌评估。

Result: 在新的多因子序列基准上实现了最先进的解嵌性能，且证明了 Vision-Language Models 能实现自动数据标注与零-shot 解嵠评估，减少对人工标签的依赖；整体方案表现出良好的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 为多因子序列解嵌提供一个稳健、可扩展的研究基线与评估框架，促进跨模态与跨任务的统一评估及后续的方法改进。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

*Lipeng Xie,Sen Huang,Zhuo Zhang,Anni Zou,Yunpeng Zhai,Dingchao Ren,Kezun Zhang,Haoyuan Hu,Boyin Liu,Haoran Chen,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种训练-free、数据高效的奖励建模框架，通过 Propose-Evaluate-Revise 推断查询特定的高质量评语表，并通过最大化信息论编码率将其压缩为核心非冗余集合，最终形成层次化的 Theme-Tips 评语表；在仅使用极少量偏好对的情况下，仍能提高小模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型需昂贵的偏好数据且可解释性不足；基于评语表的方法在可扩展性与可靠性之间存在权衡；需要一种可解释、数据高效且可扩展的奖励建模路径。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过验证引导的 Propose-Evaluate-Revise 过程，推断出高质量、按查询定制的评语表；第二阶段在信息论编码率的驱动下将这些细粒度评语概括为一个紧凑、无冗余的核心集合，形成层次化的 Theme-Tips 评语集。

Result: 大量实验显示该框架具备卓越的数据效率和性能。仅使用70对偏好对（约源数据的1.5%），就能使较小的 Qwen3-8B 等模型超越专门训练的对手。

Conclusion: 这项工作为奖励建模提供了一个可扩展、可解释且数据高效的新路径，显著降低了对大规模标注数据的依赖，同时提升了中小模型的竞争力。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

### [261] [Localist LLMs with Recruitment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17358)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations from localist to distributed, featuring a locality dial, adaptive information-theoretic recruitment, and hierarchical recruitment across specialized LLMs, supported by group sparsity, anchors, dynamic rule injection, and penalized likelihood with units; with explicit threshold results, entropy/pointer bounds, and convergence guarantees to balance interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge interpretability and scalability in LLMs by enabling dynamic, multi-granularity capacity allocation without retraining, while allowing operation in regulated domains that require transparency.

Method: Introduce a locality dial to control localization during training/inference without retraining; develop an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that allocates semantic blocks as needed without full domain knowledge at initialization; implement a hierarchical recruitment framework to allocate capacity across multiple specialized LLMs. Techniques include group sparsity penalties on attention, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and penalized likelihood with explicit units. Provide mathematical results giving explicit threshold conditions for attention concentration, entropy and pointer fidelity bounds, and convergence guarantees at block and LLM levels."

Result: The paper delivers rigorous mathematical results establishing threshold conditions under which attention concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. It also proves convergence of the hierarchical recruitment mechanism at both the block level (within-LLM) and the LLM level (across domains), ensuring discovery of semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency, enabling interpolation between interpretable and high-performance modes and multi-granularity capacity allocation.

Conclusion: The framework enables continuous interpolation between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

TL;DR: 通过 metamers 生成在 GNN 内部激活相同但输入结构不同的图，揭示极端表示不变性并提供新的基准来评估模型的鲁棒性和人类级不变性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解答为何GNN在表示不变性方面与人类差距显著并缺乏系统评估工具，借鉴视觉/听觉领域的不变性研究，构建对比分析框架。

Method: 提出 metamers 生成方法：通过优化输入图，使目标模型中参考图的内部节点激活尽量相似；对局部 metamer dimension 与 metamers 流形体积变化进行理论分析；在多种经典 GNN 架构上进行实验以评估不变性强度。

Result: 发现多种经典 GNN 架构呈现极高的表示不变性；对模型结构与训练策略的改动只能部分缓解，无法根本缩小与人类不变性的差距；元图与原图间存在显著的结构和节点特征差异，以及新的失效模式。

Conclusion: metamer 基准为评估 GNN 不变性提供补充工具，揭示当前方法的局限性与新的失败模式，提示需要新的建模范式以实现更接近人类的不变性。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 DISC，通过扩散模型的迭代去噪过程提取多维特征，在检测 OOD 的同时对 OOD 类型进行分类，实现从单一二元检测向更细粒度检测的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 OOD 检测多采用单一标量分数，难以区分不同类型的 OOD 数据，导致在实际决策中缺乏上下文信息。需要能够识别“何种”离分布数据，以便采取更合适的后续行动。

Method: 利用扩散模型的多步去噪过程，提取跨多个噪声水平的统计特征向量，构建一个多维表示，用于 OOD 检测与 OOD 类型分类，可能结合分类头进行类型标签预测。

Result: 在图像与表格数据基准上，DISC 的检测性能与或超过现有 SOTA，同时具备对 OOD 类型进行分类的能力，这是以往工作所未充分实现的能力。

Conclusion: 将 OOD 检测从单一二元判定提升为可区分的、可行动的细粒度检测，为开放式学习与安全性应用提供更丰富的上下文信息。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究现代生成模型内部表示的演变，并批判主流隐含空间等隐喻，借助媒体理论对合成的概念进行再分析。

Method: 对模型架构进行密切解读；通过针对性的层级表示干预，比较 GAN/VAEs 与扩散模型的内部工作方式；运用文本与架构分析的混合方法。

Result: 扩散模型将表征重担分散到各层，未形成一个紧凑的、可统一操作的潜在空间；对“潜在空间”等隐喻提出质疑，强调“广义合成”的层级分布性。

Conclusion: 应当将生成性 AI 的理解从“直接合成内容”转向“专门化过程的耦合配置”的 emergent 性视角，并重新审视潜在空间、Platonic Representation Hypothesis 等隐喻。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

*Pengxiang Cai,Zihao Gao,Jintai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 TabR1，一种用于表格预测的推理型大语言模型，结合 PRPO 的强化学习，提升有限监督下的泛化与可解释性；在零-shot和少量-shot 设置下表现接近或超越强基线，8B 参数版本在多任务上优于更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在解释性和跨表泛化方面受限；现有梯度提升树等模型虽强，但可解释性与跨任务迁移差。希望通过可解释的推理轨迹和跨任务适应性的 LLM，提升表格预测的性能与迁移能力。

Method: 引入 PRPO（Permutation Relative Policy Optimization）：对样本构建多种标签保持的列排列，基于结构先验实现列置换不变性；在同一样本中跨排列估计优势，并将稀疏奖励转化为密集学习信号；在 TabR1 框架中使用多步推理的 LLM 来完成表格预测。

Result: 在有限监督下，提升了少-shot/零-shot的推理性能；全监督微调下与强基线相当；在零-shot情形下接近32-shot基线的表现；8B版本在多项任务上显著优于更大模型（对 DeepSeek-R1 685B 的提升可达约53.17%）。

Conclusion: 证明了在表格预测任务中，通过引入结构化偏好和多步推理的 LLM，能在有限 supervision 下激活推理能力、提升可解释性及跨任务泛化，且小型模型（8B）即可与更大模型竞争。

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 首次给出适用于弱可传导MDP、带函数近似的离线平均奖励强化学习的有限时间样本复杂度结果。提出 Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration，并将锚点视为权重衰减，作为实现理论分析的关键；分析扩展至单轨迹数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线RL样本复杂度研究多聚焦折现回报，且在平均奖励设置上研究有限，且常需严格假设如遍历性或线性MDP。需要在更弱的假设下获得可实现的有限时间理论保障，以提升对实际平均奖励任务的理论理解和实践指导。

Method: 提出 Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration，将标准 FQI 与锚机制结合；锚点类似权重衰减，帮助在平均奖励设定下实现有限时间分析。分析同时覆盖数据来自独立同分布的转移与来自单轨迹序列的情况，利用锚点实现对相关性与偏差的控制。

Result: 首次给出带函数近似的离线平均奖励RL的有限时间样本复杂度结果；锚点是实现分析的关键，使得在平均奖励和弱可传导MDP下的理论收敛与样本复杂度可控。并将上述分析扩展到单轨迹数据集的情形。

Conclusion: 锚点机制是实现平均奖励离线RL有限时间分析的核心工具，为在更宽松的MDP假设下进行带函数近似的离线学习提供了理论支撑，并扩展了数据来源的灵活性。

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID

*Tiezhi Wang,Wilhelm Haverkamp,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 S4ECG，一种基于结构化状态空间模型的多时段 ECG 分类架构，通过联合多历时预测来实现对心律失常的高分辨率识别，显著超越单历时方法，最佳窗口为 10-20 分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在 ECG 时间序列中同时捕捉全局趋势与局部波形特征存在挑战。现有方法往往只能捕捉全局或局部，难以实现高时间分辨率的动态交互分析。本文通过将结构化状态空间模型引入到多历时分析中，旨在提升心律失常（尤其是房颤和房扑）的检测性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出 S4ECG：基于结构化状态空间模型的深度学习架构，用于多历时 ECG 的联合预测；通过对不同时间段的输入进行并行/级联建模，并在输出层实现多历时标签的融合；对比单历时基线，在 10-20 分钟窗口上进行系统评估。

Result: 相比单历时方法，宏平均 AUROC 提升 1.0-11.6%；房颤特异性从 0.718-0.979 提升至 0.967-0.998；在同分布与跨分布场景下均表现出更强鲁棒性。系统性分析表明最优时间依赖窗口为 10-20 分钟。

Conclusion: 将时间序列层次化分析引入心电信号解读，S4ECG 展现出对复杂心律失常（如房颤、房扑）更高的检测性能，推动对 ECG 的时序感知分析的范式转变，并为后续临床应用提供更高的解释性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

*Duo Su,Huyu Wu,Huanran Chen,Yiming Shi,Yuzhu Wang,Xi Ye,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Diffusion As Priors (DAP)，通过 Mercer 核衡量合成数据与真实数据在特征空间的相似性，并将其作为先验引导逆扩散，从而提升蒸馏数据的代表性、泛化与保真度，且无需额外训练即可实现训练-free 框架，在 ImageNet-1K 等数据集上达到优于现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的数据集蒸馏在多样性、泛化和代表性之间难以同时优化，且常需要外部约束或额外训练来提升数据质量，然而扩散模型的 representativeness 偏好未被充分利用。

Method: 将真实数据与合成数据在特征空间中的相似性用 Mercer 核量化，形成一个 representativeness 先验；将该先验作为指引，进入逆扩散过程，促进合成数据的代表性提升；无需对扩散模型再训练，完成一个训练-free 的框架。

Result: 在大规模数据集（如 ImageNet-1K 及子集）上的实验显示，DAP 在生成高保真数据集方面超过了当前最优方法，并且具备更强的跨体系结构泛化能力。理论上建立了 diffusion priors 与数据蒸馏目标之间的联系，提供了一个实用的训练-free 框架来提升蒸馏数据质量。

Conclusion: DAP 将 diffusion priors 与数据蒸馏目标统一起来，给出训练成本低、效果更优的蒸馏数据生成方法，具有良好的理论与实践意义，并可推广到更多数据集蒸馏场景。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossStateECG: 基于跨状态的ECG生物识别模型，结合多尺度卷积特征提取和注意力机制，在休息-运动等跨状态场景下实现高鲁棒性识别，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ECG生物识别大多聚焦于静息状态，休息-运动状态下的识别性能下降尚未解决。需要一个对跨状态变换鲁棒的识别模型，以适应现实中的动态场景。

Method: 将多尺度深度卷积特征提取与注意力机制相结合，构建可在不同生理状态间保持识别性能的模型；在休息 ECGID（exercise-ECGID）数据集上进行跨状态评估（Rest->Exercise、Exercise->Rest），并在 Rest->Rest、Mixed->Mixed 等场景以及 ECG-ID、MIT-BIH 等数据集上进行泛化验证。

Result: 在 exercise-ECGID 数据集上，Rest->Exercise 的识别率为 92.50%，Exercise->Rest 的识别率为 94.72%；Rest->Rest 为 99.94%，Mixed->Mixed 为 97.85%；在 ECG-ID、MIT-BIH 数据集也实现了良好泛化。

Conclusion: CrossStateECG 展现出在跨状态ECG生物识别中的强鲁棒性和泛化能力，具有在动态现实场景下实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the
generalization abilities of CrossStateECG, underscoring its potential as a
practical solution for post-exercise ECG-based authentication in dynamic
real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过随机层次模型（RHM）生成的递归序列，研究 Transformer 的组合推理与跨层泛化。结果显示任务复杂性和上下文示例数量提升性能，且在训练中出现分层专门化的层级表征；PCA 与注意力模式聚类揭示模块化、结构化的内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示 Transformer 如何在未见序列上进行组合推理以及在歌曲中进行技能组合的能力，并理解其内部机制如何随训练发展而形成层次化、可解释的表征。

Method: 使用随机层次模型（RHM）作为概率上下文无关文法，递归地生成序列并对模型进行子集训练；在四种泛化设定下评估：记忆式、同分布泛化、同规则下的分布外泛化以及跨层转移；通过主成分分析（PCA）和注意力模式聚类分析层间专门化与分层表征的出现，并关联于泛化性能。

Result: 行为结果：任务复杂性提升和 in-context 示例数量增加均提高性能；分布外泛化通常需要显著更多的示例才能达到同等水平。机制结果：训练过程中出现层专门化的渐进 emergence，与更好的泛化相关；PCA 与聚类显示变换器形成结构化、分层的专门化表征，表明内部算法性结构与外部能力之间存在联系。

Conclusion: 变换器发展出模块化、可解释的推理机制，能够在面向未知序列时进行组合推理。内部层级化表征的出现将算法结构与Observed行为能力联系起来，提升对模型推理过程的理解。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: I-RAVEN-X extends I-RAVEN to evaluate symbolic, analogical, and mathematical reasoning under higher operand complexity, broader attribute ranges, and perceptual uncertainty, comparing LLMs and LRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大模型在符号推理中的泛化与鲁棒性，特别是在复杂操作、属性扩展和感知不确定性条件下，探讨LRMs相较于LLMs的表现差异与局限性。

Method: 构建 I-RAVEN-X 基准，提升操作数复杂性、属性范围，并引入感知不确定性；在LLMs与LRMs上进行对比实验，衡量生产力、系统性，以及在更长推理关系和更广属性范围上的能力，并分析在不确定性下的推理与多概率结果的探索能力。

Result: LRMs在较长推理关系和更广属性范围上显示出更高的生产力与系统性，但在处理不确定性方面仍显不足，且难以有效探索多种概率性结果。

Conclusion: LRMs在符号推理任务上取得进展，能在部分场景超越LLMs，但对不确定性和概率输出的推理仍需改进，未来工作可聚焦不确定性建模、概率推理策略以及多样化推理路径的探索。

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate
generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X
extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and
introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively
explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

TL;DR: 在小批量下，动量是实现随机 DC 优化收敛的关键；给出带动量的算法在标准光滑性和凹部方差假设下的收敛性证明，并在实验证 performance 上表现良好；相比之下，若无动量即使步长合适也可能发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在小批量条件下，随机差分-凸（DC）优化的收敛性问题，克服需要大批量或强噪声假设的局限性。

Method: 提出基于动量的随机 DC 优化算法，在对凹部的噪声方差有界、并满足标准光滑性假设下，证明对任意批量大小均能收敛，并给出与无动量情形的对比。

Result: 在理论上证明了带动量的算法的收敛性，并给出实证结果，显示更优的性能表现。

Conclusion: 动量对随机 DC 优化在小批量条件下的收敛性是必要且有效的，所提算法不仅具备 provable 收敛性，也在实际应用中展现强劲性能。

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

TL;DR: 将标签空间分割给若干合作玩家，通过好奇心奖励强化对尾部标签的梯度更新，从而提升长尾多标签学习的Rare-F1表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾不平衡导致大头标签主导梯度，忽视稀有但重要标签；需要无需手动调整类别权重的机制来提升对尾部标签的学习。

Method: 将标签空间分配给多个合作玩家，共享全局准确性回报，同时获得以标签稀有度和玩家间分歧为驱动的好奇心奖励；通过梯度的最佳反应更新使潜在函数上升，收敛到对尾部敏感的稳定点。

Result: 在常用基准和三类极端规模数据集上实现显著的状态-of-the-art提升，Rare-F1最高提升约4.3%，P@3提升约1.6%；消融实验显示出现了劳动分工和对罕见类更快达成共识的现象。

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL提供一个原理上清晰、可扩展的框架，提升多标签学习对长尾的鲁棒性，无需手动调参的类别权重。在多标签预测中具有良好的可扩展性与性能表现。

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFKD通过生成多样的反事实样本并进行知识蒸馏，解决没有混淆变量标签时的偏差问题，能在多混淆因素和低数据情境下提升对群体的泛化与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习易被伪相关（Clever Hans）误导；现有的组分布鲁棒方法需要组标签、样本不足、以及当多个混淆因子导致群体进一步碎片化时性能下降。

Method: 利用多样化反事实样本并由人类标注者辅助探索决策边界，然后进行教师模型到学生模型的知识蒸馏，以重加权与扩充undersampled群体且不需要混淆变量标签。

Result: 在五个数据集（从合成到工业应用）上验证，在低数据场景和强伪相关情况下尤为显著提升；对反事实解释器和教师模型的消融表明其对鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: CFKD可扩展到多混淆因素、实现对群体的平衡泛化，相较于依赖组标签的DFR具有更广泛适用性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CAb（Conformal Alignment-based）级联方法，通过将边缘-云计算的升级决策视为多假设检验问题，基于符合性对齐实现对边缘预测的云级条件覆盖的统计保证，并提供可控的风险、覆盖率和集合大小权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘推理中实现低延迟的同时，仍需满足“条件覆盖率”——边缘返回的预测集应在用户设定的概率下包含真实标签，且以云模型的条件分布为参照。现有方法难以在边缘分布和云分布之间提供明确的条件覆盖保证且可控风险。

Method: 将边缘的预测集的条件覆盖定义为相对于云预测分布的条件覆盖；提出CAb级联机制，通过将边缘到云的升级视为多假设检验问题，进行编号策略并对齐（CA）以选择哪些输入可以安全地在边缘处理；该CA方法可对任意边缘预测集合（包括变体的条件预测CP）进行适配，用户可调控风险水平；对平均达到云级条件覆盖的边缘决策比例提供统计保证。

Result: CAb级联在边缘决策中对云级条件覆盖的实现提供统计保证，且可在覆盖率、转发/推迟率和集合大小之间进行可控权衡；在CIFAR-100和TeleQnA基准上实验表明，保持目标条件覆盖的同时显著减少对云端的下推，且边缘预测集合规模有适度增加。

Conclusion: 该工作为边缘-云级联提供了理论上的条件覆盖保证与实际可控参数化权衡，方法可应用于任意边缘预测集合，尤其适合需要云级分布对比的场景，并在实验中得到有效性验证。

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实轨迹受路网功能与POI描述等文本信息影响，旅行目的信息难以高效建模；轨迹数据常包含冗余点，导致计算与嵌入质量下降；需要在保持语义表达的前提下提升效率。

Method: 提出TrajMamba，包含 Traj-Mamba 编码器：同时从GPS与路网视角建模轨迹以捕捉移动模式；旅行目的感知的预训练：在不增加嵌入计算开销的前提下将旅行目的融入嵌入；知识蒸馏预训练：通过可学习的掩码生成器识别关键点并获得高效的压缩轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在两个真实数据集和三个下游任务上，TrajMamba在效率和准确性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TrajMamba为轨迹学习提供一种高效且具有丰富语义表示的框架，能有效减轻冗余与计算负担，并具备良好的迁移到多任务的潜力。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测评估指标覆盖范围有限，往往只反映任务的某一方面，且容易产生误导性结果，缺乏统一且可验证的评估框架来支持理论分析与公平比较。

Method: 定义并形式化一组可验证的属性，构建理论框架用于评估时间序列异常检测；对37种广泛使用的评价指标进行系统分析，发现多数仅满足部分属性且无一同时满足所有属性；提出LARM作为可满足所有属性的灵活度量，并将其扩展为更严格的ALARM版本。

Result: 分析结果显示多数现有指标仅满足极少数属性，且没有指标同时满足全部属性；LARM能够证明性地满足全部属性，ALARM在此基础上提高了对严格要求的满足度。

Conclusion: 提供了一个 principled 的时间序列异常检测评估框架，解释了评估不一致的原因，并给出可验证且可比的度量工具（LARM及ALARM），以支持更可靠的研究与应用。

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

TL;DR: 对安全强化学习中的拉格朗日乘子进行系统性分析，揭示乘子 λ 的高度敏感性、自动更新的潜力与风险，以及通过 PID 控制缓解振荡的可行性与局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要同时优化回报和约束的安全关键领域，拉格朗日方法的乘子选择直接决定权衡效果，但自动更新的鲁棒性和对最终性能的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 在多任务中分析 λ 的性能-约束权衡，绘制 λ-曲线（lambda-profiles），比较固定 λ 与自动更新策略，对自动更新的振荡进行诊断并尝试使用 PID 控制；给出复现代码。

Result: 自动更新能在某些情形下达到甚至超过最优的 λ* 对应的性能，但学习轨迹差异巨大导致结果波动；λ 非常敏感且对 λ* 的直觉不足；存在训练过程中的振荡，可通过 PID 控制缓解，但需要对不同任务进行细致调参。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以稳定化拉格朗日方法在安全 RL 的表现，尽管自动更新显示潜力，但稳定性与可泛化性仍是挑战，未来工作应探讨更鲁棒的调整策略和自适应调参机制；代码可复现。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need

*Ludi Li,Junbin Mao,Hanhe Lin,Xu Tian,Fang-Xiang Wu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEPerFed是一种面向多脉冲MRI的通信高效个性化联邦学习方法。通过引入客户端历史风险梯度和历史均值梯度来协调局部与全局优化，有效缓解数据异质性；并通过层次奇异值分解（HSVD）实现高效通信，仅传输关键信息。经五项分类任务验证，显示出稳定的收敛性与性能提升，代码将在接受后公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保护隐私的前提下，通过联邦学习进行多机构多脉冲MRI分类，但数据分布异质性和大量模型参数导致收敛困难和通信成本高。需要一种能够在异质分布下实现个性化且高效通信的解决方案。

Method: CEPerFed通过引入两类客户端历史梯度：历史风险梯度用于加权来自其他客户端的贡献（提高局部更新的鲁棒性），历史均值梯度用于约束局部更新与全局优化方向的一致性（确保在异质数据上的稳定收敛）。为降低通信开销，提出层次化SVD（HSVD）策略，只传输对模型更新最关键的信息。

Result: 在五项分类任务上实验，CEPerFed表现出有效性，提升了收敛稳定性并降低通信负担。

Conclusion:  CEPerFed通过结合历史梯度信息和HSVD实现了在数据异质性环境中的个性化与通信效率的折中，具备在临床多机构场景中部署的潜力，且代码将于接受后公开。

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

*Jyler Menard,R. A. Mansbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过在抗菌肽设计中对潜在空间进行进一步降维并以物理化学属性进行组织，提升优化效率与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维潜在空间的可解释性不足以及对抗菌肽活性优化的搜索效率低下问题；探索降维、可解释性与物理化学属性对设计的影响。

Method: 使用变分自编码器等深度生成模型来建模序列空间，进一步应用降维技术来压缩设计空间，并以物理化学属性对潜在空间进行组织，评估对抗菌活性优化的影响。

Result: 降维后设计空间在数据可用性较低时更有利，降低的潜在空间更具可解释性；以物理化学属性组织潜在空间在不同标签比例下仍能实现有效的属性约束。

Conclusion: 在有限标签信息下，通过降维和属性导向组织潜在空间可提升优化效率和解释性，为AMP设计提供更可控的搜索空间。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

### [282] [ZACH-ViT: A Zero-Token Vision Transformer with ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation for Robust Lung Ultrasound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17650)
*Athanasios Angelakis,Amne Mousa,Micah L. A. Heldeweg,Laurens A. Biesheuvel,Mark A. Haaksma,Jasper M. Smit,Pieter R. Tuinman,Paul W. G. Elbers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compact Vision Transformer, ZACH-ViT (0.25M params), is permutation-invariant by removing CLS token and positional embeddings and uses ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation to distinguish cardiogenic pulmonary edema from other lung patterns in LUS videos, achieving state-of-the-art ROC-AUC ~0.80 and fast, lightweight inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary edema from non-cardiogenic/normal lungs in lung ultrasound is difficult due to high heterogeneity (NCIP/ARDS-like patterns, interstitial disease, healthy lungs) and overlapping artifacts. Small-data medical imaging benefits from models aligned to data structure rather than merely larger scale.

Method: Introduce ZACH-ViT, a 0.25M-parameter Vision Transformer that is fully permutation-invariant by removing the CLS token and positional embeddings. Apply ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA) that permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving anatomical validity. Evaluated on 380 videos from 95 critically ill patients against nine baselines.

Result: ZACH-ViT achieved validation/test ROC-AUC of 0.80/0.79 with sensitivity 0.60 and specificity 0.91. Other models collapsed to trivial classification. Training speed was 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M params), with 2.5x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Aligning architectural design with the data structure can outperform scale in small-data medical imaging, enabling real-time deployment despite non-cardiogenic heterogeneity.

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

### [283] [Handling Extreme Class Imbalance: Using GANs in Data Augmentation for Suicide Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17661)
*Vaishnavi Visweswaraiah,Tanvi Banerjee,William Romine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dataset with 656 samples (4 positive) uses ML and GAN-based data augmentation to improve suicide prediction; results vary across LR, RF, SVM; GAN aids augmentation; RF had perfect specificity but zero sensitivity; overall approach shows GAN helps for data-scarce suicide prevention modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address extreme class imbalance and scarce positive cases in suicide prediction by augmenting data with GAN-generated samples to train diverse ML models.

Method: Train interpretable and black-box ML models (LR, RF, SVM, etc.) on real data; generate synthetic samples using GAN to augment dataset; evaluate on real test data with metrics: precision, recall, F1, sensitivity, specificity; compare models.

Result: LR: precision 0.99, recall 0.85, F1 0.91; RF: 0.98, 0.99, 0.99; SVM: 0.99, 0.76, 0.86. LR/SVM identified 1 true positive (sensitivity 1.0) and misclassified some non-attempts as attempts (LR: specificity 0.85, SVM: 0.76). RF identified 0 true positives (sensitivity 0) with 0 false positives (specificity 1.0). GAN contributed to data augmentation.

Conclusion: GAN-based augmentation can support suicide prevention modeling; models show strong precision and specificity, but sensitivity varies; combining GAN augmentation with ML can improve detection under data scarcity, though care is needed to avoid missing true attempts.

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

### [284] [Closing the Sim2Real Performance Gap in RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17709)
*Akhil S Anand,Shambhuraj Sawant,Jasper Hoffmann,Dirk Reinhardt,Sebastien Gros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-level RL framework for Sim2Real: inner RL trains policy in simulation; outer RL adjusts simulator parameters and in-sim rewards to maximize real-world policy performance, with theoretical tools and simple validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim2Real gap persists despite more accurate simulators; current proxies like simulator accuracy/variability do not reliably predict real-world policy performance; need direct optimization toward real-world outcomes.

Method: Formulate as bi-level RL: inner level trains policy purely in simulation; outer level adapts the simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world performance of the in-sim policy; derive and validate mathematical tools for such algorithms in simple examples.

Result: Theoretical derivations and demonstration in simple examples indicate that bi-level RL can be developed to close the Sim2Real performance gap; provides foundational tools for this direction.

Conclusion: Proposes a direct, principled approach to optimize simulator parameters based on real-world performance to bridge the Sim2Real gap; highlights potential for new algorithmic development, with future work on scalable bi-level methods and broader validation.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

Motivation: 解决在多模型不确定性环境中实现风险-规避决策的问题，建立策略梯度与动态规划之间的新连接，提供分布不确定性下的最优策略计算框架（包含模型权重自适应更新、指数型风险度量的最优性、以及无模型环境下的Q-learning收敛性证明）。

Method: - 提出坐标上升动态规划（CADP）以对模型权重进行迭代调整，确保对局部最优解的策略单调提升。- 给出指数ERM Bellman算子收缩性的条件，及ERM-TRC/EVaR-TRC的存在性和最优性证明；并推导值迭代、策略迭代、线性规划等算法以计算最优静态策略。- 给出模型无关的Q-learning算法用于ERM-TRC与EVaR-TRC，利用Bellman算子单调性证明收敛性与最优风险值函数。

Conclusion: 本文为在多模型环境中实现风险规避决策提供了系统性理论与算法工具，建立了从DP到策略学习的完整链路，覆盖带权模型不确定性、指数型风险度量的收敛性与存在性，以及无模型强化学习的收敛性保障。

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

*Younghyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将物理信息融入PINN以提升极地海冰预测的可泛化性和物理一致性，优于纯数据驱动模型，特别是在 melting、early freezing 与 fast-moving ice 区域表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动模型在极地海冰条件不断变化、样本分布可能偏移时易产生泛化能力不足与物理不一致性。需要将物理约束融入学习框架以提升鲁棒性。

Method: 在 Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) 架构基础上，加入物理损失函数和特定激活函数，以实现对海冰速度(SIV)和海冰浓度(SIC)的物理一致输出。

Result: 与纯数据驱动模型相比，PINN在日预测SIV与SIC上表现更好，即使训练样本较少也具优势，且对 melting 与 early freezing 期、近快速移动冰区的 SIC 预测有明显改进。

Conclusion: 将物理知识融入深度学习框架可提升极地海冰时空预测的鲁棒性与物理一致性，未来可进一步扩展更多物理约束与多模态数据以增强泛化。

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 1) 分析低基数输出的原因，发现模型倾向生成圆整但信息性强的口头概率；2) 评估常用提示工程、不确定性估计和置信度引导等方法对操作粒度的提升作用，发现其在不牺牲性能与成本的前提下效果有限；3) 提出高效策略显著增加可用操作点的数量和多样性，提升粒度，且在11个数据集与3个LLMs上与基线方法相比具有竞争力或更好表现。

Result: 提出的方法显著增多并多样化可用操作点的数量，且在不牺牲或提升性能的前提下，达到或超过基线方法的表现，覆盖11个数据集和3种LLM。

Conclusion: 通过提升黑盒LLMs作为分类器的操作粒度与可用输出空间，提升适用性与控制能力；该思路在多数据集和多模型上具备良好的一般性和实用性。

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

Conclusion: 可微分 atlas 的方法为直接在潜在流形上建模提供有前景的研究方向，值得进一步探索与扩展到更多应用场景。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: 提出GUM，一种无偏低秩优化方法，基于GaLore与Muon，通过层级采样去偏，保持记忆效率并具备收敛性保证，在LLM微调/预训练中优于GaLore，甚至可超越全参数训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的训练对显存压力巨大；现有低秩投影方法常引入偏差，导致与全参数训练的性能差距无法消除；需要具备理论收敛保证的无偏低秩优化方案。

Method: 在层级上进行采样以实现低秩投影的去偏，将GaLore的机制与Muon算法结合，提出GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM)，给出对等收敛性证明，保持低秩记忆效率。

Result: 理论上GUM与Muon的收敛性保持一致；在LLM的微调和预训练任务上比GaLore有显著改进，甚至优于全参数训练；改进源于层内知识分布更均匀，提高参数空间利用和记忆能力。

Conclusion: 层级采样的去偏低秩优化为内存高效训练提供可观的收敛性保障，GUM在实践中具有应用潜力，并揭示了知识在层间的更均匀分布对学习效果的推动作用。

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理时的计算增益已在大模型和扩散模型中提升样本质量；Flow Matching 在多域受关注，但其推理时的扩展性研究不足；现有方法在推理阶段用非线性VP插值替代线性插值，损失 FM 的高效取样；需提供保持线性插值的推理扩展策略，并探索对非视觉任务的可用性。

Conclusion: 推理时计算扩展为 Flow Matching 提供了有效的性能提升路径，且具有跨域的适用性，能够在视觉和科学领域实现更高质量的无条件生成。

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.
