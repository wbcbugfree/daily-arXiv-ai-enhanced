MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance.

Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias.

Our approach employs multi-source data fusion to enrich merchant categorical fields and a one-word constraint principle for consistent embedding generation across LLM architectures. We systematically address data quality through noise filtering and context-aware enrichment. Experiments on large-scale transaction datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple transaction understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5546\u6237\u5b57\u6bb5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ea4\u6613\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u5d4c\u5165\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5546\u6237\u7c7b\u522b\u5b57\u6bb5\u5e38\u7528\u7d22\u5f15\u5316\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5177\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u5546\u6237\u7c7b\u522b\u5b57\u6bb5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u4e00\u5b57\u7ea6\u675f\u201d\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8LLM\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5904\u7406\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4ea4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u4ea4\u6613\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods. Beyond social choice, SP-Rank supports downstream applications in learning-to-rank, extracting expert knowledge from noisy crowds, and training reward models in preference-based fine-tuning pipelines.

The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a \"table of media-bias elements\". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition.

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eAM-\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5916\u63a8\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u53ca\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u4f53\u5316\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u732e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u673a\u5668\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLMs\u4e0eAM-MKG\u7d27\u5bc6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u672c\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f93\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5916\u63a8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5916\u63a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u63a8\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5b50\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u4e0a\u6bd4\u65e0\u6307\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3001\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLMs\u5728AM\u5916\u63a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "TagRAG\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u56feRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u7b7e\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u94fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u6bd4GraphRAG\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u80dc\u7387\u7ea695.41%\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea614.6\u500d\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea61.9\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u4f9d\u8d56\u788e\u7247\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u53e5\u805a\u7126\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGraphRAG\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTagRAG\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction\uff1a\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u7b7e\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5206\u5c42\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u94fe\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation\uff1a\u68c0\u7d22\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u94fe\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728UltraDomain\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u519c\u4e1a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u53ca\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cTagRAG\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u5747\u80dc\u738795.41%\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u6bd4GraphRAG\u4f4e14.6\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u4f4e1.9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TagRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search.

Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\\mfmd). In this work, we propose \\mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \\mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \\mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hyper-Enz: a knowledge-enhanced hypergraph transformer with KGE to predict enzyme-substrate interactions by modeling chemical reactions as (educt, enzyme, product) triples; achieves substantial gains over traditional models.", "motivation": "Sparse enzyme-substrate databases limit generalization; chemical reaction equations are more accessible and dense, offering richer signals for learning; capturing multi-entity interactions (multiple educts/products) is challenging for conventional models.", "method": "Represent reactions as (educt, enzyme, product) triples in a knowledge graph; apply knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme\u2013substrate pairs; develop Hyper-Enz, a hypergraph transformer that learns representations of hyper-edges involving multiple educts and products; integrate a multi-expert paradigm combining Hyper-Enz with chemical reaction equations to guide learning.", "result": "Significant performance gains: up to 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared with traditional models.", "conclusion": "The proposed knowledge-enhanced hypergraph framework effectively captures complex multi-entity interactions in enzyme prediction, demonstrating the value of integrating hypergraph modeling, KGE, and reaction-based supervision."}}

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints.

However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\u03ba= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker.

We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u751f\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u300211\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u300115\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u56de\u590d\u5185\u4ea7\u751f1000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u8bf7\u6c42\uff081000\u6b21\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u8c03\u7528\uff09\u4e24\u6761\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u4ec5\u670913%\u4e2d\u4f4d\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bf7\u6c42\u51e0\u4e4e\u5168\u90e8\u5931\u8d25\uff0811\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u670910\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\u901a\u8fc7\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u6837\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u968f\u5206\u5e03\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u57dfN\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u6269\u6563\u81f3\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982MCQ\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u6b63\u9010\u6b65\u6210\u4e3a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u6307\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u4fe1\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u7136\u800c\u5176\u539f\u751f\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf911\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\uff0c\u8986\u76d615\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1aBatch Generation\uff08\u5355\u6b21\u56de\u590d\u8f93\u51faN=1000\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0eIndependent Requests\uff08N=1000\u6b21\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b26\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u8fdd\u4f8b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u91c7\u6837 horizon N \u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff08MCQ\u7b54\u6848\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff09", "result": "Batch: \u4e2d\u4f4d\u901a\u8fc7\u738713%\u3002Independent Requests: \u4ec51/11\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u4e00\u5206\u5e03\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u672a\u901a\u8fc7\u3002\u91c7\u6837\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u968f\u5206\u5e03\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14N\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u6076\u5316\u3002\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5f3a\u5236MCQ\u7b54\u6848\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a simplified yet effective framework that leverages prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought task decomposition to guide reasoning within a single large language model. Specifically, our approach decomposes the relevance judgment process into four interpretable subtasks: translation, intent understanding, category matching, and relevance judgment -- and fine-tunes a base model (Qwen2.5-14B) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. This design not only reduces computational and storage overhead but also enhances interpretability by explicitly structuring the model's reasoning path. Experimental results show that our single-model framework achieves competitive accuracy and high inference efficiency, processing 20 samples per second on a single A100 GPU. In the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup Competition Proposals, our method achieved 0.8902 on the public leaderboard and 0.8889 on the private leaderboard, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation.

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u91d1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5224\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u201c\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd8\u662f\u8868\u5c42\u6a21\u4eff\u201d\uff0c\u4ee5MFT\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e24\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684SAE\u63d0\u53d6\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6MFT\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u533a\u5206\u57fa\u91d1\uff1bSAE\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u91d1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u6cbf\u7740\u5bc6\u96c6\u5411\u91cf\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u57fa\u91d1\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8868\u660e\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u5448\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u591a\u5143\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections.

In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks.

However, the increasing volume of user-generated reviews has led to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to identify content that aligns with their specific preferences. Existing review ranking systems typically rely on metrics such as helpfulness votes, star ratings, and recency, but these fail to capture individual user interests and often treat textual sentiment and rating signals separately. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions.

Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14(DSI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728CO2\u50a8\u5b58\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u5e94\u529b\u4e0e\u65ad\u5c42\u6ed1\u52a8\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u751f\u6210\u540e\u9a8c\u5730\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u65ad\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u5404\u573a\u91cf\u53ca\u65ad\u5c42\u6ed1\u52a8\u8d8b\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u62df\u5408\u5728\u8026\u5408\u6d41-\u5730\u5e94\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u65ad\u5c42\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u5730\u751f\u6210\u540e\u9a8c\u5730\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51faDSI\u7ed3\u5408VAE\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u5927\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u540e\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u7ea61000\u4e2a\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b54\u9699-\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u7684\u5730\u7edf\u8ba1\u573a\u4e0e\u5730\u5e94\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u7528GEOS\u8fdb\u884c\u8026\u5408\u6d41-\u5730\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u5377\u79efLSTM\u5c42\u7684VAE\uff0c\u5c06\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u6709\u6548\u6cd5\u5411\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u526a\u5e94\u529b\u573a\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884cDSI\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e95\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u540e\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u65ad\u5c42\u76843D\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cDSI-VAE\u7ed9\u51fa\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u5e94\u529b\u573a\u548c\u65ad\u5c42\u6ed1\u79fb\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5173\u952e\u5730\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u65ad\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DSI-VAE\u6846\u67b6\u5728CO2\u50a8\u5b58\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5730\u57fa-\u5730\u5e94\u529b\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u751f\u6210\u540e\u9a8c\u5730\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u573a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the \"competence paradox\" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651 ground-truth \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u671f\u671b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u671f\u671bF1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u6309 ground-truth \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684 ground truth \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u82e5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5dee\u5f02\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u628a\u968f\u673a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728 Ground truth \u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6/\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u671f\u671b\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7 ground-truth \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4/\u4e13\u5bb6-\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\uff09\u6765\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u5982 80% \u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0b\u4f30\u7b97\u201c\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u8fbe\u201d\u5206\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 ground-truth \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u4e0d\u540c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5c42\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u7eb3\u5165\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u3002"}}

Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{Z}eroth- and \\textbf{F}irst-\\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c1%\u5931\u8bef\u5373\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4eba\u8eab\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u201c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c11\u91cf\u9519\u8bef\u4e5f\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\u201d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u518d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e03\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a Complete Information\u3001Incomplete Information\u3001SOSR\uff08Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning\uff09\u3002Complete Information\u7528ASCII\u5730\u56fe\u53bb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\uff0cIncomplete Information\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0cSOSR\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u81f4\u547d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u4e0eVLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u67901%\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u201c\u7f55\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u201d\u5982\u4f55\u653e\u5927\u4e3a\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728ASCII\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u591a\u9879\u8fbe\u52300%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u706b\u707e\u6f14\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u524d\u5f80\u5371\u9669\u533a\u57df\u800c\u975e\u5b89\u5168\u51fa\u53e3\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684LLMs\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c99%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u4eba\u4eec\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, it remains hampered by two fundamental challenges: (1) a theoretical speedup ceiling dictated by the speed ratio between the draft and target models, and (2) high computational waste and pipeline stall due to mid-sequence token rejections of early errors. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textsc{Double} (Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism). By bridging the gap between SD and PSD, our framework resolves the Retrieval \\emph{Precision-Efficiency Dilemma} through a novel synchronous mechanism. Specifically, we enable the draft model to execute iterative retrieval speculations to break the theoretical speedup limits; to alleviate rejections without rollback, the target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance. \\textsc{Double} is entirely training-free and lossless. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art speedup of $\\textbf{5.3}\\times$ on LLaMA3.3-70B and $\\textbf{2.8}\\times$ on Qwen3-32B, significantly outperforming the advanced method EAGLE-3 that requires extensive model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism\uff08Double\uff09\uff0c\u5728 SD \u4e0e PSD \u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u7a81\u7834\u7406\u8bba\u52a0\u901f\u4e0a\u9650\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u9014\u62d2\u7edd\u9020\u6210\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff1a5.3\u00d7\uff08LLaMA3.3-70B\uff09\u548c 2.8\u00d7\uff08Qwen3-32B\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 EAGLE-3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08SD\u3001PSD\uff09\u5728\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff1a1) \u7406\u8bba\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u53d7\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u9650\u5236\uff1b2) \u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e2d\u65ad\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u505c\u987f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e0\u56de\u6eda\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3002\u63d0\u51fa Retrieval Precision-Efficiency Dilemma \u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 Double \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u642d\u5efa SD \u4e0e PSD \u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u63a8\u6d4b\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u7406\u8bba\u52a0\u901f\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b2) \u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u5a01\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u62d2\u7edd\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u56de\u6eda\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u987b\u989d\u5916\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\uff08lossless\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5728 LLaMA3.3-70B \u4e0a 5.3\u00d7 \u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3001\u5728 Qwen3-32B \u4e0a 2.8\u00d7 \u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 EAGLE-3\u3002", "conclusion": "Double \u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9 SD/PSD \u7684\u6709\u6548 bridger\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 Retrieval Precision-Efficiency Dilemma\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u635f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u9886\u5148\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise.

Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa TARS \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728 MMSU\u3001OBQA \u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230/\u63a5\u8fd1 7B \u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u97f3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u597d\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u81ea Transformer \u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa TARS\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u5c42\u7ea7\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u672c\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5956\u8d4f\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6 MMSU \u4e0e OBQA \u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 7B \u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u97f3 LLM \u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u9886\u5148\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeMa: \u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7684 Mamba \u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406 intra-series \u4e0e inter-series \u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa Mamba-SSD\uff08\u65f6\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u4e0e Mamba-DALA\uff08\u53d8\u53d8\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u4e0e\u65f6\u5ef6\u76f8\u5173\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 SOTA \u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 Transformer \u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21/\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u3002Mamba \u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e MTS \u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u5355\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u5ef6\u8026\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DeMa\uff1a\u5c06 MTS \u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e24\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u91c7\u7528 Mamba-SSD \u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u53d8\u53d8\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u91c7\u7528 Mamba-DALA\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cDeMa \u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DeMa \u6210\u529f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301 Mamba \u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9 MTS \u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite advancements in AES technology, current models often overlook ethically and morally problematic elements within essays, erroneously assigning high scores to essays that may propagate harmful opinions. In this study, we introduce the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark, which includes essays integrating sensitive topics such as racism and gender bias, to test the efficacy of various LLMs in recognizing and scoring harmful content. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs require further enhancement to accurately distinguish between harmful and argumentative essays, and (2) both current AES models and LLMs fail to consider the ethical dimensions of content during scoring. The study underscores the need for developing more robust AES systems that are sensitive to the ethical implications of the content they are scoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Harmful Essay Detection (HED) \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30 AES \u548c LLM \u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6570\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a LLM \u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u533a\u5206\u6709\u5bb3\u4e0e\u8bba\u8bc1\u6027\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u7684 AES \u4e0e LLM \u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u65f6\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u3001\u5e26\u6709\u4f26\u7406\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5e76\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u4f53\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5224\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6d89\u53ca\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u4f5c\u6587\u7684 Harmful Essay Detection \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd LLM \u4e0e AES \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f26\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) LLM \u5728\u533a\u5206\u6709\u5bb3\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u5177argumentative\uff08\u8bba\u8bc1\u6027\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b(2) \u5f53\u524d\u7684 AES \u6a21\u578b\u4e0e LLM \u5747\u672a\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5065\u5168\u7684 AES \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5bf9\u6240\u8bc4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u542b\u4e49\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7eb3\u5165\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528 GSPO \u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684 F1-score\uff0c\u8868\u660e RL \u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u6f5c\u529b\uff0cLLMs \u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7535\u5546\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9690\u533f\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8fd0\u8f93\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4ea7\u54c1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u8ba2\u5355\u5386\u53f2\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684 F1-score \u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5546\u4ea4\u6613\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 RL \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship. Our work demonstrates how cutting-edge AI tools can profoundly reshape scholarly workflows and open new avenues for multidisciplinary research in the age of digital manuscripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "A fast, scalable AI pipeline for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts; three-stage pipeline; applied to millions of pages; yields 200k illustrations; very fast per-page processing; enhances visual scholarship.", "motivation": "Address the challenge of large-scale visual analysis of illustrations in historical manuscripts; digital archives exist but manual study is infeasible at scale.", "method": "Three-stage pipeline: (1) fine-tuned image classifier to remove text-only pages; (2) efficient object detector to locate and crop illustrations; (3) multimodal image captioning to generate concise descriptions; results stored in a searchable database; applied to Vatican Library-type collections; scale to >3 million pages; speed ~0.06 s/page.", "result": "Automatically identified and extracted >200,000 unique illustrations across >3 million pages; improved throughput over traditional segmentation techniques; enabled keyword-based retrieval of visual content.", "conclusion": "Demonstrates AI-enabled large-scale visual research in historical manuscripts; benefits art history, cultural heritage, and historical studies; enables analysis of motifs, styles, cross-cultural influences; establishes workflow for multidisciplinary research; potential for broader adoption and datasets."}}

By seamlessly updating a system's memory with both emotional and essential data, our approach promotes deeper empathy and enhances the system's ability to respond meaningfully in open-domain conversations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa KEEM \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e76\u5b58\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7d2f\u79ef\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u4fe1\u606f\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7528\u6237\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8981\u70b9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f/\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u6846\u67b6 KEEM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53c8\u878d\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u8981\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u58f0\u79f0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4fc3\u6210\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u4e0e\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u539f\u6587\u6458\u8981\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "KEEM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8981\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u5171\u540c\u7eb3\u5165\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ULTR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u6e90\u70b9\u51fb\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528 doubly robust \u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u4e25\u91cd\u6c61\u67d3\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u73b0\u6709ULTR\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u503e\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5ea6\u91cf\u6b8b\u7559\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u7ed9\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6216\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u70b9\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u6cc4\u9732\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u52a0\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u6b21\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08doubly robust estimator\uff09\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4efb\u504f\u5dee\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06ULTR\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SCM+\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u504f\u5dee\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Preprint; work in progress", "summary": "Modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle with a fundamental architectural tension: vector indices are optimized for query latency but poorly handle continuous knowledge updates, while data lakes excel at versioning but introduce query latency penalties. We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices). The approach enables production RAG deployments requiring simultaneous optimization for query performance, update efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression.

Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as \"Reasoning + X\", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification.

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task.

The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator.

While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential.

To address these challenges, we propose the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}ontext \\textbf{R}efactoring \\textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive Context Refactoring (ACR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u6784\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u63a7\u5e76\u91cd\u5851\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4etoken\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u8de8\u8f6e\u6b21\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u7740\u4e92\u52a8\u589e\u591a\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u5728\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u6784\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5e93\uff08context refactoring operators\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u63a7\u5e76\u91cd\u5851\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f55\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cACR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4etoken\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "ACR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8token\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens.

Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup. We run a suite of experiments on ranking tasks derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ESCI (Reddy et al., arXiv:2206.06588). Two variants of SToICaL successfully suppress the probability of invalid docID generations and improve on common ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u6392\u5e8f\uff08pointwise generative ranking\uff09\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u4ee4\u724c-\u9879\u76ee\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\uff08SToICaL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a-token docID\u5b9e\u73b0\u6392\u5e8f\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u8d85\u8d8a\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u6548docID\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728WordNet/ESCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u9876-1\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668/\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ecd\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5bf9\u9879\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6587\u6863ID\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a-token docID\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSToICaL\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4ee4\u724c-\u9879\u76ee\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u9879\u7ea7\u4e0e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u5bf9WordNet\u548cESCI\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cdSToICaL\u53d8\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u6548docID\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ec5\u9876-1\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6392\u540d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SToICaL\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u53ca\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0e\u9879\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4e0b\uff0c\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $\u03b5> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples.

The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yor\u00f9b\u00e1), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences.

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction.

In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors.

In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit \"OR\" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit \"AND\" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks.

However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165 HOL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 LogiKEy \u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5f62\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u90e8\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u8bc1\u660e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u9886\u57df\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 LogiKEy \u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91 HOL\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u90e8\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u7406\u5bf9\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684 NLI \u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89e3\u91ca refinement\u3001\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u8bc1\u660e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c deontic \u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8981\u7d20\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e0e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7c7b\u3001\u53ef\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u903b\u8f91\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian.

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity.

We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa PII-VisBench \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5728 online presence \u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5bf9 200 \u540d\u4e3b\u4f53\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8/\u4e2d/\u4f4e/\u96f6\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30 18 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90 VLM\uff0c\u5728 4000 \u4e2a\u63a2\u9488\u4e0a\u8861\u91cf\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u6027 PII \u62ab\u9732\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e3b\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u62ab\u9732 PII\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u6539\u8ff0\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff08\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff09\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5728\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0cPII \u7684\u66b4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9 VLM \u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b 4000 \u4e2a\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u57fa\u51c6 PII-VisBench\uff1b\u5c06 200 \u540d\u4e3b\u4f53\u6309\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u516c\u5f00\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8/\u4e2d/\u4f4e/\u96f6\u56db\u4e2a\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002\u5bf9 18 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90 VLM\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21 0.3B\u201332B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff08Refusal Rate\uff09\u4e0e\u5728\u975e\u62d2\u7edd\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u542b PII \u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff08Conditional PII Disclosure Rate\uff09\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001PII\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8ff0\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4e3b\u4f53\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u3001PII \u62ab\u9732\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u6027 9.10% \u4e0b\u964d\u5230\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027 5.34%\uff09\u3002\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e3b\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u62ab\u9732 PII\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e PII \u7c7b\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6539\u8ff0\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7eb3\u5165 VLM \u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9 PII \u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u7c07\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u697c\u5c42\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001RSSI\u6ce2\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c07\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u6309\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u65e0\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c07\uff0c\u5206\u7c07\u5c42\u7ea7\u53ef\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u5c42\u7ea7\u6216\u697c\u5c42\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u7684\u7c07\u5206\u914d\u6765\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u6307\u7eb9\u6307\u6d3e\u5230\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7c07\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u7c07\u5185\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u82e5\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7b51\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u697c\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data.

However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "StackPlanner\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u3001\u5e26\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u590d\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5229\u7528\u534f\u540c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStackPlanner\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a7\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0cStackPlanner\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAE \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5927\u591a\u6e90\u81ea\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173token\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u8bf1\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9020\u5047\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b26\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0 steering \u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u51fa\u53d1\u70b9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u679c\u6027 token \u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684 falsification \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd420\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u5c42\u6570\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173 token \u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89e6\u53d1\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u7528LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9020\u5047\u751f\u6210\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165/\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9token\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u6781\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\uff1a\u5411\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173token\u5373\u53ef\u5f15\u53d159%-94%\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u88ab\u7b80\u5355token\u89e6\u53d1\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0cLLM-guided falsification \u4e00\u81f4\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u4e0d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u6ee1\u8db3\u201c\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08steering\uff09\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684 SAE \u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection.

To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance.

In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science.

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAutoMonitor-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u9519\u884c\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d63010\u4e2a\u5e26\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u3001\u4e24\u9879\u6307\u6807MR\u4e0eFAR\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u7b54/\u4ee3\u7801/\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684 misses \u4e0e\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u6027-\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u914d\u5bf9\u7684misbehavior\u4e0ebenign\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08\u51713010\u6761\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u752812\u4e2a\u4e13\u6709LLMs\u548c10\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u8bc4\u4f30\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Miss Rate\uff08MR\uff09\u4e0eFalse Alarm Rate\uff08FAR\uff09\u4e24\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u518d\u6784\u5efa153,581\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u5bf9Qwen3-4B-Instruction\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u6613\u6784\u9020\u9519\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u9690\u6027\u9519\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cMR\u4e0eFAR\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u9519\u884c\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4ece\u5934\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u6bb5\u811a\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57\uff08\u6c49\u8bed\u3001\u65e5\u8bed\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u635f\u5931\u4f46\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u5b50\u8bcd\u91cd\u53e0\u672a\u5f15\u53d1\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6bb5\u811a\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u62c9\u4e01\u811a\u672c\u5230\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u975e\u62c9\u4e01\u811a\u672c\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u6216\u540c\u65cf\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u811a\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u662f\u5426\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5e72\u6270\u6709\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u79cd\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4ece\u5934\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u4e0e\u539f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5934\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u539f\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u8bed\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed(mLM)\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff08fertility\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u811a\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e morphosyllabic \u811a\u672c\uff08\u6c49\u8bed\u3001\u65e5\u8bed\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u5927\u5b50\u8bcd\u91cd\u53e0\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6bb5\u811a\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff08fertility\uff09\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5206\u6bb5\u811a\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5bf9\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u62101,500\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66FITD\u539f\u7406\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8d8a\u72f1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aGPT\u5bb6\u65cf\u8106\u5f31\u3001Gemini 2.5 Flash\u8fd1\u4e4e\u514d\u75ab\u3001Claude 3 Haiku\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u62b5\u6297\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66-grounded\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5bf9LLMs\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8eFoot-in-the-Door\u7b49\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u62101,500\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\u975e\u6cd5/\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u4e09\u5927LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u65e0\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1aGPT\u5bb6\u65cfASR\u968f\u5386\u53f2\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u589e\u5e45\u8fbe32\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bGemini 2.5 Flash\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6297\u6027\uff1bClaude 3 Haiku\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u7a81\u7834\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u53d9\u4e8b\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6295\u7968\u3001\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u7684\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u6d45\u5c42\u9012\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u800c\u8a00\u5e76\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30ARC Prize TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u8fa8\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u9879\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1a1) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b2) puzzle-id\u6d88\u878d\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b3) \u9012\u5f52\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6548\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728 canonical \u4e0e heavy augmentation\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0eNaive QLoRA\u5bf9Llama 3 8B\u5728canonical ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1000\u6837\u672c\u6295\u7968\u6bd4\u5355-pass\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u66ff\u6362\u6b63\u786e\u7684Puzzle ID\u4e3a\u7a7a\u767d\u6216\u968f\u673a\u4ee4\u724c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u9012\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9012\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff1bheavy augmentation\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1bTRM\u5728canonical ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f53\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases.

However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions.

We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits.

Code and reproduction materials available on GitHub", "summary": "Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9 Transformer \u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u6587\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5728\u591a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65cf\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c Transformer \u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5212\u5206\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u76f8\u52a0\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u540e\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528 AG News\u3001IMDB\u3001ArXiv \u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u77ed\u5230\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65cf\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff1b\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff1b\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u5347\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b\u8be5\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65cf\u95f4\u5177\u5907\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u9ed8\u8ba4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217 Transformer \u4e2d\u9700\u8ba4\u771f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6DSTS\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfML\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u51dd\u89c6\u70b9\u548c\u77ed\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0cTransformer\u7b49\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u533a\u5206ASD\u4e0eTD\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6DSTS\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0ASD/TD\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDSTS\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u77ed\u65f6\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9ASD\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5e2e\u52a9\u6709\u9650\uff0cDSTS\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments.

While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets.

The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration.

This article examines these recently-proposed quality measurement methods and will discuss their suitability for measuring the quality of authentic interpreting practice, whether delivered by humans or machines, concluding that automatic metrics as currently proposed cannot take into account the communicative context and thus are not viable measures of the quality of any interpreting provision when used on their own. Across all attempts to measure or even categorise quality in Interpreting Studies, the contexts in which interpreting takes place have become fundamental to the final analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u53e3\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u4ea4\u9645\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e0d\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53e3\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fdc\u7a0b\u53e3\u8bd1\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u53e3\u8bd1\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u53e3\u6f14\u5f0f\u53e3\u8bd1\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53e3\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u6c9f\u901a\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd1\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8861\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u53e3\u8bd1\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u673a\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5bf9\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u5728\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u4efb\u4f55\u53e3\u8bd1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53e3\u8bd1\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8bed\u5883\u7eb3\u5165\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53e3\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u5c06\u60c5\u5883\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u8bed\u5883\u7eb3\u5165\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5426\u5b9a\u5355\u4e00\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u9069\u7528\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5206\u7ec4\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684PAC\u5ba1\u6838\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165 SP \u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 EPO \u9884\u6d4b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u968f\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u54ea\u4e9b\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) \u53e3\u888b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u901a\u7528 PAC \u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 SP \u7ef4\u5ea6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7528\u6700\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e SP \u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u5ba1\u8ba1\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0cSP \u7ef4\u5ea6\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u91cf\u5ea6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training.

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor.

We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts.

Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift.

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance.

Diagnosing LLM Truthfulness via Neighborhood Consistency", "comment": "Work in progress", "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100,000-hour corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs. These results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pantagruel \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u7f6e\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u6cd5\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u5728\u6cd5\u8bed\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cd5\u8bed\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u975e\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u7b26\u53f7/\u5355\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6cd5\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\uff08Wikipedia\u3001OSCAR\u3001CroissantLLM\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u6599\uff08MultilingualLibriSpeech\u3001LeBenchmark\u3001INA-100k\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1bINA-100k \u4e3a\u5168\u65b0 10\u4e07\u5c0f\u65f6\u6cd5\u8bed\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u6599\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e3b\u7ebf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08CamemBERT\u3001FlauBERT\u3001LeBenchmark2.0\uff09\u663e\u793a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4e14\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6587\u672c/\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u6cd5\u8bed\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Pantagruel \u4e3a\u6cd5\u8bed\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8de8\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Previous approaches suffer from a severe Execution Bottleneck, as hypothesis evaluation relies strictly on expensive physical execution. To bypass these physical constraints, we internalize execution priors to substitute costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning, drawing inspiration from World Models. In this work, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities when primed with a Verified Data Analysis Report, achieving 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. Finally, we instantiate this framework in FOREAGENT, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop, achieving a 6x acceleration in convergence while surpassing execution-based baselines by +6%.

To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5206\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u6bd4\u55bb\u7684Long CoT\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7531\u4e09\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u6709\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5feb\u901f\u71b5\u6536\u655b\u7684\u952e\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9aLong CoT\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u4f20\u9012\u56feMole-Syn\u5408\u6210\u6709\u6548Long CoT\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eRL\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55LLMs\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u6a21\u4eff\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u94fe\u8def\u63a8\u7406\uff08Long CoT\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u84b8\u998f\u5f97\u5230\u7684Long CoT\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff08\u5171\u4ef7\u6837\u7684Deep-Reasoning\u3001\u6c22\u952e\u6837\u7684Self-Reflection\u3001\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u6837\u7684Self-Exploration\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\uff08Effective Semantic Isomers\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4f20\u9012\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5Mole-Syn\u6765\u5408\u6210\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5feb\u901f\u71b5\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u7ade\u4e89\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6e90\u81eaLong CoT\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6a21\u4eff\uff1b\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5feb\u901f\u71b5\u6536\u655b\u7684\u952e\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ade\u4e89\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff1bMole-Syn\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347Long CoT\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684Long CoT\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Long CoT\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684Mole-Syn\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.
