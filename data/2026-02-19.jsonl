The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces."}

While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models."}

In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty."}

Recently, large language model (LLM)-based recommendation models have demonstrated impressive performance by leveraging LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge. However, adopting LLM-based recommendation models in Federated CDR scenarios introduces new challenges. First, there exists a risk of overfitting with domain-specific local adapters. The magnitudes of locally optimized parameter updates often vary across domains, causing biased aggregation and overfitting toward domain-specific distributions. Second, unlike traditional recommendation models (e.g., collaborative filtering, bipartite graph-based methods) that learn explicit and comparable user/item representations, LLMs encode knowledge implicitly through autoregressive text generation training. This poses additional challenges for effectively measuring the cross-domain similarities under heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based framework for federated cross-domain recommendation, FeDecider. Specifically, FeDecider tackles the challenge of scale-specific noise by disentangling each client's low-rank updates and sharing only their directional components. To handle the need for flexible and effective integration, each client further learns personalized weights that achieve the data-aware integration of updates from other domains. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed FeDecider."}

However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers."}

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%.

In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods.

We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks."}

This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\\textbf{Ta}$ble $\\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models.

We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \\leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables.

To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage.

While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future."}

A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation.

Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature.

Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data."}

The systemic effects of these loops remain poorly understood, in part due to unrealistic assumptions in existing simulation studies. We propose a feedback-loop model that captures implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic adoption of recommendations, and heterogeneous recommender systems. We apply the framework on online retail and music streaming data and analyze systemic effects of the feedback loop. We find that increasing recommender adoption may lead to a progressive diversification of individual consumption, while collective demand is redistributed in model- and domain-dependent ways, often amplifying popularity concentration. Temporal analyses further reveal that apparent increases in individual diversity observed in static evaluations are illusory: when adoption is fixed and time unfolds, individual diversity consistently decreases across all models. Our results highlight the need to move beyond static evaluations and explicitly account for feedback-loop dynamics when designing recommender systems."}

In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher."}

Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications."}

A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.\n  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.\n  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods."}

We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory.

In contrast, modern recommender platforms increasingly use complex interfaces such as carousels, which consist of multiple swipeable lists that enable complex user browsing behaviors.\n  In this paper, we study position-based click models in carousel interfaces and examine optimization methods, model structure, and alignment with user behavior. We propose three novel position-based models tailored to carousels, including the first position-based model without latent variables that incorporates observed examination signals derived from eye tracking data, called the Observed Examination Position-Based Model (OEPBM). We develop a general implementation of these carousel click models, supporting multiple optimization techniques and conduct experiments comparing gradient-based methods with classical approaches, namely expectation-maximization and maximum likelihood estimation.\n  Our results show that gradient-based optimization consistently achieve better click likelihoods. Among the evaluated models, the OEPBM achieves the strongest performance in click prediction and produces examination patterns that most closely align to user behavior. However, we also demonstrate that strong click fit does not imply realistic modeling of user examination and browsing patterns. This reveals a fundamental limitation of click-only models in complex interfaces and the need for incorporating additional behavioral signals when designing click models for carousel-based recommender systems."}

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts."}

To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization.

Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.\n  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%."}

Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents."}

Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance."}

Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors."}

The Expert Agent optimizes multi-turn goal preferences at the dialogue-trajectory level, while the Customer Service Agent generates responses strictly aligned with the selected strategy. We evaluate GOPO on public benchmarks and e-commerce customer service datasets, and introduce Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE), a sequence-level metric derived from real e-commerce interaction data. On the Mgshop dataset, GOPO improves TSE by 7.7% and 10.3% over PPO and Memento, with consistent gains in sequence-level reward and generation quality.

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering."}

Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.\n  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%."}

Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis.

An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal."}

We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters.

Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution. Evaluation is conducted using a transcript-grounded user simulator, enabling quantitative measurement of call coverage, factual accuracy, and human escalation behavior. Additional red teaming assesses robustness against prompt injection, out-of-scope, and out-of-context attacks. Experiments are conducted in the Real Estate and Specialist Recruitment domains, which are intentionally challenging and currently suboptimal for automation due to their reliance on real-time data. Despite these constraints, the assistant autonomously handles approximately 30 percents of calls, achieves near-perfect factual accuracy and rejection behavior, and demonstrates strong robustness under adversarial testing."}

Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies."}

Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency.

At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance.

Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains.

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail."}

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation."}

This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring."}

However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\\textbf{Ta}$ble $\\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \\leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding."}

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies."}

We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets."}

Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs."}

We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories. This work provides a contextual foundation for more systematic and theoretically informed narrative research in NLP by providing an overview to ongoing research efforts and the broader narrative studies landscape."}

This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints.

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations."}

We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms.

We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal."}

Most existing works are designed for a transductive setting, which learns dataset-specific embeddings and struggles to generalize to new KGs. Recent knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) improve cross-KG transfer, but they mainly exploit structural patterns and ignore rich multi-modal signals. We address these gaps by proposing a token-based foundation model (TOFU) for MMKGR, which exhibits strong generalization across different MMKGs. TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens. TOFU then employs a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms, aiming to process these tokens and obtain transferable features for MMKGR. Experimental results on 17 transductive, inductive, and fully-inductive MMKGs show that TOFU consistently outperforms strong KGFM and MMKGR baselines, delivering strong performance on unseen MMKGs."}

To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed."}

Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios."}

Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle to capture these structural semantics accurately, resulting in suboptimal performance. Graph-based RAGs structure such information in graphs, but the resulting graphs are often noisy and computationally expensive. Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely. To enhance the query-based reasoning and retrieval, our method decomposes a complex multi-hop query into a set of simple subqueries along cube dimensions and conquers each of them sequentially. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that MultiCube-RAG improves response accuracy by 8.9% over the average performance of various baselines. Notably, we also demonstrate that our method performs with greater efficiency and inherent explainability."}

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies."}

However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior."}

Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples.

Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency."}

To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks.

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios."}

We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs."}

The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support. Experimental results across five mainstream QA benchmarks and multi-task generation on GraphBench demonstrate that CogitoRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, showcasing superior capabilities in complex knowledge integration and reasoning."}

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities."}

To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior."}

To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory.

REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs."}

We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide.

We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness."}

This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models."}

Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models.

The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions."}

Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies."}

First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems."}

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains.

While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.\n  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems."}

We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically."}

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities."}

We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments.

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss."}

To address this, we introduce Distillation via Split Contexts (DiSC), a simple context-distillation based approach for continual knowledge adaptation. \\methodname~derives student and teacher distributions by conditioning on distinct segments of the training example and minimizes the KL divergence between the shared tokens. This allows us to efficiently apply context-distillation without requiring explicit generation steps during training. We run experiments on four post-trained models and two adaptation domains.

In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures.

In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods.

However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task.

These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual."}

Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs."}

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation."}

Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed."}

We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn.

They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback."}

While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."}

Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning."}

Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives."}

Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation.

Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention."}

In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling."}

To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines."}

We propose a feedback-loop model that captures implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic adoption of recommendations, and heterogeneous recommender systems. We apply the framework on online retail and music streaming data and analyze systemic effects of the feedback loop. We find that increasing recommender adoption may lead to a progressive diversification of individual consumption, while collective demand is redistributed in model- and domain-dependent ways, often amplifying popularity concentration. Temporal analyses further reveal that apparent increases in individual diversity observed in static evaluations are illusory: when adoption is fixed and time unfolds, individual diversity consistently decreases across all models. Our results highlight the need to move beyond static evaluations and explicitly account for feedback-loop dynamics when designing recommender systems."}

They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."}

We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines.

Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."}

In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection."}

This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."}

We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities."}

This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India.

The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints.

In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures.

For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures.

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."}

To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback."}

To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods.

Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data.

We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide.

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing."}

In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines.

Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature.

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation."}

They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods.

We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts."}

Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments.

Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines."}

In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.\n  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.\n  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation.

Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible."}

In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%.

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'.

In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."}

Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers."}

While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding."}

First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points. Importantly, both are functions of nearest neighbor relationships between points, not distances, making them applicable to various distance functions including inner product."}

We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation.

Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise."}

In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training.

Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios.

To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline."}

First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods. We also deploy MFLI in the system and report online experimental results demonstrating improved engagement, less popularity bias, and higher serving efficiency."}

We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining."}

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts."}

Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed \"extract then store,\" involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the \"store then on-demand extract\" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them."}

These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual."}

A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.\n  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.\n  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods."}

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering."}

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning."}

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."}

LLM-as-a-jury for Comparative Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."}

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail."}
